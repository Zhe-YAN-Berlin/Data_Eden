  "text": "       It is true  that  the Took  family had long  been  pre-eminent; for the  office  of  Thain had  passed  to them  (from the Oldbucks)  some  centuries  before,  and the chief  Took had borne that title ever since. The  Thain was  the  master  of  the  Shire-moot, and captain of  the Shire-muster  and  the  Hobbitry-in-arms,  but  as  muster  and moot  were only  held  in  times  of  emergency,  which no  longer occurred, the Thainship  had  ceased to be more  than  a  nominal dignity. The  Took  family was  still,  indeed,  accorded a   special respect, for it remained  both numerous and exceedingly wealthy, and  was  liable  to produce in ever y generation strong  characters  of  peculiar  habits and even adventurous temperament. The latter qualities, however, were   ####-now  rather  tolerated (in  the  rich) than  generally  approved. The custom  endured, nonetheless, of referring to the head of the  family  as The  Took,  and of  adding  to  his  name, if  required, a number: such  as Isengrim the  Second, for instance.       The only  real official  in the Shire  at  this date  was the Mayor  of  Michel Delving (or of the Shire), who was  elected every  seven years at the  Free Fair on the White  Downs at  the Lithe, that is at Midsummer.  As mayor   almost   his  only  duty   was  to  preside   at  banquets,  given   on  the  Shire-holidays,  which occurred at  frequent intervals. But  the  offices of  Postmaster and First Shirriff were attached  to  the  mayoralty, so that  he  managed  both the  Messenger Service  and  the  Watch.  These were the  only  Shire-services,  and the Messengers  were the  most  numerous,  and much the  busier of the two. By no means a ll Hobbits were lettered, but those who were  wrote constantly to all their friends (and a  selection  of their relations)   who lived further off than an afternoon's walk.       The Shirriffs was the name  that the  Hobbits gave to  their police, or   the nearest equivalent that they possessed. They had, of course, no uniforms  (such things being  quite unknown), only  a feather in their caps;  and they  were  in  practice rather haywards than policemen,  more concerned  with the  strayings of  beasts than of people. There were in all the Shire only twelve  of them, three in  each  Farthing,  for  Inside Work. A  rather larger body,  varying  at need,  was  employed  to  'beat  the  bounds', and to  see  that  Outsiders of any kind, great or small, did not make themselves a nuisance.       At the time  when this story begins the Bounders, as they were  called,  had been greatly  increased.  There  were  many reports  and  complaints  of  strange persons  and creatures prowling about the borders, or over them: the  first  sign  that all  was not  quite as  it  should be, and always had been  except  in tales and legends of  long ago. Few heeded the sign, and not even   Bilbo yet had any notion of what it portended. Sixty years  had passed since  he set out on his  memorable journey, and he was old  even for Hobbits,  who  reached a hundred  as often as not; but much evidently still remained of the  considerable  wealth that he  had brought back. How  much or  how  little he  revealed to no one,  not even to Frodo  his favourite 'nephew'. And he still  kept secret the ring that he bad found.   ####-   4. Of the Finding of the Ring             As is  told in The Hobbit, there came one day to Bilbo's door the great  Wizard, Gandalf the Grey, and thirteen dwarves with him: none other, indeed,  than Thorin Oakenshield,  descendant  of kings, and his twelve companions in  exile. With  them he set  out, to his own lasting astonishment, on a morning  of  April, it being then  the year 1341 Shire-reckoning, on a quest of great  treasure, the dwarf-hoards of the Kings under the Mountain,  beneath  Erebor  in Dale, far off in the East. The quest was  successful, and the Dragon that  guarded the hoard was destroyed. Yet, though before  all  was won the Battle  of Five Armies was fought, and Thorin was slain, and  many deeds  of  renown  were done, the matter would scarcely have concerned later history, or earned  more than a note in the long annals of the Third Age, but for an  'accident'  by the way.  The  party was assailed by  Orcs in a  high pass  of  the Misty  Mountains as they went towards Wilderland; and so it happened that Bilbo was  lost for a while in the black orc-mines deep under the mountains, and there,  as he groped  in vain in the dark, he put  his hand on  a ring, lying on the  floor of a tunnel. He put it in h is pocket. It seemed then like mere luck.       Trying to find  his way out. Bilbo went on  down to  the  roots  of the  mountains, until he could go no further.  At the bottom  of the tunnel lay a   cold lake far  from the light, and on an island  of rock  in the water lived  Gollum. He was a loathsome little creature: he paddled a small boat with his  large  flat feet,  peering with pale luminous eyes  and  catching blind fish  with his long fingers, and eating  them raw."
