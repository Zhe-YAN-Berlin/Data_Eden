  "text": " After some  stars another hand begins,   and I can see we found  truesilver,  and  later the  word wellforged and then   something, I have it! mithril; and  the last two  lines Uin to  seek for the  upper  armouries of  Third  Deep,  something go westwards, a blur, to Hollin  gate .'       Gandalf paused and set a few leaves  aside. 'There are several pages of  the same sort, rather hastily  written and much damaged, he said; `but I can  make little of  them in  this light.  Now  there must  be a number of leaves  missing, because they  begin  to  be numbered  five,  the fifth year  of the  colony,  I suppose. Let  me see! No, they  are too cut and stained; I cannot  read them. We might do  better  in the sunlight.  Wait! Here is something: a   large bold hand using an Elvish script.'       'That would be Ori's hand,' said Gimli, looking  over the wizard's arm.  `He could write well and speedily, and often used the Elvish characters.'       `I  fear  he had  ill tidings to record in a  fair hand,' said Gandalf.   'The first clear word is sorrow, but the rest of the line is lost, unless it  ends in estre. Yes, it  must  be  yestre followed by day being  the tenth of  novembre Balin lord of Moria fell in Dimrill Dale. He went alone  to look in   Mirror mere.  an orc shot him from behind a stone. we slew the orc, hut many  more  ... up  from  east up  the Silverlode. The remainder of the page is so  blurred that I can hardly make anything out, but I think  I can read we have  barred the gates, and then can  hold them long if , and then perhaps horrible   and  suffer. Poor Balin! He seems to have kept  the  title that he  took for   less than five years. I wonder  what happened afterwards;  but there  is  no  time to  puzzle  out the last few pages. Here  is the last page of  all.' He  paused and sighed.       `It  is grim reading,' he said. 'I fear their end was cruel. Listen! We  cannot get  out.  We cannot get out. They have  taken the  Bridge and second  hall. Frbr and Luni and  Nbli fell there. Then there are four lines  smeared  so  that I can only read went 5 days  ago. The last lines run the pool is up  to  the wall  at Westgate. The Wa tcher in  the Water took Uin. We cannot get  out. The  end comes, and then  drums, drums in the deep. I wonder what  that  means. The last thing written is in a  trailing  scrawl of elf-letters: they  are coming.  There is  nothing more.'  Gandalf paused  and stood  in  silent   ####-thought.       A sudden dread and a horror  of  the chamber fell on  the  Company. `We   cannot get out,' muttered Gimli. 'It was  well for us that the pool had sunk   a little, and that the Watcher was sleeping down at the southern end.'       Gandalf raised  his  head and  looked  round. `They seem to have made a   last  stand by both doors,'  he  said; 'but there were not many left by that  time. So ended the  attempt to retake Moria! It was valiant but foolish. The  time is not come yet. Now,  I fear, we must say  farewell  to  Balin  son of  Fundin.  Here  he must  lie in the halls of his  fathers.  We will take this  book,  the Book  of Mazarbul, and look at  it  more  closely  later. You had  better keep it, Gimli, and take it  back  to Dbin, if  you get a chance.  It  will interest him, though it will grieve  him deeply. Come, let  us  go! The  morning is passing.'       'Which way shall we go? ' asked Boromir.       'Back to the hall,' answered  Gandalf. 'But  our visit to this room has  not been  in vain. I now know where we are. This must be, as Gimli says, the  Chamber of Mazarbul; and the hall must be the twenty-first of the North-end.  Therefore we  should leave by  the  eastern arch of the hall, and bear right  and south, and go downwards. The Twenty-first  Hall should be on the Seventh  Level, that is six above the level of the Gates. Come now! Back to the hall!  '       Gandalf had hardly spoken these words, when there came a great noise: a   rolling  Boom that seemed  to come  from depths far below, and to tremble in  the stone at their feet. They sprang towards  the door  in alarm. Doom, doom  it rolled  again, as  if huge  hands were turning the very caverns  of Moria   into a vast drum. Then there came an echoing blast: a great  horn  was blown  in  the hall,  and answering horns  and harsh cries  were heard further off.  There was a hurrying sound of many feet.       `They are coming! ' cried Legolas.        'We cannot get out,' said Gimli.       `Trapped! ' cried Gandalf. `Why  did I delay? Here we are, caught, just  as they were before. But I was not here then. We will see what ----'       Doom, doom came the drum-beat and the walls shook.       'Slam the doors and wedge them! ' shouted Aragorn. 'And keep your packs  on as long as you can: we may get a chance to cut our way out yet.'       `No! ' said Gandalf. 'We must not get shut in. Keep the east door ajar!  We will go that way, if we get a chance.'   ####-     Another  harsh  horn-call and shrill cries  rang out.  Feet were coming  down the corridor."
