'Well then,' he said, 'if  Strider will  provide what is  needed, I will smoke and think. I had some of Saruman's best in my pack, but  what became of it in the battle, I am sure I don't know.'       'Master  Meriadoc,'  said  Aragorn,  'if  you  think that  I have passed  through the  mountains and the realm of Gondor with  fire and sword to bring  herbs to a  careless soldier who throws away his gear,  you are mistaken. If  your pack has not been found, then you must send for the herb-master of this   ####-House. And he will tell you that he  did  not know that the herb  you desire  had  any  virtues, but  that it is  called westmansweed by  the vulgar,  and  galenas by the  noble,  and  other names  in other tongues more learned, and  after adding  a few half-forgotten  rhymes that he  does not understand,  he  will regretfully inform  you  that there is none in the  House, and  he will  leave you  to reflect  on  the history of tongues.  And so now must I. For I  have not slept in such a bed as this, since I rode from Dunharrow, nor eaten  since the dark before dawn.'       Merry seized his hand and kissed it. 'I am frightfully sorry,' he said.  'Go at once!  Ever since that night at Bree we have been  a nuisance to you.  But it is the way of my people to use light words at such times and say less  than they mean. We fear to say too much. It robs us of the  right words when   a jest is out of place.'       'I  know that well, or I would not deal with you in the same way ' said  Aragorn. 'May the Shire live for ever unwithered!' And kissing Merry he went  out, and Gandalf went with him.        Pippin  remained behind. 'Was  there  ever any one like him?'  he said.  'Except Gandalf, of course. I think they  must be related. My dear ass, your  pack is lying by your bed, and you  had  it on your back when I  met you. He  saw it all the time, of course. And anyway I have some stuff of my own. Come  on now! Longbottom Leaf it is.  Fill up while I run and see about some food.  And  then let's be  easy for  a bit. Dear me!  We Tooks  and Brandybucks, we  can't live long on the heights.'       'No,' said Merry. 'I can't. Not yet, at any rate. But at least, Pippin,  we can now see them, and honour them. It is best to  love first what you are  fitted to love, I suppose: you must start somewhere and have some roots, and  the soil of the Shire is deep. Still there are things deeper and higher; and  not a gaffer could tend his garden  in  what he calls  peace  but  for them,  whether  he knows about them or not.  I am  glad that   I know about them,  a   little. But I don't know why I am talking like this. Where is that leaf? And  get my pipe out of my pack, if it isn't broken.'       Aragorn and  Gandalf went now to the  Warden of the  Houses of Healing,  and they counselled him that Faramir and Jowyn should remain there and still  be tended with care for many days.       'The Lady Jowyn,' said Aragorn, 'will wish soon to rise and depart; but  she should not be  permitted to do so,  if you  can in any way restrain her,  until at least ten days be passed.'   ####-     'As for Faramir,' said Gandalf, 'he must soon  learn that his father is  dead. But the full  tale of the  madness  of Denethor should  not be told to  him, until  he is quite  healed and has duties to do. See  that Beregond and  the perian who were present do not speak to him of these things yet!'       And the other perian Meriadoc who is  under my care, what of him?' said  the Warden.       'It  is likely that  he will  be  fit  to arise tomorrow, for  a  short  while,' said Aragorn.  'Let him do so, if he  wishes. He may walk a little in  the care of his friends.'       'They are a remarkable race,' said the Warden, nodding his head.  'Very  tough in the fibre, I deem.'       At the  doors of the Houses many were already gathered to  see Aragorn,   and they  followed  after him; and when at last he  had supped, men came and  prayed that he would heal their kinsmen or their friends whose lives were in  peril through hurt or wound, or who lay under the Black  Shadow. And  Aragorn  arose and went out, and he sent for  the sons of  Elrond,  and together they  laboured  far into the  night. And word went through the City: 'The  King is  come again indeed.' And they named  him Elfstone, because of the green stone  that  he wore, and so  the name  which it was for etold at his  birth that he  should bear was chosen for him by his own people.       And when he  could labour no  more,  he cast his  cloak  about him, and  slipped out of the City, and went to his tent just ere dawn and  slept for a   little. And in the morning the banner of  Dol Amroth, a  white ship  like  a   swan upon blue water, floated from the Tower, and men looked up and  wondered  if the coming of the King had been but a dream.     ####-   Chapter 9. The Last Debate            The morning came after  the  day of battle, and it was fair with  light  clouds and the wind turning  westward."
