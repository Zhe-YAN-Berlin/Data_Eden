'There is  a  way down inside, yes.  Now  we  follows it  -- out,  out away over there.' He pointed south and east  towards  the marshes. The reek of them came to their nostrils, heavy and foul even in  the cool night air. .       Gollum  cast up and down along the  brink,  and at length he  called to  them.  `Here! We can get down here. Smjagol went  this way once: I went this  way, hiding from Orcs.'       He led the way, and following him  the  hobbits climbed  down into  the  gloom. It  was  not difficult,  for  the  rift was at this  point only  some  fifteen feet deep and about  a dozen across. There  was running water at the  bottom: it was in fact the bed of one of the many small rivers that trickled  down  from the  hills to feed  the  stagnant pools and mires beyond.  Gollum  turned to the  right, southward  more  or less, and splashed  along with his  feet in the  shallow  stony stream. He seemed greatly  delighted to feel the  water, and chuckled to himself, sometimes even croaking in a sort of song.       The cold hard lands,       they bites our hands,       they gnaws our feet.       The rocks and stones       are like old bones       all bare of meat.       But stream and pool       is wet and cool:       so nice for feet!       And now we wish --       'Ha! ha! What does we wish?' he said,  looking sidelong at the hobbits.   'We'll tell you.' he croaked. `He  guessed it long ago, Baggins guessed it.'  A glint  came  into his  eyes, and Sam  catching the gleam in  the  darkness   ####-thought it far from pleasant.       Alive without breath;       as cold as death;       never thirsting, ever drinking;       clad in mail, never clinking.       Drowns on dry land,       thinks an island       is a  mountain;       thinks a fountain        is a puff of air.       So sleek, so fair!       What a joy to meet!       We only wish       to catch a fish,       so juicy-sweet!       These  words only made  more pressing to Sam's mind a problem that  had  been  troubl ing him  from the moment when he  understood that hir master was  going  to adopt Gollum as a guide: the problem of food. It  did not occur to  him that his master might also  have thought of  it. hut he  supposed Gollum  had.  Indeed how had Gollum kept  himself  in all his lonely wandering? 'Not  too well,'  thought Sam. 'He looks fair famished. Not too dainty to try what  hobbit tastes like  if there ain't  no  fish, I'll wager -- supposing  as he  could catch us napping. Well, he won't: not Sam Gamgee for one. '       They stumbled along in the dark winding gully for a long time, or so it  seemed to the tired feet of Frodo and Sam. The gully turned eastward, and as  they went on it broadened and got gradually shallower. At last the sky above   grew faint with the  first  grey  of morning. Gollum  had shown  no signs of  tiring, but now he looked up and halted.       `Day  is near,'  he whispered,  as  if  Day  was  something  that might  overhear  him and spring on  him. `Smjagol will stay here: I will stay here,  and the Yellow Face won't see me.'       `We should be glad to see the Sun;' said Frodo, `but we will stay here:  we are too tired to go any further at present.'       `You are not  wise  to  be glad of the  Yellow Face,' said  Gollum. `It  shows you up. Nice sensible hobbits stay with Smjagol. Orcs and nasty things  are about. They can see a long way. Stay and hide with me! '       The three of them settled down to rest at the foot of the rocky wall of   ####-the gully.  It was not much more than a  tall man's  height now,  and at its  base there were wide flat shelves  of dry stone; the water ran in a  channel  on  the  other side. Frodo and Sam sat  on one of  the  flats, resting their  backs. Gollum paddled and scrabbled in the stream.       `We must  take a little food,' said Frodo. `Are you hungry, Smjagol? We  have very little to share, but we will spare you what we can.'       At the word hungry a greenish light  was kindled in Gollum's pale eyes,   and they seemed to protrude further than ever from his thin sickly face. For   a  moment  he  relapsed into his old  Gollum-manner. 'We are famisshed,  yes  famisshed we are. precious,' he  said. `What is it they eats? Have they nice  fisshes? ' His tongue lolled out between his sharp yellow teeth. licking his  colourless lips.        `No, we have  got no fish,' said Frodo. `We have only  got this'  -- he  held up a wafer of lembas -- 'and water, if the water here is fit to drink.'       `Yess,  yess,  nice water,' said  Gollum. `Drink it, drink it, while we  can! But what is it they've got, pr ecious? Is it crunchable? Is it tasty? '       Frodo  broke  off a portion  of a wafer  and handed it  to him  on  its  leaf-wrapping. Gollum  sniffed at the leaf and  his face changed: a spasm of  disgust came over it, and a hint of his old malice."
