  "text": " He needed speed and  had to humour  unwilling followers. He was healing Merry in orc-fashion; and  his treatment worked swiftly. When he had forced a drink from his flask down  the  hobbit's throat, cut his leg-bonds, and dragged him to  his feet, Merry  stood up, looking pale but grim  and defiant, and very  much alive. The gash  in his forehead gave him  no  more trouble, but he bore a  brown scar to the  end of his days.        'Hullo, Pippin!' he said.  'So you've come on  this  little expedition,  too? Where do we get bed and breakfast?'       'Now then!' said Ugl®k.  'None of that!  Hold your tongues. No  talk to  one another. Any  trouble will be  reported at the other end, and He'll know  how to pay  you. You'll  get bed and breakfast  all right: more than you can  stomach.'       The orc-band  began to descend a  narrow ravine  leading down into  the  misty plain below.  Merry and  Pippin,  separated by a  dozen  Orcs or more,  climbed down with  them. At the  bottom  they  stepped on to  grass, and the  hearts of the hobbits rose.       'Now  straight on!'  shouted Ugl®k. 'West  and a  little  north. Follow  Lugdush.'       'But what are we going to do at sunrise?' said some of the Northerners.        'Go on running,' said Ugl®k. 'What do you think? Sit  on the  grass and  wait for the Whiteskins to join the picnic?'       'But we can't run in the sunlight.'       'You'll run with me  behind you,' said Ugl®k. 'Run! Or you'll never see   ####-your beloved  holes again. By  the White Hand! What's the use of sending out  mountain-maggots  on  a trip, only half trained. Run, curse  you! Run  while  night lasts!'       Then the whole  company  began to  run  with the long loping strides of  Orcs. They kept  no order, thrusting, jostling, and cursing; yet their speed  was very great. Each hobbit had a guard of three. Pippin was far back in the  line. He  wondered how long he would be able to  go on at this pace: he  had  had no food since the morning. One of  his guards had a whip. But at present  the orc-liquor was still hot in him. His wits, too, were wide-awake.       Every now and again there  came  into his mind unbidden a vision of the   keen face of Strider bending over a dark trail, and running, running behind.  But  what  could even a Ranger see except a confused  trail of orc-feet? His  own  little prints  and Merry's  were overwhelmed by  the  trampling of  the  iron-shod shoes before them and behind them and about them.       They had  gone  only a mile  or so from the cliff when the  land sloped  down into a wide shallow depression, where the ground was soft and wet. Mist  lay there, pale-glimmering in the  last rays of  the  sickle moon.  The dark  shapes of the Orcs in front grew dim, and then were swallowed up.       'Ai! Steady now!' shouted Ugl®k from the rear.       A sudden thought leaped into Pippin's mind, and he acted on it at once.  He  swerved aside to the right, and  dived out of the reach of his clutching  guard, headfirst into the mist; he landed sprawling on the grass.        'Halt!' yelled Ugl®k.       There was for a moment turmoil and confusion. Pippin sprang up and ran.  But the Orcs were after him. Some suddenly loomed up right in front of him.       'No hope  of escape!' thought Pippin. 'But there is a hope  that I have  left  some of  my own marks unspoilt on the  wet ground.' He groped with his  two tied hands at his throat, and unclasped the brooch of his cloak. Just as  long arms and  hard claws seized him. he  let it fall. 'There  I  suppose it  will lie until the end of time,' he thought. 'I don't  know why I did it. If  the others have escaped, they've probably all gone with Frodo.'       A whip-thong curled round his legs, and he stifled a cry.       'Enough!' shouted Ugl®k running  up. 'He's still got to run a long  way  yet. Make 'em both run! Just use the whip as a reminder.'       'But that's not  all,' he snarled, turning to Pippin. 'I shan't forget.  Payment is only put off. Leg it!'       Neither  Pippin nor Merry remembered  much  of the later  part  of  the   ####-journey. Evil  dreams and evil  waking were blended  into  a  long tunnel of  misery,  with hope  growing ever fainter behind.  They  ran, and  they  ran,  striving to keep up the  pace set by  the Orcs, licked  every now  and again  with a cruel thong cunningly  handled. If they halted or stumbled, they were  seized and dragged for some distance.       The  warmth  of  the orc-draught  had  gone. Pippin felt cold and  sick   again. Suddenly  he  fell face downward on the turf. Hard hands with rending  nails  gripped  and lifted him. He was  carried like a  sack  once more, and  darkness  grew about him:  whether the  darkness  of  another  night,  or  a   blindness of his eyes, he could not tell.       Dimly he became aware of voices clamouring: it seemed that  many of the  Orcs were demanding a halt. Ugl®k was shouting. He felt himself flung to the  ground,  and he lay as he fell, till black dreams  took  him."
