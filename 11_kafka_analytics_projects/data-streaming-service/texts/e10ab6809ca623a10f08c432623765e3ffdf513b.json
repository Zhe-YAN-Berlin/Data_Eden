  "text": " But I have never heard  this one. What is it  about -- the seven stars and seven stones?'       'About the palantnri of the Kings of Old,' said Gandalf.       'And what are they?'       'The name meant  that which looks far away. The Orthanc-stone was one.'       'Then it was not made, not made'  -- Pippin hesitated -- 'by the Enemy?'       'No,' said Gandalf. 'Nor by  Saruman. It is  beyond his art, and beyond   Sauron's too. The palantnri came from beyond Westernesse  from Eldamar.   The  Noldor made  them. Flanor himself,  maybe, wrought them, in days so long ago  that the time cannot be measured in years. But there is  nothing that Sauron  cannot turn to evil uses. Alas for  Saruman! It was his downfall,  as  I now  perceive.  Perilous to us all  are the devices  of an  art  deeper  than  we  possess ourselves. Yet he must bear the blame. Fool!  to keep it secret, for   his own  profit. No word did he ever  speak of it to any of the  Council. We  had not yet given  thought  to the fate of  the palantnri of Gondor  in  its  ruinous wars. By Men they were almost forgotten. Even  in Gondor they were a   secret known only to a few; in Arnor they were remembered only in a rhyme of  lore among the D®nedain.'       'What  did  the Men of old use  them for?' asked Pippin, delighted  and  astonished at getting answers to  so  many questions, and wondering how long  it would last.   ####-     'To  see far  off, and to converse in thought with  one  another,' said  Gandalf. 'In that way they long guarded and united the realm of Gondor. They  set up Stones at Minas Anor, and at  Minas Ithil, and at Orthanc in the ring  of Isengard. The  chief  and master of these was under  the Dome of Stars at  Osgiliath before  its ruin. The three others were far  away in the North. In  the house  of Elrond  it is told that they were at Ann®minas, and  Amon Syl,  and Elendil's Stone was on the Tower Hills that look towards M ithlond in the  Gulf of Lune where the grey ships lie.       'Each palantnr replied to each, but all those in Gondor were  ever open  to the view of Osgiliath.  Now  it appears that,  as the rock of Orthanc has  withstood  the  storms of time, so  there  the palantnr  of  that tower  has  remained.  But alone  it could do nothing but see small images of things far  off  and days remote. Very  useful, no doubt, that  was  to Saruman;  yet it  seems that he was not content. Further and further abroad he gazed, until  he  cast his gaze upon Barad-dyr. Then he was caught!       'Who knows where the lost Stones of Arnor and Gondor now lie buried, or   drowned deep? But  one. at least Sauron  must have obtained and  mastered to  his purposes. I guess that  it was the Ithil-stone,  for he took Minas Ithil  long ago and turned it into an evil place: Minas Morgul, it has become.       'Easy  it  is  now to guess how quickly the roving  eye of Saruman  was  trapped and held; and how  ever  since he has been persuaded  from afar, and  daunted when persuasion  would not serve. The biter bit, the  hawk under the  eagle's foot, the spider  in a  steel web!  How long, I  wonder, has he been  constrained to  come often to his glass for inspection and instruction,  and  the Orthanc-stone so bent towards Barad-dyr  that, if  any  save  a will  of  adamant now looks into it,  it will bear his mind and sight swiftly thither?  And  how it draws  one to itself! Have I  not  felt it?  Even now  my  heart  desires to test my will  upon it,  to see if I could not wrench it from  him  and turn it where I  would-to look across the wide seas of water and of time  to Tirion the Fair, and perceive the unimaginable hand and mind of Flanor at  their work, while both  the  White Tree and the  Golden were  in flower!' He  sighed and fell silent.       'I wish I had known all this before,' said Pippin. 'I had  no notion of  what I was doing.'       'Oh yes,  you had,' said  Gandalf. 'You  knew you were behaving wrongly  and  foolishly;  and you told yourself so,  though you did not listen. I did  not tell you all this before, because  it is only by  musing on all that has   ####-happened that I have at last  understood, even as we ride together. But if I   had spoken sooner, it would not have lessened your desire, or made it easier   to  resist.  On the  contrary! No, the burned hand teaches best. After  that  advice about fire goes to the heart.'       'It does,' said  Pippin. 'If all the seven  stones were laid out before  me now, I should shut my eyes and put my hands in my pockets.'       'Good!' said Gandalf. 'That is what I hoped.'       'But I should like to know--' Pippin began.       'Mercy!' cried Gandalf. 'If the giving of information is to be the cure  of your inquisitiveness, I shall spend all the rest of my  days in answering  you. What more do you want to know?'       'The  names  of all the stars, and of all living  things, and the whole  history of Middle-earth and Over -heaven and of  the Sundering Seas ' laughed  Pippin. 'Of  course!  What less? But I  am  not in  a hurry tonight."
