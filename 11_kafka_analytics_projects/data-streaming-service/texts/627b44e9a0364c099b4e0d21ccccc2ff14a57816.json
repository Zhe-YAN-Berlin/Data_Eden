We  came when we heard the horn-but too late, it  seems. I  fear  you have taken  deadly hurt.'   ####-     'Boromir  is dead,' said Aragorn. 'I am unscathed,  for  I was not here  with him. He fell defending the hobbits, while I was away upon the hill.'       'The hobbits!' cried Gimli 'Where are they then? Where is Frodo?'       'I do not know,' answered Aragorn wearily. 'Before he died Boromir told  me that the Orcs had  bound them;  he  did not think that they were  dead. I  sent him  to follow  Merry and Pippin; but I did not ask him if Frodo or Sam  were with him: not until it was too  late.  All  that I have done  today has  gone amiss. What is to be done now?'       'First  we must tend the fallen,'  said Legolas. 'We  cannot  leave him  lying like carrion among these foul Orcs.'       'But we must be swift,' said Gimli. 'He would not wish us to linger. We  must follow the Orcs, if there is hope  that  any of our Company are  living  prisoners.'       'But we do not know whether the Ring-bearer is with them  or not ' said  Aragorn.  'Are we to abandon him? Must we not seek him first? An evil choice  is now before us!'       'Then let us do first what we must do,' said  Legolas. 'We have not the  time or the tools to bury our comrade fitly, or to raise a mound over him. A  cairn we might build.'       'The labour would be hard and long:  there are no stones that we  could  use nearer than the water -side,' said Gimli.       'Then  let us lay him in a boat with his weapons, and the weapons of his  vanquished foes,' said Aragorn. 'We will send him to the Falls of Rauros and   give him to Anduin. The River of Gondor will take care at least that no evil  creature dishonours his bones.'       Quickly  they searched the bodies of  the Orcs, gathering  their swords  and cloven helms and shields into  a  heap. 'See!' cried  Aragorn. 'Here  we  find  tokens!' He picked  out  from the  pile  of grim weapons  two  knives,   leaf-bladed, damasked  in go ld and red;  and searching further he found also  the sheaths,  black, set with small red gems. 'No orc-tools these!' he said.  'They were  borne by  the hobbits.  Doubtless the  Orcs despoiled them,  but  feared  to keep  the knives,  knowing  them  for  wha t  they  are:  work  of  Westernesse, wound about with spells  for the  bane of Mordor. Well, now, if  they still  live,  our  friends are  weaponless. I will  take these  things,   hoping against hope, to give them back.'       'And  I,' said Legolas,  'will take all the arrows that I can find, for   my quiver is empty.' He  searched  in the  pile  and on the ground about and   ####-found not a few that were undamaged and longer in the shaft than such arrows  as the Orcs were accustomed to use. He looked at them closely.       And  Aragorn looked on the slain, and he said: 'Here  lie many that are  not folk of Mordor. Some are from the North, from the Misty  Mountains, if I  know  anything of Orcs and their kinds.  And here are others  strange to me.   Their gear is not after the manner of Orcs at all!'       There were four goblin-soldiers of greater  stature, swart, slant-eyed,  with thick  legs and  large hands. They  were armed with short  broad-bladed  swords, not with  the curved scimitars usual with Orcs: and they had bows  of  yew, in length and shape like the bows of Men.  Upon their shields they bore  a strange device: a small white hand in the centre of a black field; on  the  front of their iron helms was set an S-rune, wrought of some white metal.       'I have not seen  these tokens  before,'  said Aragorn.  'What  do they  mean?'       'S is for Sauron,' said Gimli. 'That is easy to read.'       'Nay!' said Legolas. 'Sauron does not use the Elf-runes.'       'Neither  does he  use  his right name,  nor permit it  to be  spelt or  spoken,' said Aragorn. 'And he does  not use white. The  Orcs in the service  of Barad-dyr use the sign of the Red Eye.' He stood for a moment in thought.  'S is for Saruman, I  guess,'  he  said at length. 'There  is evil afoot  in  Isengard,  and the West is no longer safe. It is  as Gandalf feared: by some  means the traitor Saruman has had news of our journey. It is likely too that  he  knows  of  Gandalf's  fall.  Pursuers  from Moria may  have escaped  the  vigilance of Lurien, or they may have avoided that land and come to Isengard  by other  paths. Orcs travel  fast.  But  Saruman has many  ways of learning  news. Do you remember the birds?'       'Well,  we  have no time to ponder riddles,' said  Gimli. 'Let us  bear  Boromir away!'       'But  after that  we  must guess  the riddles, if we  are to choose our  course rightly,' answered Aragorn.       'Maybe there is no right choice,' said Gimli.       Taking his axe the  Dwarf now  cut  several branches. These they lashed  together with bowstrings, and spread their  cloaks upon the frame."
