'That's all right, Mr. Frodo,' said Sam, rubbing  his sleeve across his   ####-eyes. `I understand. But I can still help, can't I? I've got to get  you out  of  here. At  once, see! But first you want  some clothes  and gear and then  some food.  The clothes will be the  easiest part. As we're in Mordor, we'd,  best  dress up Mordor -fashion;  and anyway there isn't no choice. It'll have  to  be orc-stuff  for you, Mr.  Frodo,  I'm afraid. And for me too. If we go  together, we'd best match. Now put this round you!'       Sam unclasped his grey cloak and cast it about Frodo's  shoulders. Then  unslinging his pack he laid  it on the floor. He drew Sting from its sheath.  Hardly a flicker was to be seen upon  its blade. `I was forgetting this, Mr.  Frodo,' he said.  `No, they didn't get everything! You lent me Sting, if you   remember, and the Lady's glass. I've  got them both still. But  lend them to  me a little longer, Mr. Frodo. I must go  and see what  I can find. You stay  here. Walk about a bit and ease your legs. I shan't be long.  I shan't  have  to go far.'       `Take  care,  Sam!'  said Frodo. `And be quick! There may be orcs still  alive, lurking in wait.'       'I've  got to chance  it,' said  Sam. He  stepped to the  trap-door and  slipped down the ladder. In a  minute  his head reappeared. He threw  a long  knife on the floor.       `There's something that might be  useful,' he said. 'He's dead: the one  that  whipped  you. Broke his neck, it seems, in his hurry. Now you draw  up  the ladder, if  you can, Mr. Frodo;  and don't you let it down till you hear  me call the password. Elbereth   I'll call. What  the Elves say. No orc would  say that.'         Frodo sat  for a while and shivered, dreadful fears chasing one another  through his mind. Then he  got up, drew the grey elven-cloak about him,  and  to keep his mind occupied, began to walk to and fro, prying and peering into  every corner of his prison.       It was not very long, though fear made it seem an hour at least, before  he  heard Sam's voice calling softly from  below:  Elbereth, Elbereth . Frodo  let  down the light ladder. Up  came Sam, puffing, heaving a great bundle on   his head. He let it fall with a thud.       `Quick now. Mr.  Frodo!' he said. `I've had a  bit of  a search to find  anything  small enough for the likes of us.  We'll have  to make do.  But we  must hurry. I've met nothing alive, and  I've seen nothing but I'm not easy.  I think this place is being watched. I can't explain it, but well: it  feels   ####-to me as  if  one of those foul flying Riders was about, up in the blackness  where he can't be seen.'       He opened  the  bundle. Frodo  looked in  disgust at  the contents, but  there was nothing for it: he had to put the  things on, or go  naked.  There  were  long hairy breeches of some unclean beast -fell,  and a  tunic of dirty  leather. He  drew them on. Over the  tunic  went a coat  of stout ring-mail,  short for  a  full-sized  orc,  too long for  Frodo  and heavy. About it  he  clasped  a belt, at which there hung a  short  sheath holding a broad-bladed  stabbing-sword.  Sam  had brought  several  orc-helmets. One of  them fitted   Frodo well enough, a black  cap with iron rim, and  iron  hoops covered with  leather  upon  which  the  evil  Eye was  painted  in red above the beaklike  nose-guard.       `The Morgul-stuff,  Gorbag's gear,  was  a better fit and better made,'  said Sam;  `but it  wouldn't do,  I  guess, to go  carrying his  tokens into  Mordor,  not  after  this  business here. Well,  there you are, Mr. Frodo. A  perfect little orc, if I may make so bold-at least you would be, if we could  cover your face with a mask,  give you longer arms, and make you bow-legged.  This  will  hide some of the tell-tales.' He put a large  black cloak  round  Frodo's shoulders. `Now you're ready! You can pick up a shield as we go.'       'What about you, Sam?' said Frodo. `Aren't we going to match?'       `Well, Mr. Frodo, I've been  thinking,' said Sam. 'I'd best  not  leave  any of my stuff behind, and we can't destroy it.  And  I can't wear orc-mail  over all my clothes, can I? I'll just have to cover up.'       He knelt  down  and  carefully  folded his elven-cloak. It went  into a   surprisingly small roll. This  he  put into his pack  that lay on the floor.  Standing up, he slung  it behind his back,  put an orc-helm on  his head, and  cast another  black cloak about  his  shoulders. `There!' he  said. `Now  we  match, near enough. And now we must be off!'       'I can't go all the way at a run, Sam,' said Frodo with a wry smile. 'I   hope you've made inquiries about inns along the road? Or  have you forgotten  about food and drink?'       `Save me,  but so  I had!' said Sam.  He whistled in dismay. 'Bless me,  Mr. Frodo, but you've gone and made me that hungry and thirsty! I don't know  when   drop or  morsel last passed my lips."
