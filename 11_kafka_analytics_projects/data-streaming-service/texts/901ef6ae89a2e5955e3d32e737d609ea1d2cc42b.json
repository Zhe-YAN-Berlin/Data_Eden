There is  great vigour  in  the  waters  that come down  from the snows  of  the Misty  Mountains.'       `Yes,  it all  comes  back  to  me now,'  said  Frodo:  'the tremendous  roaring. I thought I was drowning, with my friends  and enemies and all. But  now we are safe!'       Gandalf  looked quickly at Frodo,  but he had shut his  eyes. 'Yes, you   are all safe for the present. Soon there will be feasting and merrymaking to  celebrate the  victory at the Ford  of Bruinen, and you will all be there in  places of honour.'       'Splendid!' said Frodo. `It is  wonderful  that Elrond, and  Glorfindel  and such great lords, not to  mention Strider, should take so  much  trouble  and show me so much kindness.'       `Well, there  are many reasons why they should,' said Gandalf, smiling.  `I am one good reason. The Ring is another: you are the Ring-bearer.  And you   are the heir of Bilbo, the Ring-finder.'       `Dear Bilbo!' said Frodo sleepily. `I wonder where he is. I wish he was  here and could hear  all  about it.  It would have  made  him laugh, The cow  jumped  over the  Moon!  And  the poor old troll!'  With that he  fell  fast   asleep.       Frodo was now safe in the Last Homely House east of the Sea. That house  was, as Bilbo had long ago reported, `a perfect house, whether you like food  or sleep, or story-telling or singing, or just sitting and thinking best, or  a  pleasant  mixture  of  them all'.  Merely  to  be  there was  a cure  for   weariness, fear, and sadness.        As the evening drew on, Frodo  woke up again, and he found  that  he no   ####-longer felt in need of rest or sleep, but had a mind for food and drink, and  probably  for singing and story-telling  afterwards. He got  out of  bed and  discovered that his  arm was  already nearly as useful again as it ever  had  been. He found  laid ready  clean garments  of  green cloth that  fitted him  excellently. Looking  in a mirror  he  was  startled to see  a  much thinner   reflection  of  himself than  he remembered: it  looked remarkably like  the  young nephew of Bilbo who used to go tramping  with his uncle in  the Shire;  but the eyes looked out at him thoughtfully.       `Yes, you  have seen a thing or two since  you last  peeped  out  of  a   looking-glass,' he said to his reflection. 'But now for a merry meeting!'       He stretched out his arms and whistled a tune.       At that moment there  was a knock on the door,  and Sam came in. He ran  to Frodo and took his left hand,  awkwardly and shyly. He stroked it  gently   and then he blushed and turned hastily away.       `Hullo, Sam!' said Frodo.       `It's  warm!' said Sam. `Meaning your hand, Mr.  Frodo. It has  felt so  cold through  the long nights. But glory  and trumpets!'  he cried,  turning  round again with shining  eyes and dancing  on  the floor. 'It's fine to see  you up and yourself again, sir! Gandalf asked me to come and see if you were  ready to come down, and I thought he was joking.'       'I  am ready,' said Frodo.  'Let's  go  and  look  for the rest  of the  party!'       `I can  take you to them,  sir,' said Sam. `It's a  big house this, and  very  peculiar. Always a bit more to discover,  and no  knowing  what  you'll  find round a corner. And Elves, sir! Elves  here, and Elves there! Some like  kings, terrible and splendid;  and some  as merry as children. And the music  and the singing-not that I have had the time or the heart for much listening  since we got here. But I'm getting to know some of the ways of the place.'       'I know  what you have  been doing,  Sam,' said Frodo,  taking his arm.  'But you  shall be merry tonight,  and listen to your  heart's content. Come  on, guide me round the corners!'       Sam led him  along several passages and down many steps and out  into a  high garden above the  steep bank of the river. He found his friends sitting  in a  porch on the side of the house looking east. Shadows had fallen in the  valley below,  but there was still a light on the faces of the mountains far  above. The air was warm. The sound of running  and falling  water  was loud,  and the evening  was filled with a  faint scent  of trees and flowers, as if   ####-summer still lingered in Elrond's gardens.        `Hurray!' cried Pippin, springing  up.  `Here is our noble cousin! Make  way for Frodo, Lord of the Ring!'       'Hush!' said Gandalf from the shadows at the back  of the  porch. `Evil  things do  not  come into this valley; but all  the same we should not  name  them. The Lord of the Ring is not Frodo, but the master of the Dark Tower of  Mordor, whose  power is  again stretching out over the world! We are sitting   in a fortress. Outside it is getting dark.'       `Gandalf  has been saying many cheerful things like that,' said Pippin.  `He thinks I need keeping in  order.  But it  seems impossible, somehow,  to   feel  gloomy or depressed in  this place."
