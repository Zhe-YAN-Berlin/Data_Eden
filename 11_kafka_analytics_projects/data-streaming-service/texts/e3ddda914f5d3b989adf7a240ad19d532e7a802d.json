'Not  another letter  you've forgotten. I hope,  Mr.  Butterbur?'  said  Merry.       'Now, now, Mr.  Brandybuck, don't go reminding me of  that! But  there,   you've  broken my  thought. Now where was I? Nob,  stables, ah! that was it.  I've something that  belongs to  you.  If you recollect Bill  Ferny  and the  horsethieving: his pony as you bought,  well,  it's  here. Come  back all of  itself, it did. But where it had been to you know better than me. It was  as  shaggy as an old dog and as lean as a clothes-rail, but it  was alive. Nob's  looked after it.'       'What! My Bill?' cried Sam. 'Well, I was born lucky, whatever my gaffer   may say. There's another  wish come true! Where is he?' Sam  would not go to  bed until he had visited Bill in his stable.       The travellers stayed in Bree all the next day, and Mr. Butterbur could  not complain of his  business next evening at any  rate. Curiosity  overcame   all fears,  and his house was  crowded.  For a while  out of politeness  the  hobbits  visited the Common  Room in the evening  and  answered a  good  many  questions. Bree memories being retentive,  Frodo was  asked many times if he  had written his book.       'Not yet,' he answered. 'I am going home now to put my notes in order.'  He promised to deal  with the amazing events at Bree, and so  give a bit  of  interest to  a book that appeared likely to  treat mostly of  the remote and  less important affairs 'away south'.        Then  one of  the  younger folk called for  a song. But at that a  hush  fell,  and he was frowned  down,  and the  call  was not repeated. Evidently  there was no wish for any uncanny events in the Common Room again.   ####-     No trouble by day, nor  any sound by night, disturbed the peace of Bree  while the travellers remained there; but the next morning they got up early,  for  as the  weather  was still rainy they wished to reach the  Shire before  night, and it was a long ride. The Bree folk were  all out  to see them off,   and were in merrier mood than they had  been  for a year; and  those who had  not seen the  strangers in all  their gear before gaped with wonder at them:  at Gandalf with his white beard,  and  the light that  seemed to  gleam from  him, as if his  blue mantle was on ly a  cloud over sunshine; and at the four  hobbits like riders upon errantry out of almost  forgotten tales. Even those  who had laughed at all the talk about the King began to think there might be  some truth in it.       'Well, good luck on your road,  and good luck to your home-coming! said  Mr. Butterbur. 'I  should have warned you before that  all's not well in the  Shire neither, if what we  hear is true.  Funny goings on, they say. But one  thing drives out another, and I was full of my own troubles. But i f I may be  so  bold, you've come back  changed from your travels, and you look now like  folk as  can deal with troubles  out of hand. I don't  doubt you'll soon set  all to rights. Good  luck to you! And the  oftener you  come back the better   I'll be pleased.'       They wished  him  farewell  and  rode  away,  and  passed  through  the  West-gate and on  towards  the  Shire. Bill the  pony was with them, and  as  before he  had a  good deal of  baggage, but he trotted along beside Sam and  seemed well content.       'I wonder what old Barliman was hinting at,' said Frodo.       'I can guess some of it,' said Sam gloomily. 'What I saw in the Mirror:  trees cut down and all, and my old gaffer turned out of the Row.  I ought to  have hurried back quicker.'       'And something's wrong  with the Southfarthing evidently,'  said Merry.  'There's a general shortage of pipe-weed.'       'Whatever it  is,' said Pippin, 'Lotho will be at the bottom of it: you   can be sure of that.'       'Deep in,  but not at the bottom,' said Gandalf.  'You  have  forgotten  Saruman. He began to take an interest in the Shire before Mordor did.'       'Well,  we've  got you  with us,' said Merry,  'so things  will soon be  cleared up.'       'I am with you at  present,' said Gandalf, 'but soon I  shall not be. I  am not coming to the Shire. You must  settle its affairs yourselves; that is   ####-what  you have been trained for. Do you not yet understand? My time is over:  it is no longer my  task to set things to rights, nor to help folk to do so.  And  as for you ,  my dear friends, you will need no  help. You are  grown up  now. Grown indeed very high; among the  great you are,  and I have no longer   any fear at all for any of you.       'But if you would know, I am turning aside soon.  I  am going to have a   long talk with Bombadil: such a talk as I have not had in all my time. He is  a moss-gatherer, and I have been a  stone doomed to rolling. But  my rolling  days are ending, and now we shall have much to say to one another."
