'Saruman,' said Galadriel, 'we have other errands  and other cares that  seem  to us more  urgent  than  hunting  for  you. Say rather  that  you are  overtaken by good fortune; for now you have a last chance.'       'If it be truly the last, I am glad,'  said  Saruman;  'for I shall  be  spared the  trouble of  refusing it  again. All  my hopes are ruined,  but I  would not share yours. If you have any.'       For  a  moment his eyes kindled. 'Go!'  he said. 'I did   not spend long  study on these matters for naught. You have  doomed yourselves, and you  know  it. And it will afford me  some comfort as I wander to think that you pulled  down your own house  when you destroyed  mine. And now, what  ship will  bear  you back across so wide a sea?' he mocked. 'It will be a grey ship, and full  of ghosts.' He laughed, but his voice was cracked and hideous.        'Get up, you  idiot!' he shouted to the other  beggar, who had sat down  on the ground; and  he struck him with his staff. 'Turn about! If these fine  folk are going our way, then we will  take another. Get on, or I'll give you   no crust for your supper!'   ####-     The beggar  turned and slouched past  whimpering: 'Poor old Grnma! Poor   old Grnma!  Always beaten and cursed. How  I hate him!  I wish I could leave  him!'       'Then leave him!' said Gandalf.        But Wormtongue only shot a glance of his bleared eyes full of terror at  Gandalf, and then shuffled quickly past behind Saruman. As the wretched pair  passed  by the  company they came  to the hobbits, and Saruman  stopped  and  stared at them; but they looked at him with pity.       'So you have  come  to  gloat too, have you, my urchins?' he said. 'You   don't care what a beggar lacks, do you? For  you have all you want, food and  fine clothes, and the best weed for your pipes. Oh yes, I know! I know where  it comes from. You would not give a pipeful to a beggar, would you?'       'I would, if I had any,' said Frodo.       'You can have what I have  got left,' said Merry,  'if you will wa it  a   moment.' He got down and searched  in  the bag at his saddle. Then he handed  to Saruman a leather pouch.  'Take what there is,' he said. 'You are welcome  to it; it came from the flotsam of Isengard.'       'Mine, mine, yes and dearly bought!' cried  Saruman,  clutching  at the  pouch. 'This is only a repayment in token; for you took more, I'll be bound.  Still,  a beggar must  be grateful,  if a thief returns him even a morsel of  his own. Well, it  will serve you right  when you  come  home,  if  you find  things  less good in  the Southfarthing than you  would like. Long  may your   land be short of leaf!'       'Thank you!' said Merry. 'In that case I will have my pouch back, which  is not yours and has journeyed  far with me.  Wrap the weed in a rag of your   own.'       'One thief  deserves  another,' said  Saruman,  and turned his back  on  Merry, and kicked Wormtongue, and went away towards the wood.       'Well, I  like that!' said Pippin. 'Thief indeed! What of our claim for   waylaying, wounding, and orc-dragging us through Rohan?'       'Ah!' said Sam. 'And bought he said. How,  I  wonder? And I didn't like  the sound of what he said about the Southfarthing. It's time we got back.'       'I'm sure it is,' said Frodo. 'But  we can't go  any quicker, if we are  to see Bilbo. I am going to Rivendell first, whatever happens.'       'Yes, I  think  you  had better do that,' said Gandalf. 'But  alas  for   Saruman! I fear nothing more can be made of him. He has withered altogether.  All the same, I am not sure that  Treebea rd  is right: I  fancy he could  do   ####-some mischief still in a small mean way.'       Next day they went on into  northern Dunland, where  no men now  dwelt,  though  it was  a green and pleasant country. September came  in with golden  days  and  silver  nights, and they  rode  at  ease  until  they reached the  Swanfleet  river, and  found the  old ford, east of the  falls where it went  down suddenly into the lowlands. Far to the west in a haze lay the meres and  eyots through which it wound its way to the Greyflood: there countless swans  housed in a land of reeds.       So  they  passed into  Eregion,  and at last  a  fair  morning  dawned,  shimmering above gleaming mists;  and looking from their camp on a  low hill  the travellers saw away in the east the Sun catching three peaks that thrust   up into the sky through floating clouds: Caradhras, Celebdil, and Fanuidhol.   They were near to the Gates of Moria.       Here  now  for  seven  days they tarried, for the  time was at hand for   another parting which  they  were loth to make.  Soon Celeborn and Galadriel  and their folk would turn eastward, and so pass by the Redhorn Gate and down  the  Dimrill Stair to the  Silverlode  and to  their own  country."
