But there are few left in  Middle-earth  like Aragorn son  of Arathorn. The race of the Kings from over the Sea is nearly at an end. It  may be that this War of the Ring will be their last adventure.'       'Do  you  really  mean that  Strider is one  of the people of  the  old  Kings?' said Frodo in wonder.  `I thought  they had all vanished long ago. I  thought he was only a Ranger.'       'Only a Ranger!' cried Gandalf. `My dear Frodo,  that  is just what the  Rangers are: the last  remnant in the North  of the great people, the Men of  the  West.  They have helped  me  before; and I shall need their help in the  days  to come;  for we  have reached Rivendell, but the Ring is  not yet  at  rest.'       'I suppose not,' said Frodo. 'But  so far my  only thought has been  to  get here; and  I  hope I  shan't have to go any further. It is very pleasant  just to rest. I have had a month of exile and adventure, and I find that has  been as much as I want.'       He fell silent and shut his eyes. After a while he spoke again. 'I have  been reckoning,' he said, `and I can't bring  the  total up  to October  the  twenty-fourth. It ought to  be  the  twenty-first. We  must have reached the  Ford by the twentieth.'       'You have talked and reckoned more than is good for you,' said Gandalf.   `How do the side and shou lder feel now?'       'I don't know.' Frodo  answered. 'They don't feel at all: which  is  an  improvement, but'--he made  an  effort--'I can move my  arm again a  little.  Yes, it is coming back to life. It is not cold,' he added, touching his left   hand with  his right.   ####-     `Good!'  said  Gandalf.  `It is  mending  fast. You will soon be  sound  again. Elrond has cured you: he has tended you for days, ever since you were  brought in.'       'Days?' said Frodo.       `Well, four nights and three days,  to be  exact. The Elves brought you   from this where you lost  count.  We have been terribly anxious, and Sam has  hardly left  your  side, day or night, except to run  messages. Elrond is  a   master of healing, but the weapons of  our Enemy are deadly. To tell you the  truth, I had very little hope; for  I suspected that there was some fragment  of the blade still in the closed wound. But it could not be found until last   night.  Then Elrond  removed a  splinter. It  was deeply  buried. and it was  working inwards.'       Frodo shuddered, remembering the cruel knife  with notched  blade  that  had vanished in Strider's  hands. `Don't be alarmed!' said Gandalf.  `It  is  gone  now.  It  has  been  melted.  And  it  seems  that  Hobbits fade  very  reluctantly.  I  have known strong  warriors of  the Big  People  who  would  quickly have  been overcome by  that splinter, which you bore  for seventeen  days.'       `What would they have done  to me?' asked Frodo. `What  were the Riders  trying to do?'       'They tried to pierce your heart with a  Morgul-knife  which remains in  the wound. If they had succeeded, you would  have become like they are, only  weaker and  under their  command. You  would have became a wraith under   the  dominion of  the Dark Lord;  and he would have tormented you   for trying  to  keep his Ring,  if any greater torment were possible than being robbed of it  and seeing it on his hand.'       'Thank goodness  I  did  not  realize the horrible danger!' said  Frodo  faintly. I was mortally afraid, of course; but if I had k nown more, I should  not have dared even to move. It is a marvel that I escaped!'       'Yes, fortune or fate have helped you,' said Gandalf,  `not  to mention  courage. For your heart was not touched, and only your shoulder was pierced;  and that  was because you resisted to the last. But it was a terribly narrow  shave, so to  speak. You were in gravest peril while you  wore the Ring, for   then you were half in the wraith-world yourself, and they might have  seized   you. You could see them, and they could see you. '       `I know,' said Frodo.  `They were terrible to behold! But why  could we   ####-all see their horses?'       `Because  they are real horses; just as the black robes are real  robes  that they wear to give shape  to their  nothingness when  they have dealings  with the living.'       `Then  why do these black  horses endure such riders? All other animals  are terrified when  they draw  near, even  the elf-horse of  Glorfindel. The  dogs howl and the geese scream at them.'       `Because these horses are born and bred to the service of the Dark Lord  in Mordor. Not all his servants and chattels are wraiths! There are orcs and  trolls, there are wargs  and werewolves; and there have been  and  still are  many Men,  warriors and kings,  that walk alive under  the  Sun, and yet are  under his sway. And their number is growing daily.'       `What about Rivendell and the Elves? Is Rivendell safe?'       `Yes,  at present,  until all else is conquered."
