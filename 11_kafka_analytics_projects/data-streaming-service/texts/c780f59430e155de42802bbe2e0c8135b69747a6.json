That is news indeed, if it be  true. Know, little strangers, that Boromir  son of Denethor was High  Warden  of  the White Tower, and our Captain-General: sorely do we miss him. Who are  you then,  and  what had you  to do  with  him?  Be swift, for  the  Sun  is  climbing!'       'Are the riddling words known to you that Boromir brought to Rivendell?    ####-' Frodo replied.       Seek for the Sword that was Broken.       In Imladris it dwells.       'The words are known indeed,' said Faramir in astonishment. `It is some  token of your truth that you also know them.'       `Aragorn whom I named is the bearer of the Sword that was Broken,' said  Frodo. 'And we are the Halflings that the rhyme spoke of.'       `That I see,' said Faramir thoughtfully. `Or I see that it might be so.  And what is Isildur's Bane? '       `That is hidden,'  answered  Frodo. `Doubtless it will be made clear in  time.'       `We must  learn more of this,' said Faramir, `and know  what brings you   so far east under the shadow of yonder --,' he pointed and said no name. 'But  not now. We have business in hand. You are in peril.  and you would not have  gone far  by field or road this day.  There will be hard handstrokes nigh at  hand ere the day is full. Then death, or swift flight bark to Anduin. I will  leave two to guard you, for your  good and for mine. Wise  man trusts not to  chance-meeting on the road in this land. If I return, I will speak more with  you.'       'Farewell!' said Frodo, bowing low. `Think what you will, I am a friend  of  all enemies of the One Enemy. We  would go with you, if we halfling folk  could hope to serve  you, such doughty men and strong  as you seem, and if my  errand permitted it. May the light shine on your swords!'       'The  Halflings  are  courteous  folk,  whatever  else  they  be,' said  Faramir. `Farewell!'       The hobbits  sat  down  again, but  they said nothing to one another of  their thoughts and doubts. Close by, just  under the dappling  shadow of the  dark bay-trees, two men remained on guard. They took off their masks now and  again  to cool them,  as the  day-heat grew,  and Frodo  saw that  they were  goodly  men, pale-skinned, dark of hair, with  grey eyes and  faces sad  and  proud. They spoke together in soft voices, at first using the Common Speech,  but after the manner of older days, and then changing to another language of  their own. To his amazement, as he listened Frodo   became aware that  it was  the Elven-tongue that they spoke, or one but little different; and he looked  at  them with wonder, for he  knew  then that  they must be D®nedain  of the  South, men of the line of the Lords of Westernesse.       After a  while  he spoke to  them; but they were slow  and  cautious in   ####-answering. They named themselves Mablung and Damrod, soldiers of Gondor,  and  they were Rangers of Ithilien; for they  were descended  from folk who lived  in Ithilien  at  one time, before  it  was overrun. From  such  men the Lord  Denethor chose his forayers, who  crossed the Anduin secretly (how or where,  they would not say) to harry  the Orcs and other enemies that roamed between  the Ephel D®ath and the River.       `It  is close on  ten leagues hence to the east -shore of Anduin,'  said  Mablung, 'and we seldom come so far afield. But we have a new errand on this  journey: we come to ambush the Men of Harad. Curse them! '       'Aye, curse the Southrons! ' said Damrod.  ` 'Tis  said that there were  dealings  of  old between Gondor  and the kingdoms of the  Harad in  the Far  South; though there was never friendship. In those days our bounds were away  south beyond the mouths of Anduin, and Umbar, the nearest  of  their realms,   acknowledged our sway. But that is long since. 'Tis many lives of  Men since  any passed to or  fro between us. Now of late we have learned that the Enemy  has been among them, and they are gone over to Him, or back to Him-they  were  ever ready to His  will -as have so many also  in the East .  I doubt not that  the days of Gondor are numbered, and the  walls of Minas Tirith are  doomed,  so great is His strength and malice.'       `But still we will not sit idle  and  let Him do all as He would,' said  Mablung. `These cursed Southrons  come  now marching up the ancient roads  to  swell the hosts of  the Dark Tower.  Yea, up  the very roads  that  craft of  Gondor made.  And they go  ever more heedlessly, we learn, thinking that the  power of their new  master is great enough, so that the mere shadow  of  His  hills  will  protect  them.  We  come  to teach  them  another lesson. Great  strength of them was  reported  to us  some days ago, marching north. One of  their regiments is due by our reckoning to pass by, some time ere noon-up on  the road  above, where it passes through  the cloven way."
