The big root just twisted round and tipped me in!'       'You were dreaming  I expect, Mr. Frodo,'  said Sam. 'You shouldn't sit  in such a place, if you feel sleepy.'       'What  about the  others?' Frodo asked. 'I wonder  what sort of  dr eams  they are having.'       They went round to the other side of the tree, and  then Sam understood  the click that he had heard. Pippin  had vanished. The crack by which he had  laid himself had closed together, so that  not  a chink could be seen. Merry  was trapped: another crack had closed about his waist; his legs lay outside,  but the  rest of him was inside a dark opening, the edges of  which  gripped  like a pair of pincers.        Frodo and  Sam beat  first upon the  tree-trunk where Pippin had  lain.  They then struggled frantically to pull open the jaws of the crack that held  poor Merry. It was quite useless.        'What a  foul thing to happen!' cried Frodo  wildly. 'Why  did  we ever   come into this dreadful  Forest? I wish we were all back at Crickhollow! ' He  kicked the tree with all his strength, heedless  of  his own  feet. A hardly  perceptible shiver ran through the stem and up into the branches; the leaves  rustled and whispered, but with a sound now of faint and far-off laughter.       'I suppose we haven't  got an  axe among our luggage, Mr. Frodo?' asked  Sam.       'I  brought a  little hatchet for chopping firewood,' said Frodo. 'That  wouldn't be much use.'       'Wait a minute!'  cried  Sam, struck by an idea suggested by  firewood.  'We might do something with fire!'       'We might,' said Frodo doubtfully. 'We might succeed in roasting Pippin  alive inside.'     ####-       'We might try  to hurt or  frighten  this tree to begin with,' said Sam  fiercely. 'If it don't let them go,  I'll  have it down,  if  I have to gnaw  it.' He  ran to the ponies and before  long  came back with two tinder -boxes  and a hatchet.       Quickly they gathered dry grass and leaves, and bits  of bark; and made  a  pile  of broken twigs and chopped sticks. These  they heaped against  the  trunk  on the far side of the tree from  the prisoners. As soon  as Sam  had  struck  a spark into  the tinder,  it kindled the dry grass  and a flurry of  flame and smoke went up. The  twigs crackled. Little fingers  of fire licked  against  the dry scored rind of  the ancient tree and scorched  it. A tremor   ran through the whole  willow. The leaves  seemed to hiss above their  heads  with a sound of pain and anger. A loud  scream came from Merry, and from far  inside the tree they heard Pippin give a muffled yell.       'Put it out! Put it out!' cried Merry. 'He'll squeeze me in two, if you   don't. He says so!'       'Who?  What?' shouted Frodo,  rushing  round  to  the other side of the  tree.       'Put  it out! Put it  out!'  begged Merry.  The  branches of the wi llow  began to sway violently. There was a sound as of a wind rising and spreading  outwards  to the branches of all the other trees round about, as though they  had  dropped a stone into the quiet slumber  of the river -valley and  set up  ripples  of anger that  ran out  over the  whole  Forest. Sam kicked at  the  little fire and stamped out the sparks. But Frodo, without any clear idea of  why he did so, or what he hoped  for, ran  along the path crying help! help!  help! It seemed to him that he could hardly hear the sound of his own shrill  voice: it  was  blown away  from  him by  the willow-wind and drowned  in  a   clamour of leaves,  as soon as the  words left his mouth. He felt desperate:  lost and witless.        Suddenly  he  slopped.  There was an answer, or  so  he  thought; but it  seemed  to come from  behind him, away down  the  path  further back in  the  Forest.  He turned round and listened, and soon  there  could  be no  doubt:  someone was  singing a song; a deep glad voice  was  singing  carelessly and  happily, but it was singing nonsense:       Hey dol! merry dol! ring a dong dillo!       Ring a dong! hop along! fal lal the willow!       Tom Bom, jolly Tom, Tom Bombadillo!   ####-     Half hopeful and half afraid of some new danger, Frodo and Sam now both  stood still. Suddenly  out of  a long string of  nonsense-words (or so  they  seemed) the voice rose up loud and clear and burst into this song:       Hey! Come merry dot! derry dol! My darling!       Light goes the weather-wind and the feathered starling.       Down  along under Hill, shining in the sunlight,       Waiting on the doorstep for the cold starlight,       There my pretty lady is. River-woman's daughter,       Slender as the willow-wand, clearer than the water.       Old Tom Bombadil water-lilies bringing       Comes hopping home again. Can you hear him singing?       Hey! Come merry dol! deny dol! and merry-o,       Goldberry, Goldberry, merry yellow berry-o!       Poor old Willow-man, you tuck your roots away!       Tom's in a hurry now."
