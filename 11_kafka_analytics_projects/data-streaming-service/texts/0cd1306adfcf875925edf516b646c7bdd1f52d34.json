  "text": " Will you see that our ponies are ready by  eight o'clock?'       'Very  good! But  before  you go, I  should like  a  word  with you  in  private, Mr. Underhill. Something has just come back to my mind that I ought  to tell you. I hope that you'll not take it amiss. When I've seen to a thing  or two, I'll come along to your room, if you're willing.'       'Certainly!'  said Frodo; but his  heart  sank.  He wondered  how  many  private talks  he would have before  he  got to  bed,  and  what  they would  reveal. Were  these people  all in league against him?  He  began to suspect  even old Butterbur's fat face of concealing dark designs.       ####-<h4>Chapter 10</h4> <br>. Strider            Frodo, Pippin, and Sam made their way back to the parlour. There was no  light. Merry was not there, and the  fire had burned low.  It  was not until  they had puffed up the embers into a blaze and thrown on a couple of faggots  that they discovered Strider had come with them. There he was calmly sitting  in a chair by the door!       'Hallo!' said Pippin. 'Who are you, and what do you want?'       'I  am called Strider,' he answered: 'and  though he may have forgotten  it, your friend promised to have a quiet talk with me.'       'You  said  I  might  hear something to my advantage, I  believe,' said  Frodo. 'What have you to say?'       'Several things,' a nswered Strider. 'But, of course, I have my price.'       'What do you mean?' asked Frodo sharply.       'Don't be alarmed! I mean just this: I will tell you  what I  know, and  give you some good advice  - but I shall want a reward.'       'And what will that be, pray?' said Frodo. He suspected now that he had  fallen in with a rascal, and he thought uncomfortably  that  he had  brought  only a little money with him. All of it would hardly satisfy a rogue, and he  could not spare any of it.       'No more than  you  can afford,' answered  Strider with a slow smile, as  if he guessed Frodo's thoughts. 'Just this: you must take me along with you,  until I wish to leave you.'       'Oh, indeed!' replied Frodo, surprised, but not much relieved. 'Even if  I wanted another  companion, I should  not  agree to any such thing, until I  knew a good deal more about you, and your business.'       'Excellent!' exclaimed  Strider,  crossing  his legs  and sitting  back   comfortably. 'You seem to be coming to your senses again, and that is all to  the good. You have been much too careless so far. Very well! I will tell you   what I know, and leave the reward to  you. You may be glad to grant it, when  you have heard me.'       'Go on then!' said Frodo. 'What do you know?'       'Too much; too many dark things,' said Strider grimly. 'But as for your  business --' He got  up and went to the door,  opened it quickly  and looked  out.  Then  he shut it quietly and  sat  down again. 'I have quick ears,' he  went  on, lowering his voice, 'and  though I cannot disappear, I have hunted   ####-many  wild  and wary  things and I can usually avoid being  seen, if I wish.  Now, I was behind the hedge this evening on the Road west of Bree, when four  hobbits  came out  of the Downlands. I need not repeat all that they said to  old  Bombadil  or  to  one  another, but  one  thing interested  me.  Please  remember, said one of them,  that the name Baggins  must not be mentioned. I  am Mr. Underhill, if any name must be given. That interested me so much that  I followed them here.  I slipped  over the gate just behind them.  Maybe Mr.   Baggins  has  an  honest reason  for  leaving his name  behind; but if so, I  should advise him and his friends to be more careful.'       'I don't see what interest my name has for any one in Bree,' sa id Frodo  angrily,  'and I have still to  learn why  it interests you. Mr. Strider may  have an honest reason  for spying  and eavesdropping;  but  if so,  I should  advise him to explain it.'       'Well answered!' said Strider laughing. 'But the explanation is simple:       I was looking for  a Hobbit called Frodo Baggins. I wanted  to find him  quickly. I had learned that he was carrying out of the Shire, well, a secret  that concerned me and my friends.        'Now, don't mistake me!' he cried, as Frodo rose from his seat, and Sam  jumped up  with a scowl. 'I shall take more care of  the secret than you do.  And care  is  needed!' He leaned forward  and  looked at them. 'Watch  every  shadow!' he said in a  low  voice. 'Black horsemen have passed through Bree.  On  Monday one came down the Greenway, they say; and another appeared  later,  coming up the Greenway from the south.'       There was a silence. At last Frodo spoke to Pippin and Sam: 'I ought to  have guessed  it from the way the gatekeeper greeted us,' he said.  'And  the  landlord  seems  to  have heard something. Why did  he press us to join  the  company?  And  why  on  earth  did we  behave so foolishly: we ought to have  stayed quiet in here.'       'It would  have been better,' said Strider. 'I would  have stopped your  going into  the  common-room, if I could; but the innkeeper would not let me  in to see you, or take a message."
