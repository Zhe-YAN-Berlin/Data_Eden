Slowly on hand and knee the  hobbits  crawled  away  out of  the  turmoil, until  at last unnoticed  they  dropped  over the  further edge of the road. It  had a  high kerb  by  which  troop-leaders could  guide  themselves  in black night or  fog,  and it  was  banked up some feet above the level of the open land.       They  lay still   for a while.  It  was too dark to  seek  for cover, if  indeed there was any to  find; but Sam felt that  they ought at least to get  further away from the highways and out of the range of torch-light.       'Come on, Mr. Frodo!' he whispered.  'One more  crawl, and then you can  lie still.'       With a last despairing effort Frodo  raised  himself on  his hands, and  struggled on for maybe twenty yards. Then he pitched down into a shallow pit  that opened unexpectedly before them, and there he lay like a dead thing.   ####-     Chapter 3. Mount Doom            Sam put his ragged orc-cloak under  his master's head, and covered them  both with the grey robe of Lurien; and as he did so his thoughts went out to  that fair land, and to the Elves, and he hoped that the cloth woven by their  hands  might  have some virtue to keep them  hidden beyond all hope  in this  wilderness of fear. He heard the  scuffling and cries die down as the troops  passed  on through the Isenmouthe. It seemed that in the confusion  and  the  mingling of many  companies of various  kinds  they had not been missed, not  yet at any rate.       Sam  took a sip of water, but pressed Frodo  to  drink,  and  when  his  master had recovered a little he gave  him a whole  wafer of their  precious  waybread and made  him  ea t it. Then, too worn out even to  feel  much fear,   they stretched themselves out. They slept a little in uneasy fits; for their  sweat grew chill on  them, and the  hard stones bit them, and they shivered.  Out of  the north from the  Black Gate  through  Cirith  Gorgor there flowed  whispering along the ground a thin cold air.       In the morning a  grey light came again, for  in  the high regions  the  West Wind  still blew, but down on the stones behind the fences of the Black  Land the air seemed almost dead, chill  and yet stifling. Sam looked  up out  of the hollow.  The land  all about was  dreary, flat  and drab-hued. On the  roads nearby nothing was moving now; but Sam feared the watchful eyes on  the  wall  of  the  Isenmouthe,  no  more   than   a   furlong   away  northward.  South-eastward, far off like a  dark standing shadow. loomed  the  Mountain.  Smokes  were  pouring from  it and while those that rose into  the upper air  trailed away  eastward, great rolling clouds  floated  down  its  sides  and  spread over the land. A  few miles to the north-east the  foothills  of  the  Ashen  Mountains stood  like  sombre grey  ghosts, behind  which  the  misty  northern heights rose  like  a line of distant cloud hardly darker than  the  lowering sky.       Sam  tried to  guess the distances and to decide what way they ought to  take.  It looks every step  of fifty miles,' he muttered gloomily staring at  the threatening mountain, 'and that'll take a week, if it takes  a day, with  Mr. Frodo as he is.' He shook his  head,  and as he worked things out, slowly    ####-a new dark thought  grew in his mind. Never  for long had  hope died in  his  staunch  heart, and  always until now he  had  taken some thought  for their  return.  But the  bitter  truth  came  home to him  at  last:  at best their  provision  would take them to  their goal; and when the task was done, there  they would come to  an end,  alone, houseless, foodless  in  the midst  of a   terrible desert. There could be no return.       'So that was the job I felt I had to  do when  I started,' thought Sam:  'to help  Mr. Frodo to the last step and then die with him? Well, if that is  the job then I must do it. But I would dearly like to see Bywater again, and  Rosie Cotton and her brothers, and the Gaffer and Marigold  and all. I can't  think somehow that Gandalf would have sent Mr. Frodo on this errand if there  hadn't a' been  any hope  of his  ever coming back at all. Things  all  went  wrong when  he went  down  in Moria.  I  wish he hadn't. He  would have done  something.'       But even as hope died in Sam, or seemed to  die, it was turned to a new  strength. Sam's  plain  hobbit-face  grew stern,  almost  grim, as  the will  hardened in him, and he felt through  all his  limbs a thrill,  as if he was  turning into  some  creature  of   stone  and steel  that neither despair nor   weariness nor endless barren miles could subdue.       With  a new sense of responsibility he  brought  his  eyes  back to the  ground  near at hand, studying the  next move. As the light grew a little he  saw  to  his  surprise  that  what  from  a  distance  had  seemed  wide and  featureless  flats  were in fact  all broken  and tumbled. Indeed the  whole  surface of the plains of Gorgoroth was pocked with great holes, as if, while  it was still a waste of soft mud,  it had been smitten with a shower of bolts  and huge slingstones."
