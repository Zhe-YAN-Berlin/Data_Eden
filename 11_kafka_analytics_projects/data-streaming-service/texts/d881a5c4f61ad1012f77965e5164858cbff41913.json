'It is my shoulder. The  wound aches, and  the memory of darkness is heavy on me. It was a year ago today.'       'Alas!  there  are  some  wounds  that  cannot be  wholly  cured,' said  Gandalf.       'I  fear it may be so with  mine,'  said Frodo. 'There is no real going  back. Though I may come to the Shire, it will not seem the same; for I shall  not  be the same.  I am  wounded  with  knife, sting,  and tooth, and a long  burden. Where shall I find rest?'       Gandalf did not answer.       By the end of the next day  the pain and  unease had passed, and  Frodo  was merry again, as merry as if he did not remember the blackness of the day  before. After that the journey went well,  and the days went quickly by; for   they rode  at leisure,  and often they lingered in the fair  woodlands where  the leaves were red  and yellow  in the  autumn  sun. At length they came to   Weathertop; and  it was then drawing  towards  evening and the shadow of the  hill lay  dark  on the road. Then Frodo begged them to  hasten, and he would   not look towards the hill,  but rode through its shadow with  head bowed and  cloak drawn close about him. That night the weather changed, and a wind came  from the  West laden with rain, and it blew loud and  chill,  and the yellow  leaves whirled like birds in the air. When they came to the Chetwood already  the boughs were almost bare, and a great  curtain  of rain  veiled Bree Hill  from their sight.       So it was that near the end of a wild and wet  evening in the last days  of October the  five travellers rode up  the  climbing road and came  to the  South-gate of Bree.  It was locked fast; and the rain  blew in  their faces,    ####-and in the darkening sky low clouds went hurrying  by, and their hearts sank   a little, for they had expected more welcome.       When they had called many times, at last  the Gate-keeper came out, and  they saw that  he  carried a great cudgel. He looked at them  with  fear and  suspicion; but  when he saw that Gandalf  was there, and that his companions  were hobbits,  in spite of their strange gear, then he brightened and wished  them welcome.       'Come in!' he said,  unlocking  the  gate. 'We  won't stay for news out  here  in the  cold  and the wet, a ruffianly evening. But old Barley will no  doubt give you a welcome at The Pony, and there you'll hear all there is  to  hear.'       'And  there  you'll hear  later all  that  we say,  and  more,' laughed  Gandalf. 'How is Harry? '       The Gate-keeper scowled. 'Gone,' he said. 'But you'd best ask Barliman.  Good evening!'       'Good  evening  to  you!' they said, and passed through; and then  they  noticed  that  behind the  hedge at  the road-side a long low  hut had  been  built, and a  number of  men had come out and were staring at  them over the  fence. When they  came  to  Bill Ferny's house they saw that the hedge there  was tattered and unkempt, and the windows were all boarded up.       'Do you think you killed him with that apple, Sam?' said Pippin.       'I'm not so hopeful, Mr. Pippin,' said Sam. 'But  I'd like to know what  became  of that poor  pony. He's  been on my mind many a time and the wolves  howling and all.'       At last they  came  to  The Prancing  Pony,  and that at  least  looked  outwardly unchanged;  and  there were lights behind the red curtains  in the  lower windows. They rang the bell, and Nob came to the door, and opened it a   crack and peeped through; and when  he saw  them standing under the  lamp he  gave a cr y of surprise.       'Mr. Butterbur! Master!' he shouted. 'They've come back!'       'Oh  have  they? I'll learn them,' came  Butterbur's voice, and out  he  came with a rush, and he  had a club in his hand.  But when he  saw who they  were he stopped short, a nd the black scowl on his face changed to wonder and  delight.       'Nob,  you woolly-pated  ninny!'  he cried. 'Can't you give old friends  their names? You shouldn't go scaring  me like that, with times as they are.   ####-Well, well! And where have you come from? I never expected to see any of  you  folk again, and that's a fact: going  off into the Wild with  that  Strider,  and all those Black Men about. But I'm right glad to  see you, and none more  than Gandalf. Come in! Come  in!  The same rooms as  - before? They're free.  Indeed  most rooms  are empty  these  days, as I'll  not  hide from you, for   you'll find it out soon enough. And I'll see what can be done  about supper,  as soon as may be; but I'm short-handed at  present. Hey, Nob you slowcoach!   Tell Bob! Ah, but there I'm forgetting, Bob's gone: goes home to his folk at  nightfall now. Well, take the guests' ponies to the stables, Nob! And you'll  be  taking your horse to his  stable yourself Gandalf; I don't doubt. A fine  beast, as  I  said  when  I  first  set eyes  on  him."
