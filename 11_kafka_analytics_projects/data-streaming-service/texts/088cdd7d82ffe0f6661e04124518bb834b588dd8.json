He was clumsy and uncomfortable with his left hand, yet even so the steel seemed to flow through the air, as if it had a will of its own.  Wolves have claws, as much as bears.   The Old Bear seemed pleased by that.  I suppose they do. You’ll want to wear that over the shoulder, I imagine. It’s too long for the hip, at least until you’ve put on a few inches. And you’ll need to work at your two-handed strikes as well. Ser Endrew can show you some moves, when your burns have healed.    Ser Endrew?  Jon did not know the name.   Ser Endrew Tarth, a good man. He’s on his way from the Shadow Tower to assume the duties of master-at-arms. Ser Alliser Thorne left yestermorn for Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.   Jon lowered the sword.  Why?  he said, stupidly.  Mormont snorted.  Because I sent him, why do you think? He’s bringing the hand your Ghost tore off the end of Jafer Flowers’s wrist. I have commanded him to take ship to King’s Landing and lay it before this boy king. That should get young Joffrey’s attention, I’d think… and Ser Alliser’s a knight, highborn, anointed, with old friends at court, altogether harder to ignore than a glorified crow.    Crow.  Jon thought the raven sounded faintly indignant.   As well,  the Lord Commander continued, ignoring the bird’s protest,  it puts a thousand leagues twixt him and you without it seeming a rebuke.  He jabbed a finger up at Jon’s face.  And don’t think this means I approve of that nonsense in the common hall. Valor makes up for a fair amount of folly, but you’re not a boy anymore, however many years you’ve seen. That’s a man’s sword you have there, and it will take a man to wield her. I’ll expect you to act the part, henceforth.    Yes, my lord.  Jon slid the sword back into the silver-banded scabbard. If not the blade he would have chosen, it was nonetheless a noble gift, and freeing him from Alliser Thorne’s malignance was nobler still.  The Old Bear scratched at his chin.  I had forgotten how much a new beard itches,  he said.  Well, no help for that. Is that hand of yours healed enough to resume your duties?    Yes, my lord.    Good. The night will be cold, I’ll want hot spice wine. Find me a flagon of red, not too sour, and don’t skimp on the spices. And tell Hobb that if he sends me boiled mutton again I’m like to boil him. That last haunch was grey. Even the bird wouldn’t touch it.  He stroked the raven’s head with his thumb, and the bird made a contented quorking sound.  Away with you. I’ve work to do.   The guards smiled at him from their niches as he wound his way down the turret stair, carrying the sword in his good hand.  Sweet steel,  one man said.  You earned that, Snow,  another told him. Jon made himself smile back at them, but his heart was not in it. He knew he should be pleased, yet he did not feel it. His hand ached, and the taste of anger was in his mouth, though he could not have said who he was angry with or why.  A half dozen of his friends were lurking outside when he left the King’s Tower, where Lord Commander Mormont now made his residence. They’d hung a target on the granary doors, so they could seem to be honing their skills as archers, but he knew lurkers when he saw them. No sooner did he emerge than Pyp called out,  Well, come about, let’s have a look.    At what?  Jon said.  Toad sidled close.  Your rosy butt cheeks, what else?    The sword,  Grenn stated.  We want to see the sword.   Jon raked them with an accusing look.  You knew.   Pyp grinned.  We’re not all as dumb as Grenn.    You are so,  insisted Grenn.  You’re dumber.   Halder gave an apologetic shrug.  I helped Pate carve the stone for the pommel,  the builder said,  and your friend Sam bought the garnets in Mole’s Town.    We knew even before that, though,  Grenn said.  Rudge has been helping Donal Noye in the forge. He was there when the Old Bear brought him the burnt blade.    The sword!  Matt insisted. The others took up the chant.  The sword, the sword, the sword.   Jon unsheathed Longclaw and showed it to them, turning it this way and that so they could admire it. The bastard blade glittered in the pale sunlight, dark and deadly.  Valyrian steel,  he declared solemnly, trying to sound as pleased and proud as he ought to have felt.   I heard of a man who had a razor made of Valyrian steel,  declared Toad.  He cut his head off trying to shave.   Pyp grinned.  The Night’s Watch is thousands of years old,  he said,  but I’ll wager Lord Snow’s the first brother ever honored for burning down the Lord Commander’s Tower.   The others laughed, and even Jon had to smile. The fire he’d started had not, in truth, burned down that formidable stone tower, but it had done a fair job of gutting the interior of the top two floors, where the Old Bear had his chambers. No one seemed to mind that very much, since it had also destroyed Othor’s murderous corpse.  The other wight, the one-handed thing that had once been a ranger named Jafer Flowers, had also been destroyed, cut near to pieces by a dozen swords… but not before it had slain Ser Jaremy Rykker and four other men."
