  "text": " I desired to do  this  for my own satisfaction,  and  I had little hope that other people would  be  interested  in  this work, especially  since it was primarily  linguistic in  inspiration and  was begun  in order to provide  the necessary background of  'history' for Elvish tongues.       When  those  whose advice and opinion I sought corrected little hope to  no hope, I went back to the sequel, encouraged by  requests from readers for   more information concerning hobbits and their adventures. But the story  was  drawn  irresistibly  towards the  older world, and became an account,  as it  were, of its end and passing away  before its beginning and middle had  been  told. The process  had begun  in the writing  of The Hobbit, in which  there  were  already  some  references to the older  matter:  Elrond, Gondolin, the  High-elves, and the  orcs,  as  well as glimpses that had arisen unbidden of  things higher or deeper  or darker than its surface: Durin,  Moria, Gandalf,  the Necromancer,  the  Ring.  The  discovery  of the significance  of  these  glimpses and of  their relation to  the ancient histories revealed the Third  Age and its culmination in the War of the Ring.       Those who  had asked for  more information about hobbits eventually got   it, but they had to wait a long time; for the composition of The Lord of the  Rings went on at intervals during the  years 1936 to 1949, a period in which   I had  many  duties that  I did not neglect, and  many  other interests as a   learner and teacher  that often absorbed  me. The delay was, of course, also  increased by the outbreak of war in 1939, by the end of which  year the tale  had not yet reached  the  end  of Book  One. In spite of the darkness of the  next  five years I  found that the story could  not now be  wholly abandoned,   and  I plodded on, mostly  by night, till I stood  by Balin's tomb in Moria.  There I halted for a long while. It  was almost a  year later when I went on  and so came to Lothlurien and the Great River late in 1941. In the next year    ####-I  wrote the first drafts of the  matter  that now stands as Book Three, and  the beginnings of  chapters I and III of Book Five; and there as the beacons  flared in  Anurien  and Thjoden came to Harrowdale I stopped.  Foresight had  failed and there was no time for thought.       It was  during 1944  that, leaving the loose ends and perplexities of a   war which it was my task to  conduct, or at least to report, 1 forced myself  to tackle the journey of Frodo  to  Mordor.  These chapters,  eventually  to  become  Book Four,  were  written  and  sent  out  as  a  serial  to my son,  Christopher, then in South Africa with the RAF.  Nonetheless it took another  five  years before the tale was brought to its present end;  in that  time I  changed my house, my chair,  and my college,  and the days though  less dark  were no less laborious.  Then when the 'end' had  at last  been reached  the  whole story had to be revised, and indeed  largely re-written backwards. And  it had to be typed, and  re-typed: by me; the cost of professional typing by  the ten-fingered was beyond my means.       The Lord of the  Rings has been read by many  people since  it  finally  appeared in print; and I should like to say something here with reference to  the many opinions  or guesses that I  have  received or have read concerning  the motives  and meaning  of  the tale. The prime motive was the desire of a   tale-teller  to try  his hand at a  really long  story that would  hold  the  attention  of  readers, amuse them, delight  them, and at times maybe excite  them or deeply move them. As a guide I had only my own  feelings for what is  appealing or moving, and for  many the guide  was inevitably often at fault.  Some who have read the book, or at  any rate have reviewed it, have found it  boring, absurd, or contemptible; and I have no  cause  to complain, since  I  have similar opinions of  their works, or of the kinds  of writing that they  evidently  prefer. But even from the points of view of many who have enjoyed  my story there is much that fails to please. It is perhaps not possible in a   long tale to please everybody at  all  points, nor to displease everybody at  the same points; for I find from the letters that I have  received  that the  passages or chapters that are to some a blemish  are all by others specially  approved. The  most critical  reader of all, myself, now finds many defects,   minor and major, but  being fortunately under no obligation either to review  the book  or  to write  it again, he will pass over these in  silence, except  one that has been noted by others: the book is too short.       As for any inner meaning or  'message', it has in the intention  of the  author none. It is neither allegorical nor topical. As the story grew it put   ####-down roots  (into the past) and threw out unexpected branches: but  its main  theme was  settled from  the outset by the  inevitable choice of the Ring as  the link between it and  The Hobbit."
