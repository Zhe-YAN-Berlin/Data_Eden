At the brink   Gandalf halted and the others came up in a pack behind.       'Lead  the way,  Gimli! ' he said. 'Pippin and  Merry next. Straight on  and up the stair beyond the door! '       Arrows  fell  among them. One  struck Frodo  and  sprang  back. Another   pierced Gandalf's hat  and stuck there  like a black feather.  Frodo  looked  behind. Beyond  the fire  he saw swarming black figures: there seemed to  be  hundreds of orcs. They brandished spears and scimitars which  shone  red  as  blood in the firelight. Doom, doom rolled the drum-beats, growing louder and  louder, doom, doom.       Legolas  turned and set an arrow to the  string, though it  was  a long  shot for his small bow. He drew, but his hand fell, and the arrow slipped to  the ground. He  gave a cry of  dismay and  fear.  Two great trolls appeared;  they bore  great slabs  of stone, and flung  them down to serve as  gangways  over  the fire.  But  it was not the  trolls that  had filled the  Elf  with  terror. The  ranks of the orcs had opened, and they crowded away, as if they  themselves  were afraid.  Something was coming  up behind them.  What it was  could not be seen:  it was like a grea t shadow, in the middle of which was a   dark form, of man-shape maybe, yet greater; and a power and terror seemed to  be in it and to go before it.       It came to the edge of the fire and the  light faded as if a cloud  had  bent  over it. Then with  a rush it leaped  across the fissure.  The  flames  roared up to greet  it, and  wreathed about it; and a black smoke swirled in  the air. Its streaming mane kindled, and blazed behind it. In its right hand  was  a  blade like a stabbing tongue of fire;  in its left  it held a whip of  many thongs.       'Ai! ai! ' wailed Legolas. 'A Balrog! A Balrog is come! '       Gimli stared with wide eyes. `Durin's Bane! ' he cried, and letting his  axe fall he covered his face.       'A  Balrog,' muttered  Gandalf.  `Now I  understand.'  He  faltered and  leaned heavily on his staff. `What an evil fortune! And I am already weary.'   ####-     The dark figure streaming with fire raced towards them. The orcs yelled  and  poured over the stone gangways.  Then Boromir raised his horn and blew.   Loud  the challenge rang and bellowed, like the shout of many  throats under  the  cavernous  roof. For a  moment the orcs  quailed  and the  fiery shadow  halted.  Then the  echoes died as suddenly as  a  flame blown out by a  dark  wind, and the enemy advanced again.       'Over the bridge!' cried Gandalf, recalling his strength. `Fly! This is  a foe beyond any  of you. I  must hold the narrow  way.  Fly! '  Aragorn and  Boromir did not heed the command, but still held their ground, side by side,   behind Gandalf a t the  far end of the bridge. The others halted  just within  the doorway  at the hall's end, and turned, unable to leave their  leader to  face the enemy alone.       The Balrog reached the bridge. Gandalf stood in the middle of the span,  leaning on  the sta ff  in his left hand,  but  in his other  hand  Glamdring  gleamed,  cold and white. His enemy halted again, facing him, and the shadow  about it reached out like two vast wings. It raised the whip, and the thongs  whined and cracked. Fire came from its nostrils. But Gandalf stood firm.       `You cannot  pass,' he  said. The  orcs stood still, and a dead silence  fell. `I  am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor. You   cannot pass. The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udyn. Go back to  the  Shadow! You cannot pass.'       The  Balrog made  no  answer.  The fire in  it seemed to die,  but  the  darkness grew. It  stepped forward slowly on to  the bridge, and suddenly it  drew  itself  up to a  great height, and its wings were spread from wall  to  wall;  but still Gandalf could  be seen,  glimmering in the gloom; he seemed   small, and altogether alone: grey  and bent, like a  wizened tree before the  onset of a storm.       From out of the shadow a red sword leaped flaming.       Glamdring glittered white in answer.       There was a ringing clash and  a stab  of  white fire. The Balrog  fell  back  and its  sword flew  up in molten  fragments. The wizard swayed on the  bridge, stepped back a pace, and then again stood still.       'You cannot pass! ' he said.       With a bound the  Balrog leaped full  upon the bridge. Its whip whirled  and hissed.       'He cannot stand alone! ' cried Aragorn suddenly and ran back along the  bridge.  'Elendil!' he shouted. 'I am with you, Gandalf! '   ####-     `Gondor! ' cried Boromir and leaped after him.       At that moment Gandalf  lifted his staff, and crying aloud he smote the  bridge  before  him.  The  staff broke asunder and  fell  from  his  hand. A  blinding sheet of white  flame sprang  up. The  bridge cracked."
