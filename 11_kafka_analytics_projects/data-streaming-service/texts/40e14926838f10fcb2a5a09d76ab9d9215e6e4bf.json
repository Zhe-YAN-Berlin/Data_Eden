From dark Dunharrow in the dim morning       with thane and captain rode Thengel's son:       to Edoras he came, the ancient halls       of the Mark-wardens mist-enshrouded;       golden timbers were in gloom mantled.       Farewell he bade to his free people,       hearth and high-seat, and the hallowed places,       where long he had feasted ere the light faded.       Forth rode the king, fear behind him,       fate before him. Fealty kept he;       oaths he had taken, all fulfilled them.       Forth rode Thjoden. Five nights and days       east and onward rode the Eorlingas       through Folde and Fenmarch and the Firienwood,       six thousand spears to Sunlending,       Mundburg the mighty under Mindolluin,       Sea-kings' city in the South -kingdom       foe-beleaguered, fire-encircled.       Doom drove them on. Darkness took them,       Horse and horseman; hoofbeats afar       sank into silence: so the songs tell us.       It was indeed in deepening gloom that the king came to Edoras, although  it  was then but noon by the  hour. There  he halted only  a short while and  strengthened his host by some three  score  of Riders that  came late to the  weapontake. Now having eaten he made ready to set out  again, and  he wished  his esquire  a kindly farewell. But Merry begged for the last time not to be  parted from him.       'This is no journey for  such steeds  as  Stybba,  as I have told you '   ####-said  Thjoden.  'And  in such a battle as we think to  make on the fields of  Gondor what  would  you do, Master   Meriadoc, sword-thain though you be,  and  greater of heart than of stature?'       'As  for that,  who can tell?' answered Merry. 'But why, lord,  did you   receive me as sword-thain, if not to stay by your side? And I would not have  it said of me in song only that I was always left behind!'       'I  received you for your safe-keeping,' answered Thjoden; 'and also to  do  as I might bid. None of my Riders can  bear you as burden. If the battle  were before my gates, maybe your deeds would be remembered by the  minstrels;  but it  is a  hundred leagues and two to Mundburg  where Denethor is lord. I   will say no more.'       Merry  bowed and  went  away  unhappily,  and  stared  at the lines  of  horsemen. Already the companies were preparing to start: men were tightening  girths, looking  to saddles, caressing their horses; some gazed uneasily  at  the lowering sky. Unnoticed a Rider came up and spoke softly in the hobbit's  ear.       'Where will wants not, a way opens, so we say,' he whispered; 'and so I  have found myself.' Merry looked up and saw that it was the young Rider  whom  he had  noticed in the morning. 'You wish to go whither the Lord of the Mark  goes: I see it in your face.'       'I do,' said Merry.       'Then you  shall go with me,'  said the Rider. 'I will bear  you before  me, under my cloak until we are far afield, and this darkness is yet darker.  Such good will should not be denied. Say no more to any man, but come!'       'Thank you indeed!' said Merry. 'Thank you, sir, though I  do not  know  your name.'       'Do you not?' said the Rider softly. 'Then call me Dernhelm.'       Thus it  came to pass that  when the  king set out, before Dernhelm sat  Meriadoc the hobbit, and the great  grey steed  Windfola  made little of the  burden; for Dernhelm  was  less in  weight than many men, though  lithe  and  well-knit in frame.       On  into the shadow they  rode. In  the willow-thickets where Snowbourn  flowed into Entwash, twelve leagues east of Edoras,  they camped that night.  And  then on  again  through the Folde; and through  the  Fenmarch, where to   ####-their  right great  oakwoods climbed on the skirts of the  hills  under  the  shades of dark Halifirien by the borders of Gondor; but  away  to their left   the mists lay on the marshes fed by the mouths of Entwash. And as they  rode  rumour came of war in the North. Lone men, riding wild, brought word of foes  assailing their east -borders, of orc-hosts marching in the Wold of Rohan.       'Ride on! Ride on!'  cried Jomer. 'Too late now to turn aside. The fens  of Entwash must guard our flank. Haste now we need. Ride on!'       And  so King Thjoden departed from his own realm, and mile  by mile the  long  road  wound  away,  and  the  beacon  hills  marched  past:  Calenhad,  Min-Rimmon, Erelas, Nardol. But  their fires  were  quenched. All  the lands  were grey and still;  and  ever the shadow  deepened before them,  and  hope   waned in every heart.     ####-   Chapter 4. The Siege of Gondor            Pippin was  roused by Gandalf. Candles  were lit in their chamber,  for   only  a dim  twilight came  through the  windows; the air  was  heavy as with  approaching thunder."
