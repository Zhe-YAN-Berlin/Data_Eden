  "text": " To Merry the  ascent seemed  agelong,  a  meaningless journey in a hateful dream, going on  and on to some dim ending that memory cannot seize.       Slowly the  lights of  the torches in front of  him flickered  and went  out,  and he was walking in  a darkness; and he  thought: 'This  is a tunnel  leading to a tomb; there we shall stay forever.' But suddenly into his dream  there fell a living voice.       'Well, Merry! Thank goodness I have found you!'       He looked up  and the mist before his eyes  cleared a little. There was  Pippin! They were face  to face in a narrow lane,  and but for themselves it  was empty. He rubbed his eyes.        'Where is the  king?' he said.  'And Jowyn?' Then he stumbled  and  sat  down on a doorstep and began to weep again.       'They have gone up  into the Citadel,'  said  Pippin. 'I think you must   have fallen  asleep on your  feet and taken the wrong turning. When we found  that you were  not  with them,  Gandalf sent me to  look  for you.  Poor old  Merry! How glad  I am to see you again!  But  you are worn out, and  I won't   ####-bother you with any talk. But tell me, are you hurt, or wounded?'       'No,' said Merry. 'Well, no, I don't think so. But I can't use my right  arm, Pippin, not since I stabbed  him.  And my  sword burned all away like a  piece of wood.'       Pippin's face was anxious. 'Well, you had better come with me  as quick   as you can,' he said. 'I wish I could carry you. You aren't fit to walk  any  further. They shouldn't have let you walk at all; but you must forgive them.  So  many dreadful things have  happened  in the  City, Merry, that  one poor   hobbit coming in from the battle is easily overlooked.'       'It's not  always  a misfortune being overlooked,' said Merry.  'I  was  overlooked just now by  - no, no, I can't speak of it.  Help me, Pippin! It's  all going dark again, and my arm is so cold.'       'Lean on me, Merry lad!' said Pippin. 'Come now! Foot by foot. It's not  far.'       'Are you going to bury me?' said Merry.       'No, indeed!' said Pippin, trying  to sound cheerful, though  his heart  was wrung with fear and pity. 'No, we are going to the Houses of Healing.'       They turned out of the lane that ran  between tall houses and the outer   wall of the fourth circle, and they  regained the main street climbing up to  the Citadel. Step by step they  went, while Merry swayed and murmured as one  in sleep.       'I'll never  get him there,' thought  Pippin. 'Is there  no one to help  me? I can't leave him here.' Just then to his surprise a boy came running up  behind, and as he passed he recognized Bergil Beregond's son.       'Hullo,  Bergil!' he  called.  'Where  are you going?  Glad to  see you   again, and still alive!'       'I am running errands for the Healers,' said Bergil.  'I cannot stay.'       'Don't!'  said  Pippin.  'But  tell  them up  there that I have a  sick   hobbit, a perian  mind you, come from the battle-field. I don't think he can  walk so far. If Mithrandir is there, he will be glad of the message.' Bergil  ran on.       'I'd better wait here,'  thought  Pippin. So he let Merry  sink  gently  down on to the pavement in a patch of sunlight,  and then he sat down beside  him, laying Merry's head  in his lap. He felt his body and limbs gently, and  took his friend's hands in his own. The right hand felt icy to the touch.       It was  not long  before Gandalf himself  came  in  search  of them. He  stooped over Merry and caressed  his brow; then he lifted him carefully. 'He   ####-should have  been  borne in  honour  into this  city,' he said.  'He has well  repaid my trust; for  if Elrond had  not yielded to me, neither of you would  have  set  out; and then far more grievous would the  evils of this day have  been.' He sighed. 'And yet here is another charge on my hands, while all the  time the battle hangs in the balance.'       So at last  Faramir and  Jowyn and Meriadoc  were laid  in  beds in the  Houses of  Healing; and there they were tended well. For though all lore was  in  these latter days fallen  from its  fullness  of old, the  leechcraft of  Gondor was still wise, and skilled in the healing of wound and hurt, and all  such  sickness as east of  the Sea mortal men  were subject to. Save old age  only. For that  they had  found no  cure; and indeed the span of their lives  had now waned to little more than that of  other men, and those  among  them  who passed the tale of  five score years with vigour were grown few, save in   some houses of purer blood.  But now their art and  knowledge were  baffled;  for there  were  many sick of a  malady that  would not  be healed; and  they  called it the Black Shadow, for it came from the Nazgyl.  And those who were  stricken with it fell slowly into an ever deeper  dream, and  then passed to  silence and a deadly cold, and so died. And it seemed to  the tenders  of the  sick that on the Halfling and  on the Lady of Rohan this malady lay heavily."
