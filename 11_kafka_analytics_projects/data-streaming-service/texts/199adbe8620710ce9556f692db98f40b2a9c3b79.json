The woman knelt on the icy ground.  M’lord, I beg you—    Don’t beg me anything. Go back to your hall, you shouldn’t be here. We were commanded not to speak to Craster’s women.    You don’t have to speak with me, m’lord. Just take me with you, when you go, that’s all I ask.   All she asks, he thought. As if that were nothing.   I’ll… I’ll be your wife, if you like. My father, he’s got nineteen now, one less won’t hurt him none.    Black brothers are sworn never to take wives, don’t you know that? And we’re guests in your father’s hall besides.    Not you,  she said.  I watched. You never ate at his board, nor slept by his fire. He never gave you guest-right, so you’re not bound to him. It’s for the baby I have to go.    I don’t even know your name.    Gilly, he called me. For the gillyflower.    That’s pretty.  He remembered Sansa telling him once that he should say that whenever a lady told him her name. He could not help the girl, but perhaps the courtesy would please her.  Is it Craster who frightens you, Gilly?    For the baby, not for me. If it’s a girl, that’s not so bad, she’ll grow a few years and he’ll marry her. But Nella says it’s to be a boy, and she’s had six and knows these things. He gives the boys to the gods. Come the white cold, he does, and of late it comes more often. That’s why he started giving them sheep, even though he has a taste for mutton. Only now the sheep’s gone too. Next it will be dogs, till…  She lowered her eyes and stroked her belly.   What gods?  Jon was remembering that they’d seen no boys in Craster’s Keep, nor men either, save Craster himself.   The cold gods,  she said.  The ones in the night. The white shadows.   And suddenly Jon was back in the Lord Commander’s Tower again. A severed hand was climbing his calf and when he pried it off with the point of his longsword, it lay writhing, fingers opening and closing. The dead man rose to his feet, blue eyes shining in that gashed and swollen face. Ropes of torn flesh hung from the great wound in his belly, yet there was no blood.   What color are their eyes?  he asked her.   Blue. As bright as blue stars, and as cold.   She has seen them, he thought. Craster lied.   Will you take me? Just so far as the Wall—    We do not ride for the Wall. We ride north, after Mance Rayder and these Others, these white shadows and their wights. We seek them, Gilly. Your babe would not be safe with us.   Her fear was plain on her face.  You will come back, though. When your warring’s done, you’ll pass this way again.    We may.  If any of us still live.  That’s for the Old Bear to say, the one you call the Lord Crow. I’m only his squire. I do not choose the road I ride.    No.  He could hear the defeat in her voice.  Sorry to be of trouble, m’lord. I only… they said the king keeps people safe, and I thought…  Despairing, she ran, Sam’s cloak flapping behind her like great black wings.  Jon watched her go, his joy in the morning’s brittle beauty gone. Damn her, he thought resentfully, and damn Sam twice for sending her to me. What did he think I could do for her? We’re here to fight wildlings, not save them.  Other men were crawling from their shelters, yawning and stretching. The magic was already faded, icy brightness turning back to common dew in the light of the rising sun. Someone had gotten a fire started; he could smell woodsmoke drifting through the trees, and the smoky scent of bacon. Jon took down his cloak and snapped it against the rock, shattering the thin crust of ice that had formed in the night, then gathered up Longclaw and shrugged an arm through a shoulder strap. A few yards away he made water into a frozen bush, his piss steaming in the cold air and melting the ice wherever it fell. Afterward he laced up his black wool breeches and followed the smells.  Grenn and Dywen were among the brothers who had gathered round the fire. Hake handed Jon a hollow heel of bread filled with burnt bacon and chunks of salt fish warmed in bacon grease. He wolfed it down while listening to Dywen boast of having three of Craster’s women during the night.   You did not,  Grenn said, scowling.  I would have seen.   Dywen whapped him up alongside his ear with the back of his hand.  You? Seen? You’re blind as Maester Aemon. You never even saw that bear.    What bear? Was there a bear?    There’s always a bear,  declared Dolorous Edd in his usual tone of gloomy resignation.  One killed my brother when I was young. Afterward it wore his teeth around its neck on a leather thong. And they were good teeth too, better than mine. I’ve had nothing but trouble with my teeth.    Did Sam sleep in the hall last night?  Jon asked him.   I’d not call it sleeping. The ground was hard, the rushes ill-smelling, and my brothers snore frightfully. Speak of bears if you will, none ever growled so fierce as Brown Bernarr."
