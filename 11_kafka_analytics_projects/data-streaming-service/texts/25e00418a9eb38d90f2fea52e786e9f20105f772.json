  "text": "         At the top, as high as Gandalf could reach, was  an arch of interlacing  letters in an Elvish  character. Below,  though  the threads were in  places  blurred  or  broken,  the  outline could be seen of an  anvil  and  a hammer    ####-surmounted by a crown with seven  stars. Beneath these again were two trees,   each bearing crescent moons. More clearly than all else there shone forth in  the middle of the door a single star with many rays.        `There are the emblems of Durin!' cried Gimli.       `And there is the Tree of the High Elves!' said Legolas.        `And the Star of the House of Flanor,' said Gandalf. `They  are wrought  of  ithildin  that mirrors only starlight  and moonlight, and sleeps until it  is touched by one who speaks words now long forgotten in Middle-earth. It is  long since I heard them, and I thought deeply  before I could recall them to  my mind.'       'What does the writing  say?' asked  Frodo, who was trying  to decipher   the inscription on the arch. 'I thought I knew the elf-letters but  I cannot  read these.'       `The words are in  the elven-tongue of the West of  Middle-earth in the  Elder Days,' answered Gandalf.  'But they do not say anything  of importance  to us.  They say only: The Doors of Durin, Lord of Moria. Speak, friend, and  enter.  And  underneath  small and faint  is written:  I, Narvi,  made them.  Celebrimbor of Hollin drew these signs.'       `What does it mean by speak, friend, and enter?' asked Merry.       'That is plain enough,'  said  Gimli. `If  you are a friend,  speak the  password, and the doors will open, and you can enter.'       'Yes,' said Gandalf, 'these doors are probably  governed by words. Some  dwarf-gates will open only at special times, or for  particular persons; and  some have locks and keys that  are still needed when all necessary times and   words are known. These doors have no key. In the days of Durin they were not  secret. They usually  stood  open  and doorwards sat here. But  if they were  shut, any who  knew the opening word could speak it and pass in. At lea st so  it is recorded, is it not, Gimli? '       'It is,' said the dwarf. `But what the  word  was  is  not  remembered.  Narvi and his craft and all his kindred have vanished from the earth.'       'But do not you know the word, Gandalf? ' asked Boromir in surprise.       `No! ' said the wizard.       The others looked  dismayed;  only  Aragorn,  who  knew  Gandalf  well,  remained silent and unmoved.       'Then  what was  the use of bringing us to this  accursed spot?'  cried  Boromir, glancing back with a shudder at  the dark water. `You  told us that  you had  once passed  through the  Mines. How  could that be, if you did not   ####-know how to enter? '       `The answer to your first question, Boromir,' said the wizard, `is that  I do not know the word-yet. But we shall  soon see.  And,' he added,  with  a   glint in his eyes under their bristling brows, 'you may ask what  is the use  of my deeds when they are proved useless. As for your other question: do you  doubt  my  tale? Or have you no wits left? I did  not enter this way. I came  from the East.       `If you wish to know, I will tell you that these doors  open  outwards.   From the inside you may thrust them open with  your  hands. From the outside  nothing  will move  them  save  the spell of command.  They cannot be forced  inwards.'       `What  are  you going  to do  then? '  asked  Pippin, undaunted  by the  wizard's bristling brows.        `Knock on  the doors with your head, Peregrin Took,' said Gandalf. `But  if that does not shatter them, and I  am allowed a little peace from foolish  questions, I will seek for the opening words.       `I  once knew every spell in all the tongues  of Elves or  Men  or Orcs  that was  ever  used for such a purpose. I can still  remember  ten score of  them  without searching in  my mind. But on ly a few trials, I think, will be  needed;  and I  shall not  have  to call on  Gimli for  words  of the secret  dwarf-tongue  that  they  teach to none. The opening words were Elvish, like  the writing on the arch: that seems certain.'       He stepped up to the rock again, and lightly touched with his staff the  silver star in the middle beneath the sign of the anvil.       Annon edhellen, edro hi ammen!       Fennas nogothrim, lasto beth lammen!       he said  in a commanding voice.  The silver lines faded, but the  blank   grey stone did not stir.       Many times he  repeated these words in different order, or varied them.  Then  he tried other spells.  one  after another,  speaking  now faster  and  louder, now soft and slow. Then he spoke many single words of Elvish speech.  Nothing happened. The cliff towered into the night, the countless stars were  kindled, the wind blew cold, and the doors stood fast.       Again Gandalf approached the  wall, and lifting up his arms he spoke in  tones of command and rising wrath. Edro, edro! he cried, and struck the rock  with  his  staff."
