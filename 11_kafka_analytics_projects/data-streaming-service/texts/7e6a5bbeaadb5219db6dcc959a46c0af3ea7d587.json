Below  their refuge  were white  humps and domes and shapeless deeps beneath  which  the path  that they had trodden was  altogether lost;  but the heights above  were hidden in great clouds still heavy with the threat of snow.        Gimli looked up and shook his head. `Caradhras has not forgiven us.' he  said.  `He has more snow yet to fling at  us, if we go on.  The sooner we go  back and down the better.'       To this all agreed, but their retreat  was  now difficult. It might well  prove impossible. Only a few paces from the ashes of their fire the snow lay  many feet deep, higher than the heads of the hobbits; in places it  had been  scooped and piled by the wind into great drifts against the cliff.       `If  Gandalf  would go before us with  a bright  flame, he might melt a   path for you,' said Legolas. The storm had troubled him little, and he alone  of the Company remained still light of heart.       `If Elves could fly over mountains, they  might fetch  the Sun  to save   us,' answered Gandalf. `But I must have something to work on.  I cannot burn  snow.'       `Well,' said Boromir, `when heads are  at a  loss bodies must serve, as  we say in my  country. The strongest of us must seek a  way. See! Though all  is  now snow-clad,  our path, as  we came up, turned about that shoulder  of  rock down yonder. It was there that the snow first began to burden us. If we  could  reach that point, maybe it would prove easier  beyond. It  is no more  than a furlong off, I guess. '       `Then let us force a path thither, you and I!' said Aragorn.       Aragorn was the  tallest of the  Company, but  Boromir, little less  in  height, was  broader and heavier  in  build.  He led  the  way,  and Aragorn  followed  him.  Slowly  they  moved off, and were soon  toiling heavily.  In   ####-places the snow was breast -high, and often Boromir  seemed to bc swimming  or  burrowing with his great arms rather than walking.       Legolas watched  them for a while with a smile upon his lips,  and then  he turned to the others. `The strongest must seek a way, say you? But I say:  let a ploughman plough,  but choose an otter for swimming, and  for  running  light over grass and leaf or over snow-an Elf.'       With that he sprang forth nimbly, and  then Frodo noticed as if for the  first time, though he had long known it, that the Elf had no boots, but wore  only light shoes, as he always did, and his feet made little imprint  in the  snow.       'Farewell!' he said to Gandalf. `I go to find the Sun!' Then swift as a   runner over  firm sand he shot away, and quickly overtaking the toiling men,   with a  wave of his hand he passed them,  and  sped into  the  distance, and  vanished round the rocky turn.       The others  waited huddled together, watching until Boromir and Aragor n  dwindled into black specks  in the whiteness. At length they too passed from   sight. The time dragged on. The clouds lowered, and now a few flakes of snow  came curling down again.       An hour, maybe,  went by, though it seemed far longer, and then at last  they  saw  Legolas  coming  back.  At  the  same time  Boromir  and  Aragorn  reappeared round the bend far behind him and came labouring up the slope.       `Well,' cried Legolas as he ran up, `I have not brought the Sun. She is  walking in the blue fields of the South, and a little wreath of snow on this  Redhorn hillock troubles her not at all. But I have brought back a gleam  of  good hope for  those who are doomed  to  go on feet. There  is  the greatest   wind-drift of all just beyond the turn, and there our Strong Men were almost   buried. They despaired, until I  returned and told them  that the  drift was  little wider  than  a wall. And on  the  other  side the snow suddenly grows  less,  while further down  it  is no  more than  a white coverlet  to cool a   hobbit's toes.'       `Ah, it is as I  said,' growled Gimli. 'It was no ordinary storm. It is  the  ill  will of Caradhras. He  does not love Elves and  Dwarves, and  that  drift was laid to cut off our escape.'       'But happily your Caradhras has forgotten that you  have Men with you,'  said Boromir, who came up at that moment. `And doughty Men too, if I may  say   ####-it; though lesser  men with spades might have served you  better.  Still, we  have thrust a lane through the  drift; and for that all here may be grateful  who cannot run as light as Elves.'       `But  how are we  to get down there, even  if  you have cut through the  drift?' said Pippin, voicing the thought of all the hobbits.        'Have  hope!' said Boromir. 'I am weary, but I still have some strength  left, and  Aragorn too. We  will  bear the  little folk. The others no doubt  will make shift  to tread the path behind  us. Come, Master Peregrin! I will  begin with you.'       He lifted  up  the hobbit. 'Cling to  my back! I shall need my arms' he  said and  strode forward."
