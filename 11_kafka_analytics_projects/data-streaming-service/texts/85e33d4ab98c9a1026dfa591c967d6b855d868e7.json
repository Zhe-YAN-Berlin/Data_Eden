Sam  was chewing an  apple thoughtfully. He had a pocket full  of  them:  a parting  present from Nob and  Bob. 'Apples for walking, and a pipe   ####-for sitting,' he said. 'But I reckon I'll miss them both before long.'       The hobbits took no notice of the inquisitive heads that peeped  out of  doors,  or  popped over walls and fences,  as they passed. But as they  drew  near to  the further gate, Frodo saw a  dark  ill-kept  house behind a thick   hedge: the  last  house  in the village.  In one of the  windows he caught a   glimpse of a sallow face with sly, slanting eyes; but it vanished at once.       'So that's where that southerner is hiding!' he thought. 'He looks more  than half like a goblin.'       Over the hedge  another  man  was  staring boldly.  He  had heavy black   brows, and  dark scornful eyes; his large mouth curled in  a  sneer.  He was  smoking a  short black pipe. As they approached he took it out  of his mouth  and spat.       'Morning,  Longshanks!' he  said.  'Off  early?  Found some  friends at  last?' Strider nodded, but did not answer.  'Morning, my little friends!' he  said  to the  others. 'I suppose you know who you've taken  up  with? That's  Stick -at-naught  Strider,  that is!  Though  I've  heard other names not  so  pretty.  Watch out tonight! And you,  Sammie, don't  go ill-treating my poor   old pony! Pah!' He spat again.       Sam turned quickly. 'And you.  Ferny,' he said, 'put your ugly face out  of sight, or it will get  hurt.' With a sudden flick, quick as lightning, an  apple left his hand and hit Bill square on the nose. He ducked too late, and  curses  came from  behind  the  hedge.  'Waste  of a  good apple,'  said Sam  regretfully, and strode on.       At last  they  left  the  village  behind. The  escort of children  and  stragglers  that  had  followed  them  got  tired  and  turned  back at  the  South-gate. Passing through, they kept on along the Road for some  miles. It   bent to the left, curving back into its eastward line as it rounded the feet  of  Bree-hill,  and  then  it  began to run  swiftly downwards  into  wooded  country. To their left they could see some of the houses and hobbit-holes of  Staddle on the  gentler  south-eastern  slopes of  the hill; down in  a deep  hollow away north of the Road there were wisps of rising  smoke  that showed  where Combe lay;       Archet was hidden in the trees beyond.       After the  Road had run down some way, and  had left Bree-hill standing  tall and brown behind, they came on a narrow track that led off towards  the  North. 'This is where we leave  the open and take to cover,' said Strider.       'Not a \"short cut\", I hope,' said  Pippin.  'Our last short cut through   ####-woods nearly ended in disaster.'       'Ah, but you had not  got me with you then,' laughed Strider. 'My cuts,   short  or long, don't go wrong.' He took a look up and down the Road. No one  was in sight; and he led the way quickly down towards the wooded valley.       His  plan, as  far as  they  could understand  it without  knowing  the  country, was to go towards Archet at first, but to bear right and pass it on  the  east, and then to steer as straight as he could over the wild lands  to  Weathertop Hill. In that way they  would, if all went well,  cut off a great  loop of the Road,  which  further on bent southwards to avoid the Midgewater   Marshes.  But,  of  course, they  would have  to  pass  through  the marshes  themselves, and Strider's description of them was not encouraging.       However,  in the meanwhile, walking was not unpleasant.  Indeed, if  it  had not been for the disturbing events  of the night before, they would have  enjoyed this pan of the journey better than any up to that time. The sun was  shining, clear but not too hot. The woods in the valley were still leafy and  full  of  colour, and  seemed  peaceful  and wholesome. Strider   guided them  confidently among the many crossing paths, although left  to themselves they  would soon have  been at  a loss. He was taking a wandering course with many  turns and doublings, to put off any pursuit.       'Bill Ferny will have watched where we left the Road, for certain,'  he  said;  'though I don't think he  will follow  us himself. He  knows the land  round here well enough, but he knows he is not a  match for me in a wood. It  is what he may tell others that I am afraid of. I don't suppose they are far  away. If they think we have made for Archet, so much the better.'       Whether because  of Strider's skill or for some other reason,  they saw  no sign and heard no  sound of any other living thing all  that day: neither   two-footed,  except  birds;  nor  four-footed,  except  one  fox  and  a  few  squirrels."
