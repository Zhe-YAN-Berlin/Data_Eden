Mohor, guard the prisoners—    Arm us!  Tyrion sprang to his feet and seized her by the arm.  You will need every sword.   She knew he was right, Tyrion could see it. The mountain clans cared nothing for the enmities of the great houses; they would slaughter Stark and Lannister with equal fervor, as they slaughtered each other. They might spare Catelyn herself; she was still young enough to bear sons. Still, she hesitated.   I hear them!  Ser Rodrik called out. Tyrion turned his head to listen, and there it was: hoofbeats, a dozen horses or more, coming nearer. Suddenly everyone was moving, reaching for weapons, running to their mounts.  Pebbles rained down around them as Lharys came springing and sliding down the ridge. He landed breathless in front of Catelyn Stark, an ungainly-looking man with wild tufts of rust-colored hair sticking out from under a conical steel cap.  Twenty men, maybe twenty-five,  he said, breathless.  Milk Snakes or Moon Brothers, by my guess. They must have eyes out, m’lady… hidden watchers… they know we’re here.   Ser Rodrik Cassel was already ahorse, a longsword in hand. Mohor crouched behind a boulder, both hands on his iron-tipped spear, a dagger between his teeth.  You, singer,  Ser Willis Wode called out.  Help me with this breastplate.  Marillion sat frozen, clutching his woodharp, his face as pale as milk, but Tyrion’s man Morrec bounded quickly to his feet and moved to help the knight with his armor.  Tyrion kept his grip on Catelyn Stark.  You have no choice,  he told her.  Three of us, and a fourth man wasted guarding us… four men can be the difference between life and death up here.    Give me your word that you will put down your swords again after the fight is done.    My word?  The hoofbeats were louder now. Tyrion grinned crookedly.  Oh, that you have, my lady… on my honor as a Lannister.   For a moment he thought she would spit at him, but instead she snapped,  Arm them,  and as quick as that she was pulling away. Ser Rodrik tossed Jyck his sword and scabbard, and wheeled to meet the foe. Morrec helped himself to a bow and quiver, and went to one knee beside the road. He was a better archer than swordsman. And Bronn rode up to offer Tyrion a double-bladed axe.   I have never fought with an axe.  The weapon felt awkward and unfamiliar in his hands. It had a short haft, a heavy head, a nasty spike on top.   Pretend you’re splitting logs,  Bronn said, drawing his longsword from the scabbard across his back. He spat, and trotted off to form up beside Chiggen and Ser Rodrik. Ser Willis mounted up to join them, fumbling with his helmet, a metal pot with a thin slit for his eyes and a long black silk plume.   Logs don’t bleed,  Tyrion said to no one in particular. He felt naked without armor. He looked around for a rock and ran over to where Marillion was hiding.  Move over.    Go away!  the boy screamed back at him.  I’m a singer, I want no part of this fight!    What, lost your taste for adventure?  Tyrion kicked at the youth until he slid over, and not a moment too soon. A heartbeat later, the riders were on them.  There were no heralds, no banners, no horns nor drums, only the twang of bowstrings as Morrec and Lharys let fly, and suddenly the clansmen came thundering out of the dawn, lean dark men in boiled leather and mismatched armor, faces hidden behind barred halfhelms. In gloved hands were clutched all manner of weapons: longswords and lances and sharpened scythes, spiked clubs and daggers and heavy iron mauls. At their head rode a big man in a striped shadowskin cloak, armed with a two-handed greatsword.  Ser Rodrik shouted  Winterfell!  and rode to meet him, with Bronn and Chiggen beside him, screaming some wordless battle cry. Ser Willis Wode followed, swinging a spiked morningstar around his head.  Harrenhal! Harrenhal!  he sang. Tyrion felt a sudden urge to leap up, brandish his axe, and boom out,  Casterly Rock!  but the insanity passed quickly and he crouched down lower.  He heard the screams of frightened horses and the crash of metal on metal. Chiggen’s sword raked across the naked face of a mailed rider, and Bronn plunged through the clansmen like a whirlwind, cutting down foes right and left. Ser Rodrik hammered at the big man in the shadowskin cloak, their horses dancing round each other as they traded blow for blow. Jyck vaulted onto a horse and galloped bareback into the fray. Tyrion saw an arrow sprout from the throat of the man in the shadowskin cloak. When he opened his mouth to scream, only blood came out. By the time he fell, Ser Rodrik was fighting someone else.  Suddenly Marillion shrieked, covering his head with his woodharp as a horse leapt over their rock. Tyrion scrambled to his feet as the rider turned to come back at them, hefting a spiked maul. Tyrion swung his axe with both hands. The blade caught the charging horse in the throat with a meaty thunk, angling upward, and Tyrion almost lost his grip as the animal screamed and collapsed."
