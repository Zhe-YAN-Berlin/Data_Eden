Before  them rose Bree-hill barring the way,  a dark mass against misty  stars; and under  its western flank nestled a large village. Towards it they  now  hurried desiring only to find a fire,  and a door  between them and the  night.     ####-   Chapter 9. At the Sign of            The Prancing Pony       Bree was the chief village of  the Bree-land, a small inhabited region,  like an island in the empty  lands round about. Besides  Bree  itself, there  was Staddle on the  other side of the hill, Combe  in a deep valley a little  further eastward,  and  Archet  on  the  edge of  the Chetwood.  Lying round  Bree-hill and the  villages was a small country of fields and tamed woodland   only a few miles broad.       The Men of Bree were brown-haired, broad,  and  rather  short, cheerful  and independent: they belonged to  nobody but themselves; but they were more  friendly and familiar with Hobbits, Dwarves, Elves, and other inhabitants of  the world  about them than was (or  is)  usual with Big People. According to  their own tales  they were the original inhabitants and wer e the descendants  of the first Men that ever wandered  into the West of the  middle-world. Few  had survived the turmoils of  the Elder  Days; but  when the  Kings returned  again over the  Great Sea  they had found the Bree-men still there, and they  were st ill there now, when the memory  of  the  old Kings had faded into the  grass.       In those days no other Men had settled dwellings so far west, or within  a hundred leagues of the Shire. But in the wild lands beyond Bree there were  mysterious wanderers. The Bree-folk called them Rangers, and knew nothing  of  their origin. They  were  taller and darker  than the  Men of Bree  and were  believed  to have strange powers of sight and hearing, and to understand the  languages of beasts and birds. They roamed at will southwards, and eastwards  even as far as  the Misty  Mountains; but they were now few and rarely seen.  When  they appeared they brought news from afar, and told strange  forgotten  tales which were eagerly listened to; but the Bree-folk did not make friends  of them.       There were  also many families  of hobbits  in the  Bree-land  and they  claimed to be  the oldest  settlement of Hobbits in the world, one that  was  founded long before even the Brandywine was crossed and the Shire colonized.  They  lived  mostly  in  Staddle though  there were  some  in  Bree  itself,   especially on the  higher slopes of the hill, above the  houses of  the Men.   ####-The  Big  Folk and  the  Little Folk  (as they  called one another) were  on   friendly  terms,  minding their  own affairs in  their own  ways,  but  both  rightly regarding  themselves as  necessary parts of the Bree-folk.  Nowhere  else in the world was this peculiar (but excellent) arrangement to be found.       The Bree-folk, Big and Little, did  not themselves travel much; and the  affairs  of the  four villages  were their  chief concern. Occasionally  the  Hobbits  of Bree went as far as  Buckland, or the  Eastfarthing; but  though  their  link land  was not  much  further  than a  day's  riding  east of the  Brandywine Bridge,  the  Hobbits  of the Shire  now seldom  visited  it.  An  occasional Bucklander or  adventurous Took would come  out to  the Inn for a   night  or  two, but  even  that  was  becoming  less  and  less  usual.  The  Shire-hobbits referred to those of Bree, and to any others that lived beyond  the  borders,   as  Outsiders,  and  took  very  little  interest  in  them,  considering them dull  and uncouth. There were probably  many more  Outsiders  scattered about in the West  of the World in those days than  the  people of  the Shire imagined. Some, doubtless, were no  better than  tramps, ready  to   dig a hole in any bank and  stay only as long as it suited them.  But in the  Bree-land, at any rate, the hobbits were decent and  prosperous, and no more  rustic tha n most of their distant relatives Inside. It was not yet forgotten  that there had been a time when there was much coming and going  between  the  Shire and Bree. There was Bree-blood in the Brandybucks by all accounts.        The village of Bree had some  hundred  stone houses  of  the Big  Folk,  mostly above the Road, nestling  on the hillside with  windows looking west.  On that side, running in  more  than half a circle from the hill and back to  it, there was a deep dike with a thick hedge on the  inner side.   Over  this  the Road crossed by a causeway; but where it pierced the hedge it was barred  by a great gate. There was another gate in the southern comer where the Road  ran out of the village. The  gates were closed at nightfall; but just inside  them were small lodges for the gatekeepers.        Down on  the Road, where it swept to the right to  go round the foot of  the hill, there was a large inn."
