'It  is true that  I  wish to  go back to the Shire,' said Frodo.  'But  first I must  go to Rivendell.  For  if there could be anything wanting in a   time so  blessed,  I missed Bilbo;  and  I was  grieved when  among all  the  household of Elrond I saw that he was not come.'       'Do  you wonder at that,  Ring-bearer?' said  Arwen.  'For you know the  power  of that thing  which is now destroyed; and  all that was done by that  power is now passing away. But your kinsman possessed this thing longer than  you.  He is ancient in years now, according to his kind; and  he awaits you,  for he will not again make any long journey save one.'       'Then I beg leave to depart soon,' said Frodo.       'In seven days we will go,' said Aragorn. 'For we  shall ride  with you   far on the road, even as far as  the  country  of Rohan.  In three days  now  Jomer will return hither to bear Thjoden back to rest  in  the Mark, and  we  shall ride  with  him to honour  the fallen.  But now before  you go  I will  confirm the words that Faramir spoke to you, and you are made free  for ever  of the realm of Gondor; and  all your companions likewise. And if there were  any gifts that I could give to match with  your deeds you  should have them;   but whatever you  desire you  shall  take  with you, and  you shall ride  in  honour and arrayed as princes of the land.'       But the  Queen  Arwen  said:  'A  gift I will give  you.  For I  am the  daughter  of Elrond. I shall not  go  with  him now when  he departs to  the   ####-Havens; for mine is the choice of LÂ®thien, and as she so have I chosen, both  the  sweet  and the bitter. But in  my stead you shall go, Ring-bearer, when  the time  comes, and if you  then desire it. If your hurts grieve you  still  and the memory of  your  burden is heavy, then  you may pass  into the West,  until all your wounds and weariness  are hea led. But wear this now in memory  of Elfstone and Evenstar with whom your life has been woven!'       And she took  a white gem like a star that lay upon her  breast hanging  upon a silver chain,  and she  set the chain  about Frodo's neck.  'When the  memory  of the  fear  and  the darkness troubles you,'  she said, 'this will  bring you aid.'       In three days, as the King had said, Jomer  of Rohan came riding to the  City, and with him came an  jored of the fairest knights  of the Mark. He was  welcomed; and when they sat all  at table in Merethrond,  the  Great Hall of  Feasts, he beheld the beauty of  the ladies that he  saw and was filled with  great  wonder. And before  he went to his rest he sent for Gimli  the Dwarf,  and he said to him: 'Gimli Gluin's son, have you your axe ready?'       'Nay,  lord,' said Gimli, 'but  I  can  speedily fetch it, if there  be  need.'       'You  shall  judge,'  said  Jomer.  'For  there are  certain rash words  concerning the Lady in the Golden  Wood that lie still between us. And now I  have seen her with my eyes.'       'Well, lord,' said Gimli, 'and what say you now?'       'Alas!'  said Jomer. 'I will not say that she  is the fairest lady that  lives.'       'Then I must go for my axe,' said Gimli.       'But first I will  plead this excuse,' said Jomer. 'Had  I seen  her in  other company, I would have said all that you could wish. But now I will put  Queen Arwen Evenstar first, and I  am ready to do battle on my own part with  any who deny me. Shall I call for my sword?'       Then  Gimli bowed low.  'Nay, you are excused  for my  part, lord,'  he  said. 'You have chosen the Evening; but my love is given to the Morning. And  my heart forebodes that soon it will past away for ever.'       At last  the day of departure came, and a  great and fair  company made  ready to ride  north from the City. Then the kings of Gondor and Rohan  went  to the Hallows and they came  to the tombs in Rath Dnnen, and they bore away  King Thjoden upon  a golden  bier,  and passed through the City  in silence.   Then they laid the bier upon a great wain with  Riders of Rohan all about it   ####-and his banner borne before; and Merry being Thjoden's esquire rode upon the  wain and kept the arms of the king.       For  the  other  Companions steeds  were furnished  according to  their  stature; and Frodo and Samwise rode at Aragorn's side, and Gandalf rode upon  Shadowfax, and Pippin rode with the knights of Gondor; and Legolas and  Gimli  as ever rode together upon Arod.       In that riding went  also Queen  Arwen, and Celeborn and Galadriel with  their  folk,  and Elrond  and his sons; and the princes of Dol Amroth and of  Ithilien, and many captains and knights. Never had any king of the Mark such  company upon the road as went with Thjoden Thengel's  son to the land of his  home.       Without haste and at peace they passed into Anurien,  and they came  to  the  Grey  Wood under Amon  D(n; and  there they heard a sound  as  of drums  beating in the hills, though no living thing could be seen."
