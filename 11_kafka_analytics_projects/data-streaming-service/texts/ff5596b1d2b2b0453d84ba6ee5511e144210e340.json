'Denethor  has gone  to  the  Tombs,'  said Pippin, 'and  he has  taken  Faramir, and  he says we are all to burn, and he will not wait, and they are  to make a pyre and  burn him on it, and Faramir as well. And he has sent men  to fetch  wood and  oil.  And I have told Beregond, but I'm afraid  he won't   dare  to  leave his post: he is on  guard. And what can  he  do  anyway?' So  Pippin poured out  his tale, reaching up  and  touching  Gandalf's knee with  trembling hands. 'Can't you save Faramir?'       'Maybe I can,' said Gandalf;  'but  if  I do, then  others will die,  I  fear. Well, I must come, since no  other  help can  reach  him. But evil and  sorrow will come of this. Even in the heart of our stronghold the Enemy  has  power to strike us: for his will it is that is at work.'   ####-     Then  having made up  his mind he acted swiftly; and catching up Pippin  and setting him before him, he turned Shadowfax with a word. Up the climbing  streets of Minas  Tirith they clattered, while the noise of  war rose behind  them. Everywhere men were rising from their despair and dread, seizing their  weapons, crying  one to another: 'Rohan  has come!'  Captains were shouting,  companies were mustering; many already were marching down to the Gate.       They  met  the Prince Imrahil,  and  he called  to them: 'Whither  now,  Mithrandir?  The Rohirrim are  fighting  on  the  fields  of Gondor! We must   gather all the strength that we can find.'       'You will need every man and more,' said  Gandalf.  'Make  all haste. I  will come when I can. But I  have  an errand to the  Lord Denethor that will  not wait. Take command in the Lord's absence!'       They passed on; and  as they climbed and drew near to the Citadel  they  felt the wind blowing in their faces, and they caught the glimmer of morning   far away, a light growing in the southern sky. But it brought little hope to  them, not knowing what evil lay before them, fearing to come too late.       'Darkness is passing,' said Gandalf, 'but it still lies heavy  on  this  City.'       At the  gate  of the  Citadel they found no guard.  'Then Beregond  has  gone,' said  Pippin  more hopefully. They turned away and hastened along the  road to  the Closed Door. It stood wide open,  and the porter lay before it.  He was slain and his key had been taken.       'Work of the Enemy!' said Gandalf. 'Such  deeds he loves: friend at war  with friend; loyalty divided in  confusion of hearts.' Now he dismounted and  bade  Shadowfax return to his stable. 'For, my friend,' he said, 'you and  I  should have ridden to  the fields long  ago, but other matters delay me. Yet  come swiftly if I call!'       They passed the Door  and walked on down the steep winding  road. Light  was  growing, and the tall columns and carven  figures beside the  way  went  slowly by like grey ghosts.        Suddenly the silence was broken,  and  they  heard below them cries and   the ringing of swords: such  sounds as had not been  heard in  the  hallowed  places since the building of  the City. At  last they came to Rath Dnnen and  hastened towards the  House of the Stewards,  looming in the  twilight under   its great dome.       'Stay!  Stay!'  cried Gandalf,  springing  forward  to the stone  stair  before the door. 'Stay this madness!'   ####-     For there were  the servants of  Denethor with  swords and  torches  in  their hands; but  alone in the  porch upon  the topmost step stood Beregond,  clad in the black and silver of  the  Guard;  and he held  the door  against  them. Two of them had already fallen to his sword, staining the hallows with  their blood;  and the others cursed  him, calling him outlaw and  traitor to  his master.       Even  as Gandalf and  Pippin  ran forward,  they heard from  within the  house of the dead  the voice of Denethor crying: 'Haste, haste! Do as I have  bidden!  Slay me this renegade! Or must I do so myself?' Thereupon  the door   which Beregond held  shut  with  his left  hand was wrenched open, and there  behind him stood the Lord of the City, tall and fell; a light like flame was  in his eyes, a nd he held a drawn sword.       But Gandalf sprang up  the steps, and  the men fell  back from  him and  covered their eyes; for his  coming  was like the incoming of a  white light  into  a dark place, and he came with great anger. He lifted up his hand, and  in  the very stroke, the sword of Denethor flew  up and left  his  grasp and  fell  behind him in the shadows of the house; and  Denethor stepped backward  before Gandalf as one amazed.       'What is this, my lord?' said the wizard. 'The houses  of the  dead are  no  places for the living.  And why  do men  fight here in the  Hallows when  there  is  war enough before  the  Gate? Or has our  Enemy come even to Rath  Dnnen?'       'Since  when  has  the Lord  of  Gondor been answerable to thee?'  said  Denethor.  'Or may I not command my own servants?'       'You may,' said Gandalf."
