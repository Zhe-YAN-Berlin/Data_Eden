He came back at last to the  stone door of the  orc-passage, and  still  unable to  discover the catch  or bolt that held it,  he scrambled  over  as  before and dropped softly to  the ground. Then he made his way stealthily to  the  outlet of Shelob's tunnel, where the rags  of  her great web were still  blowing and swaying in the  cold airs. For cold they seemed to Sam after the   noisome darkness behind;  but the  breath of  them  revived  him.  He  crept  cautiously out.       All was ominously quiet.  The light was no more than that of dusk  at a   dark day's end. The vast vapours that  arose in  Mordor and  went  streaming  westward passed  low overhead,  a  great  welter of cloud and smoke now  lit  again beneath with a sullen glow of red.       Sam  looked up  towards the orc-tower, and  suddenly  from  its  narrow  windows lights stared out like small red eyes. He wondered if they were some  signal.  His fear  of  the orcs,  forgot ten  for  a  while  in his wrath and  desperation,  now returned. As  far  as he  could  see, there  was only  one  possible course  for him to take: he  must go on  and try to find  the  main  entrance to  the dreadful tower; but his knees  felt weak, and he  found that  he was trembling. Drawing his eyes  down from the tower and the horns of the  Cleft  before  him, he forced  his unwilling  feet  to obey him, and slowly,  listening  with all  his  ears, peering into the dense shadows of  the rocks  beside the way, he  retraced his steps, past the place where Frodo fell, and  still the  stench of Shelob lingered,  and  then  on  and up, until he stood  again in the very  cleft where  he had  put  on the Ring  and seen Shagrat's  company go by.       There he halted and sat down. For the moment he could drive himself  no  further. He  felt that if once he went beyond the crown of the pass and took   one  step  veritably  down  into the land  of  Mordor, that  step  would  be  irrevocable. He could never come back. Without a ny clear purpose he drew out  the  Ring  and put it  on again. Immediately he felt the great burden of its  weight, and  felt afresh,  but  now more  strong  and urgent than ever,  the   ####-malice of the Eye of Mordor, searching, trying to pierce the shadows that it  had made for its own defence, but which now  hindered it in its  unquiet and  doubt.       As before, Sam found  that his  hearing was sharpened, but  that to his  sight the things of this world seemed thin and vague. The rocky walls of the  path were pale , as if seen through  a mist, but still at a distance he heard  the bubbling of Shelob in her misery: and harsh and clear, and very close it  seemed, he  heard cries  and the clash of metal. He sprang to his  feet, and  pressed himself against the wall beside  the road. He was glad of the  Ring,  for here was  yet another company of orcs on  the  march. Or so  at first he  thought.  Then suddenly  he realized that  it  was not so,  his  hearing had  deceived him: the orc-cries came from the tower, whose topmost  horn was  now  right above him, on the left hand of the Cleft.       Sam shuddered and tried  to force  himself to  move.  There was plainly  some devilry going on. Perhaps in spite of all  orders  the  cruelty of  the  orcs  had mastered them, and  they were tormenting Frodo,  or  even savagely  hacking  him  to pieces. He listened; and as he did  a gleam of hope came to   him. There could  not  be much  doubt: there was fighting in  the tower, the  orcs  must be at war among themselves, Shagrat and Gorbag had come to  blows.  Faint as was the  hope that his  guess brought him, it  was enough to  rouse  him.  There might be just a  chance. His love for Frodo rose above all other   thoughts, and forgetting his peril he cried aloud: 'I'm coming, Mr. Frodo!'       He ran  forward to  the  climbing path, and  over it.  At once the road  turned left and plunged steeply down. Sam had crossed into Mordor.         He took off  the  Ring, moved  it may be  by some  deep premonition  of  danger,  though  to  himself he  thought  only that  he wished  to see  more  clearly. `Better have a look at the worst,' he muttered. `No good blundering  about in a fog!'       Hard and cruel and bitter  was the land  that met his gaze.  Before his  feet the highest ridge  of the Ephel DÂ®ath fell steeply in great cliffs down  into a  dark trough, on the further side  of which there rose another ridge,  much lower, its edge notched and jagged with crags like fangs that stood out  black  against the red light  behind them: it was the grim Morgai, the inner   ring of the fences  of  the land. Far  beyond it, but almost straight ahead,   ####-across a wide  lake  of darkness dotted  with  tiny fires, there was a great  burning glow; and from it rose  in huge columns a swirling smoke,  dusty red  at the  roots, black above  where it merged into the  billowing canopy  that  roofed in all the accursed land."
