I bid you come out  before your  doors  and look abroad.  Too  long have  you sat in  shadows and  trusted to  twisted tales and crooked promptings.'       Slowly  Thjoden left his  chair. A faint light  grew in the hall again.  The  woman hastened to  the king's side, taking his arm, and with  faltering  steps the old man came down from the dais and paced softly through the hall.  Wormtongue remained lying on the floor. They came to  the  doors and  Gandalf  knocked.       'Open!' he cried. 'The Lord of the Mark comes forth!'       The doors rolled  back  and a keen air  came whistling in.  A wind  was  blowing  on  the  hill.  'Send your guards down  to the stairs  foot,'  said  Gandalf. 'And you, lady, leave him a while with me. I will care for him.'       'Go, Jowyn sister -daughter!' said the  old king. 'The time for  fear is   ####-past.'       The woman turned  and went slowly into  the house. As  she  passed  the   doors  she turned and looked back. Grave  and thoughtful  was her glance, as  she looked on the king with cool  pity in her eyes. Very fair was  her face,  and her long hair was like a river of gold. Slender and tall  she was in her   white  robe girt with  silver; but strong she seemed and  stern as steel,  a   daughter of kings. Thus Aragorn for the first time in the  full light of day  beheld  Jowyn, Lady of Rohan, and thought her fair, fair  and cold,  like  a   morning of  pale spring that  is not yet come to womanhood. And she  now was  suddenly  aware  of  him:  tall  heir  of kings,  wise  with  many  winters,  greycloaked.  Hiding a power that yet she felt.  For a moment still as stone  she stood, then turning swiftly she was gone.       'Now, lord,' said Gandalf, 'look out upon  your land!  Breathe the free  air again!'       From  the porch upon the top  of the high terrace they could see beyond  the stream the green fields of Rohan fading  into distant grey.  Curtains of  wind-blown rain were slanting down. The sky above and  to the west was still  dark with thunder, and lightning far away flickered among the tops of hidden  hills. But the wind had shifted to the north, and already the storm that had  come  out of  the  East  was  receding, rolling away  southward to  the sea.  Suddenly through a rent  in  the clouds behind them a shaft  of sun  stabbed  down. The falling  showers  gleamed  like  silver,  and  far away the  river   glittered like a shimmering glass.       'It is not so dark here,' said Thjoden.       'No,' said Gandalf. 'Nor does age lie so  heavily on your  shoulders as  some would have you think. Cast aside your prop!'       From the  king's hand the black staff fell clattering on the stones. He  drew himself up, slowly, as a man  that is stiff from long bending over some  dull toil.  Now tall  and straight he stood,  and his  eyes were blue as  he  looked into the opening sky.       'Dark have  been  my  dreams  of late,' he said,  'but  I  feel as  one  new-awakened. I would now that you had come before, Gandalf. For I fear that  already  you have come  too late, only to see the last days of my house. Not  long now shall stand the high hall which Brego son of Eorl built. Fire shall  devour the high seat. What is to be done?'       'Much,' said Gandalf. 'But first send for Jomer. Do I not guess rightly  that  you hold him prisoner,  by the counsel of Grnma, of him that all  save   ####-you name the Wormtongue?'       'It is  true,' said Thjoden. 'He  had rebelled against my commands, and  threatened death to Grnma in my hall.'       'A man  may love you  and yet not love Wormtongue or his counsels' said  Gandalf.       'That may be. I will  do as you ask. Call  Hbma to  me. Since he proved  untrusty  as a  doorward, let him  become an errand -runner. The guilty shall   bring the guilty to judgement,' said Thjoden, and his voice was grim, yet he  looked  at  Gandalf and  smiled and  as  he did so many lines  of care  were  smoothed away and did not return.       When  Hbma  had  been  summoned and had  gone, Gandalf led Thjoden to  a  stone seat, and then sat  himself before  the  king upon  the topmost stair.  Aragorn and his companions stood nearby.       'There is no time to tell all that you should hear,' said Gandalf. 'Yet  if my  hope is not cheated, a time will come ere  long when I can speak more  fully. Behold! you  are  come into  a peril  greater  even  than the wit  of  Wormtongue could weave into your dreams. But see!  you  dream no longer.  You  live.  Gondor and  Rohan do not stand alone. The enemy  is strong beyond our  reckoning, yet we have a hope at which he has not guessed.'       Quickly now Gandalf spoke. His voice  was low and secret, and none save  the  king heard what he said. But  ever as he spoke the light shone brighter   in Thjoden's eye, and at  the last he rose from his seat to his full height,  and  Gandalf  beside him, and  together  they looked out from the high place  towards the East."
