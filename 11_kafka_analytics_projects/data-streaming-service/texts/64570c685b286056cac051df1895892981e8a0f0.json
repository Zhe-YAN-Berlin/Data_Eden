And there came Gandalf on  foot and with him one cloaked in grey; and they met before the doors of  the  Houses of Healing. And they greeted Gandalf and said: 'We  seek the Steward,  and men say that  he is in  this House.  Has any hurt befallen him? And  the  Lady Jowyn, where is she?'       And Gandalf answered: 'She lies  within and is not  dead, but  is  near  death. But the Lord Faramir was wounded by an evil dart,  as you have heard,  and he  is  now the Steward; for Denethor has departed, and his house is  in  ashes.' And they were filled with grief and wonder at the tale that he told.       But Imrahil  said: 'So victory is shorn of gladness,  and  it is bitter   bought, if both Gondor and Rohan are in one day bereft of their lords. Jomer   rules the Rohirrim. Who shall rule the City meanwhile? Shall we not send now  for the Lord Aragorn?'       And the cloaked man spoke and said:  'He is  come.' And they saw  as he  stepped  into the  light of  the lantern  by the  door that  it was Aragorn,   ####-wrapped in the grey cloak  of  Lurien above his mail, and bearing  no  other  token  than the green stone of Galadriel. 'I  have come because Gandalf begs  me  to do so,'  he  said. 'But for the present I am but the  Captain  of the  DÂ®nedain of Arnor;  and the Lord  of  Dol Amroth  shall rule the City  until   Faramir awakes. But it is my counsel that Gandalf should rule us  all in the  days  that follow and in our  dealings with the Enemy.' And they agreed upon  that.       Then Gandalf  said:  'Let us not  stay  at the door,  for the  time  is  urgent. Let us enter! For  it is only in the coming of Aragorn that any hope  remains for the sick that lie in the House. Thus spake Ioreth, wise-woman of   Gondor: The hands of the  king are  the hands of a healer, and  so shall the  rightful king be known .'       Then  Aragorn entered first and the  others followed. And there  at the  door were two guards in the  livery of the  Cita del: one tall, but the other   scarce the height of a boy; and when he saw them he cried  aloud in surprise  and joy.       'Strider! How splendid! Do you know, I guessed  it was you in the black   ships. But  they were all  shouting  corsairs and wouldn't listen to me. How  did you do it?'       Aragorn laughed, and took the hobbit by the hand. 'Well met indeed!' he  said. 'But there is not time yet for travellers' tales.'       But Imrahil said to Jomer: 'Is it  thus that we speak to our kings? Yet  maybe he will wear his crown in some other name!'       And Aragorn hearing  him,  turned and  said: 'Verily, for  in the  high  tongue of old I am Elessar, the Elfstone, and  Envinyatar, the Renewer': and   he lifted from his breast the green stone that lay there. 'But Strider shall  be the name of my house, if that be ever established.  In the high tongue it  will not  sound  so ill,  and  Telcontar I will be and all  the heirs  of my  body.'       And with that they passed into the House; and as  they went towards the  rooms  where the  sick were tended  Gandalf told of the deeds  of  Jowyn and  Meriadoc. 'For,' he said, 'long have I stood by them and at first they spoke  much in their dreaming, before they sank into  the deadly darkness. Also  it  is given to me to see many things  far off.'       Aragorn  went first to Faramir, and then to the Lady Jowyn, and last to  Merry. When  he had looked on the faces of the sick  and seen their hurts he  sighed. 'Here I must  put forth all such power and skill as is given to me,'   ####-he said.  'Would that Elrond were here, for he is the eldest of all our race,  and has the greater power.'       And Jomer seeing  that he was sorrowful and weary said: 'First you must   rest, surely, and at the least eat a little?'       But Aragorn answered: 'Nay, for these  three, and most soon for Faramir,   time is running out. All speed is needed.'       Then he called to Ioreth and he said: 'You have store  in this House of  the herbs of healing?'       'Yes, lord,' she answered; 'but not enough, I reckon, for all that will  need  them. But I am sure I  do  not know  where we shall find more; for all  things are amiss in these dreadful days, what with  fires and  burnings, and  the lads that run errands so few, and all the roads blocked. Why, it is days  out of count since ever a carrier came in from Lossarnach to the market! But  we do our best in this  House with what we have, as  I am sure your lordship  will know.'       'I will judge that when I see,' said Aragorn.  'One thing also is short  time for speech. Have you athelas?'       'I do not know,  I am  sure, lord,' she answered, 'at least not by that  name. I will go and ask of the herb-master; he knows all the old names.'       'It is also called kingsfoil,' said Aragorn; 'and maybe you  know it by  that name, for so the country-folk call it in these latter days.' 'Oh that!'  said Ioreth. 'Well, if your lordship had named it at first I could have told  you."
