Then Aragorn stooped and looked in her face, and it was indeed white as  a lily, cold as frost, and hard as graven stone.  But he bent and kissed her   on the brow, and called her softly, saying:       'Jowyn Jomund's daughter, awake! For your enemy has passed away!'       She did not stir,  but now she began again  to  breathe deeply, so that  her breast rose  and  fell  beneath the white linen of  the sheet. Once more  Aragorn bruised two leaves of athelas and cast them into steaming water; and  he laved her brow with it, and her right arm lying cold and nerveless on the  coverlet.       Then,  whether Aragorn had indeed some forgotten  power of Westernesse,  or whether it was but his words  of the Lady Jowyn that  wrought on them, as   ####-the sweet influence of the herb  stole about the chamber it seemed to  those  who stood by that a keen wind blew through the window, and it bore no scent,  but was an air wholly fresh  and  clean  and young, as if it had not  before  been  breathed  by any  living thing and came  new-made from snowy  mountains  high beneath a  dome of stars,  or from shores of silver far away  washed by  seas of foam.       'Awake, Jowyn, Lady of  Rohan!'  said  Aragor n again,  and he  took her  right hand in his and  felt it  warm with life returning. 'Awake! The shadow  is gone and all darkness is washed  clean!' Then he laid her hand in Jomer's  and  stepped  away. 'Call  her!' he said, and  he passed  silently  from the  chamber.       'Jowyn, Jowyn!' cried Jomer amid his tears. But she opened her eyes and   said: 'Jomer! What  joy is this? For they said that you were slain. Nay, but  that was only the dark voices in my dream. How long have I been dreaming?'       'Not long, my sister,' said Jomer. 'But think no more on it!'       ' I am  strangely weary,' she said. 'I must rest a little. But tell me,  what of the Lord of the Mark? Alas! Do not tell me that that was a dream for   I know that it was not. He is dead as he foresaw.'       'He is dead,' said Jomer, 'but he bade me say farewell to  Jowyn dearer   than daughter. He lies now in great honour in the Citadel of Gondor.'       'That is grievous,' she said. 'And yet  it  is  good beyond all  that I  dared hope in the dark  days, when it seemed that the House of Eorl was sunk  in honour less than  any shepherd's cot. And what of the king's esquire, the  Halfling? Jomer, you shall make him a knight  of  the Riddermark, for he  is  valiant!'       'He lies nearby  in this  House,  and I will go  to him,' said Gandalf.   'Jomer  shall stay here for a while. But do  not  speak  yet of  war or woe,  until you are made whole  again. Great gladness  it is to see you wake again   to health and hope, so valiant a lady!'       'To health?' said  Jowyn. 'It  may  be so. At  least  while there is an  empty saddle of some  fallen Rider that I can  fill, and there  are deeds to  do. But to hope? I do not know.'       Gandalf and Pippin came to Merry's room, and there  they found  Aragorn  standing by  the  bed.   'Poor  old Merry!' cried Pippin, and  he ran to  the  bedside, for it seemed to  him that  his friend looked worse, and a greyness  was in his face, as if a weight of years of sorrow  lay on him; and suddenly   ####-a fear seized Pippin that Merry would die.       'Do not be afraid,'  said Aragorn. 'I came in  time, and  I have called  him back. He  is weary now, and grieved, and  he has taken a hurt  like  the  Lady Jowyn, daring  to  smite  that deadly  thing. But  these  evils can  be  amended, so strong and gay a sp irit is in him. His grief he will not forget;  but it will not darken his heart, it will teach him wisdom.'       Then Aragorn laid his hand on Merry's head, and passing his hand gently   through the brown curls, he touched the eyelids, and called him by name. And  when  the fragrance  of athelas stole through the room, like  the  scent  of  orchards, and of heather in the sunshine full of bees, suddenly Merry awoke,   and he said:       'I am hungry. What is the time?'       'Past supper -time  now,' said Pippin; 'though I daresay  I could  bring  you something, if they will let me.'       'They will indeed,' said Gandalf. 'And anything else that this Rider of  Rohan  may desire, if it can be found in Minas Tirith, where  his name is in  honour.'       'Good!' said Merry.  'Then I  would  like supper first, and after that a   pipe.' At that his face clouded. 'No, not a pipe.  I don't think I'll  smoke  again.'       'Why not?' said Pippin.       'Well,' answered Merry slowly. 'He is dead. It  has brought it all back   to me.  He said he was sorry he  had never had a chance of talking herb-lore  with me. Almost the last thing he ever said. I shan't ever be able to  smoke  again without  thinking of  him, and  that day, Pippin, when he  rode up  to  Isengard and was so polite.'       'Smoke then, and  think of  him!' said  Aragorn.  'For he  was a gentle  heart and a great king and kept his oaths; and he rose out of the shadows to  a last fair  morning."
