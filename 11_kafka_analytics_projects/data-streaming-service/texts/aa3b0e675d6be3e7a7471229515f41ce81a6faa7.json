There are no folk like  hobbits  after all for a real good  talk. I am getting very  old, and I began to wonder if I should ever live to  see your chapters of  our story. Good night! I'll take a walk, I  think, and  look at the stars of Elbereth in the garden. Sleep well!'     ####-   Chapter 2. The Council of Elrond            Next day Frodo woke  early, feeling refreshed and well. He walked along   the terraces above  the  loud-flowing Bruinen and watched the pale, cool sun  rise  above the far  mountains, and shine  down. Slanting  through the  thin  silver mist;  the dew upon the  yellow leaves was glimmering, and  the woven  nets of  gossamer twinkled  on  every bush.  Sam  walked beside  him, saying  nothing.  but  sniffing the air, and looking every now and again with wonder   in his eyes at the great heights in the East. The snow was white upon  their  peaks.       On a seat cut  in  the  stone beside  a turn in the path they came upon  Gandalf and  Bilbo  deep in  talk. `Hullo!  Good morning!' said Bilbo. `Feel   ready for the  great council?'       `I feel ready  for anything,' answered Frodo. `But most of all I should  like to go walking  today and  explore the valley. I should like to get into  those pine-woods up there.' He pointed away far up the side of  Rivendell to   the north.       'You may  have  a chance later,' said Gandalf. `But we cannot  make any  plans yet. There is much to hear and decide today.'       Suddenly as they were talking a  single clear bell rang out.  `That  is  the warning bell for the Council of Elrond,' cr ied Gandalf. `Come along now!  Both you and Bilbo are wanted.'       Frodo and Bilbo followed the wizard quickly along the winding path back  to the  house; behind them, uninvited and for the moment forgotten,  trotted  Sam.       Gandalf  led them to the porch where  Frodo had found  his  friends the  evening before. The light of the clear autumn morning was now glowing in the  valley. The noise of bubbling  waters  came up  from the foaming  river -bed.  Birds were singing,  and a  wholesome  peace lay on the  land. To  Frodo his  dangerous flight, and  the rumours  of  the darkness growing  in  the  world  outside, already seemed only the memories of a troubled dream; but the faces  that were turned to meet them as they entered were grave.       Elrond was there, and  several others were seated in silence about him.  Frodo saw Glorfindel and Gluin;  and  in a corner alone Strider was sitting,  clad in  his old  travel -worn clothes again. Elrond drew Frodo to a seat  by   ####-his side, and presented him to the company, saying:       'Here, my friends is the hobbit, Frodo son of Drogo. Few have ever come  hither through greater peril or on an errand more urgent.'       He then  pointed  out  and named those whom Frodo  had  not met before.  There was a younger dwarf at Gluin's side: his son Gimli. Beside  Glorfindel   there were several other counsellors of Elrond's household, of  whom Erestor  was the chief; and with him was Galdor, an Elf  from the Grey Havens who had  come on an errand from Cnrdan the Shipwright. There  was also a  strange Elf  clad in green  and  brown,  Legolas, a messenger from his father, Thranduil,   the King of the  Elves of Northern Mirkwood. And seated a little apart was a   tall man with a fair and  noble face,  dark-haired and  grey-eyed, proud and  stern of glance.       He was cloaked and booted as if for a  journey on horseback; and indeed   though his garments were rich,  and his cloak was lined with  fur, they were  stained with long travel. He had a  collar of silver in which a single white  stone was set; his locks  were shorn about his shoulders.  On a  baldric  he  wore  a  great horn tipped with  silver that now was laid upon his knees. He  gazed at Frodo and Bilbo with sudden wonder.       `Here,' said Elrond,  turning  to Gandalf, `is Boromir, a man  from the  South. He arrived in the grey morning, and seeks for counsel. I  have bidden  him to be present, for here his questions will be answered.'       Not all that was  spoken and debated in the  Council need now  be told.  Much was said of events in  the  world outside, especially in the South, and  in  the wide lands east of the Mountains. Of these things Frodo  had already   heard many rumours; but the tale of Gluin was new to him, and when the dwarf  spoke he listened attentively. It appeared that amid the splendour  of their  works  of  hand  the  hearts of  the  Dwarves of  the  Lonely Mountain  were  troubled.       `It is now many years ago,' said Gluin, `that a shadow of disquiet fell  upon our people. Whence it came we did not at first perceive. Words began to  be whispered in secret-: it was said that we were hemmed in  a narrow place,  and  that greater wealth and splendour would be found in a wider world. Some  spoke of Moria: the mighty works of our fathers  that are called in  our own  tongue Khazad-dym; and they  declared that now at last  we had the power and  numbers to return."
