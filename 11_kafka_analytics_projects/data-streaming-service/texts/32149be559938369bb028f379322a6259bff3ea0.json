There was neither star  nor moon when  the Riders came  to the breach in   the Dike, where the stream from above passed out, and the road beside it ran  down from  the  Hornburg. The  rampart loomed suddenly  before  them, a high  shadow beyond a dark pit. As they rode up a sentinel challenged them.       'The Lord of the Mark rides  to Helm's Gate,' Jomer answered. 'I, Jomer    ####-son of Jomund, speak.'       'This  is good  tidings beyond hope,' said  the  sentinel. 'Hasten! The  enemy is on your heels.'       The host  passed  through the breach  and halted  on the sloping  sward  above. They now learned to their joy  that Erkenbrand  had left  many men to  hold Helm's Gate, and more had since escaped thither.       'Maybe, we have a thousand fit  to fight on foot,' said Gamling, an old  man, the leader of those that watched the Dike. 'But  most of them have seen  too many winters, as I have,  or too few, as my son's son here. What news of  Erkenbrand? Word came yesterday that he was retreating hither with all  that  is left of the best Riders of Westfold. But he has not come.'       'I fear that he will not come now,' said Jomer. 'Our scouts have gained  no news of him, and the enemy fills all the valley behind us.'       'I would that he had  escaped,'  said Thjoden. 'He was a mighty man. In  him lived again the  valour of Helm the Hammerhand.  But we cannot await  him  here. We must draw all our forces now behind the walls. Are you well stored?   We bring  little  provision,  for we  rode forth  to open  battle,  not to a   siege.'       'Behind us  in the caves  of the Deep  are  three  parts of the folk  of  Westfold, old and young, children and women,' said Gamling. 'But great store  of food, and many beasts and their fodder, have also been gathered there.'       'That is well,' said Jomer. 'They are burning or despoiling all that is  left in the vale.'       'If they come to  bargain for our goods at Helm's Gate, they will pay a   high price,' said Gamling.       The king and his Riders passed on. Before the causeway that crossed the   stream they dismounted. In a long file they led their horses up the ramp and  passed within the gates of the Hornburg. There they were welcomed again with  joy and renewed hope; for now there were men enough to man both the burg  and  the barrier wall.       Quickly  Jomer set his  men in readiness. The king and  the men of  his  household  were  in  the   Hornburg,  and  there  also  were   many  of  the   Westfold-men.  But on  the Deeping  Wall and its tower, and behind it, Jomer   arrayed most of  the strength that he had, for here the  defence seemed more  doubtful, if the assault were determined and in great force. The horses were   ####-led far up the Deep under such guard as could be spared.       The Deeping Wall was twenty feet high, and so thick that four men could   walk abreast along the top, sheltered by a parapet  over  which  only a tall   man could look. Here and there were clefts  in the  stone  through which men  could shoot. This battlement could be reached by a stair running down from a  door in the outer court of the Hornburg; three flights of steps led  also up  on to the wall  from the Deep  behind; but in front  it  was smooth, and the  great stones of it were set with such  skill that no foothold could be found  at their joints, and at the top they hung over like a sea -delved cliff.        Gimli  stood  leaning  against the breastwork upon the wall. Legolas sat  above on the parapet, fingering his bow, and peering out into the gloom.       'This  is more to my liking,' said the dwarf, stamping  on  the stones.   'Ever my heart rises as we draw near the mountains. There is good rock here.  This country has tough bones. I felt them in my feet as we came  up from the  dike. Give  me  a year and a hundred of my kin and I would make this a place  that armies would break upon like water.'       'I do not doubt  it,'  said Legolas.  'But you are a dwarf, and dwarves  are strange folk. I do not like this  place, and I shall like it no more  by  the light of  day.  But you  comfort me, Gimli, and I  am  glad  to have you   standing nigh with your stout legs and your hard axe. I wish there were more  of your kin among us. But even more would I give  for a hundred good archers  of Mirkwood. We shall need  them.  The Rohirrim have good bowmen after  their  fashion, but there are too few here, too few.'       'It is dark for archery,'  said  Gimli. 'Indeed it is  time  for sleep.  Sleep! I feel the need of it, as never  I thought any dwarf could. Riding is  tiring  work. Yet my axe is restless in my hand. Give  me a row of orc-necks  and room to swing and all weariness will fall from me!'       A  slow time  passed.  Far down  in  the valley  scattered  fires still  burned. The hosts of Isengard were  advancing in  silence now. Their torches  could be seen winding up the coomb in many lines."
