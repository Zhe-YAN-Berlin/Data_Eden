  "text": " In  the glens of the Morgai on the other  side  of the  valley low scrubby trees lurked and clung, coarse grey grass-tussocks fought   with the stones,  and withered mosses crawled on them; and  everywhere great  writhing, tangled brambles sprawled. Some  had  long stabbing  thorns,  some  hooked barbs that rent like knives. The sullen shrivelled leaves of  a  past   year  hung on  them,  grating  and  rattling  in  the  sad airs,  but  their  maggot-ridden buds were  only  just  opening. Flies,  dun or grey, or black,  marked like ores with a red  eye-shaped blotch, buzzed and stung;  and above  the briar-thickets clouds of hungry midges danced and reeled.       'Orc-gear's no  good,' said Sam, waving his  arms. 'I  wish I'd  got  an  orc's hide!'       At  last Frodo  could  go  no further.  They had  climbed  up  a narrow  shelving ravine, but  they still had a long way to go before they could even  come in sight of the last craggy ridge. 'I must rest  now, Sam, and sleep if  I can.' said Frodo.  He looked  about, but there seemed  nowhere even for an  animal to crawl into  in this  dismal  country.  At length,  tired out, they  slunk  under a  curtain  of brambles that hung  down  like a  mat over a low  rock-face.       There  they sat and  made such a meal as they could. Keeping  back  the  precious  lembas for the evil days ahead, they ate the half of what remained  in Sam's bag of Faramir's provision: some  dried fruit, and a small  slip of  cured meat; and they sipped some water. They  had drunk again from the pools  in the valley, but they were very, thirsty again. There was a bitter tang in  the air of Mordor  that dried the mouth. When Sam thought of water  even his  hopeful spirit quailed.  Beyond  the Morgai there was the dreadful plain  of  Gorgoroth to cross.        'Now  you go to  sleep first, Mr. Frodo,' he said.  'It's getting  dark  again. I reckon this day is nearly over.'       Frodo sighed and was  asleep almost before  the words were  spoken. Sam  struggled with his own weariness, and he took Frodo's hand; and there he sat  silent till deep night fell. Then at last, to keep himself awake, he crawled  from  the hiding-place and looked out. The land seemed full of creaking  and  cracking and sly noises, but there was  no  sound of  voice or  of foot. Far  above the  Ephel DÂ®ath  in the West  the night-sky  was still dim and  pale.   ####-There,  peeping among the cloud-wrack  above  a  dark  tor high  up  in  the  mountains, Sam saw a white star twinkle for  a while. The beauty of it smote   his heart, as he looked  up  out  of the forsaken land, and hope returned to  him. For like  a shaft, clear and cold, the thought pierced  him that in the  end the Shadow was  only a small and passing thing: there was light and high  beauty for ever beyond  its reach. His song in  the Tower had been  defiance  rather  than hope;  for  then he was thinking of himself. Now, for a moment,   his own fate,  and even his masters, ceased to trouble him. He crawled  back   into the  brambles and  laid  himself by Frodo's side ,  and putting away all  fear he cast himself into a deep untroubled sleep.       They woke  together, hand in  hand.  Sam was  almost fresh,  ready  for   another day; but Frodo sighed.  His sleep had been uneasy, full of dreams of  fire, and  waking  brought  him no comfort.  Still  his sleep  had not  been  without  all healing virtue: he was stronger, more able  to  bear his burden  one stage further. They did not know the time, nor how long  they had slept;   but after a morsel of food and a sip of water  they went  on up  the ravine,  until it ended in a sharp slope of screes and sliding stones. There the last   living things gave up their struggle; the tops of the Morgai were grassless,   bare, jagged, barren as a slate.       After much wandering and search they found a way that they could climb,  and with a last hundred feet  of clawing scramble they were up. They came to  a cleft between two dark crags, and passing through found  themselves on the  very edge of the last  fence of Mordor. Below them, at the  bottom of a fall  of  some fifteen hundred feet,  lay  the inner plain stretching away into  a   formless gloom beyond their sight. The wind  of the world blew now from  the  West, and  the great clouds  were lifted  high,  floating away eastward; but  still only a grey  light came to the dreary fields of Gorgoroth. There smokes  trailed on the ground and lurked in hollows, and fumes  leaked from fissures  in the earth.       Still far away, forty  miles  at least,  they  saw Mount Doom, its feet  founded in  ashen ruin, its huge cone rising  to  a great height,  where its  reeking  head was swathed in cloud. Its fires were now  dimmed, and it stood  in smouldering slumber, as threatening and  dangerous as a  sleeping  beast.   Behind it there hung a vast shadow, ominous as a thunder-cloud, the veils of  Barad-dyr  that was  reared far  way upon a long spur of the Ashen Mountains  thrust down from the North."
