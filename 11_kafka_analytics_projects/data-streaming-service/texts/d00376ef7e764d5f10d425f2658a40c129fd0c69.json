'I   will sleep now,' he said; and the  Elf led him to a bower beside Pippin, and  he threw himself upon a bed and fell at once into a dreamless slumber.     ####-   Chapter 4. A Short Cut to Mushrooms            In the morning Frodo woke refreshed. He was lying in  a bower made by a  living tree  with branches laced  and drooping to the ground; his bed was of  fern and grass,  deep and soft  and  strangely fragrant. The sun was shining  through  the fluttering leaves,  which were still green  upon the  tree.  He  jumped up and went out.       Sam  was  sitting  on the grass near the  edge  of the wood. Pippin was  standing studying the sky and weather. There was no sign of the Elves.        'They have left us fruit  and drink, and bread,' said Pippin. 'Come and  have your breakfast. The bread tastes almost as good as it did last night. I  did not want to leave you any, but Sam insisted.'       Frodo  sat  down  beside  Sam and began  to eat. 'Wha t is the  plan for   today?' asked Pippin.       'To  walk  to Bucklebury as  quickly as possible,'  answered Frodo, and  gave his attention to the food.       'Do you think  we shall see  anything  of  those Riders?' asked  Pippin  cheerfully. Under  the  morning  sun the prospect of seeing a whole troop of  them did not seem very alarming to him.       'Yes, probably,' said Frodo, not liking  the reminder. 'But  I  hope to  get across the river without their seeing us.'       'Did you find out anything about them from Gildor?'       'Not much  - only hints and riddles,' said Frodo evasively. 'Did you ask   about the sniffing?'       'We didn't discuss it,' said Frodo with his mouth full.       'You should have. I am sure it is very important.'       'In that case I am sure Gildor would have refused  to explain it,' said  Frodo sharply. 'And now leave me in peace  for a bit! I don't want to answer   a string of questions while I am eating. I want to think!'       'Good heavens!' said Pippin. 'At breakfast?' He walked away towards the  edge of the green.       From Frodo's mind the bright morning - treacherously bright, he thought   - had not banished the fear of pursuit; and he pondered the words of Gildor.  The merry voice of Pippin came to him. He was running  on the green turf and  singing.   ####-     'No!  I could  not!' he said  to  himself.  'It is one thing to take my  young friends walking over the Shire with me, until we are hungry and weary,  and food  and  bed are  sweet.  To  take them into exile,  where  hunger and  weariness may ha ve  no cure,  is quite another  - even if they are willing to  come. The inheritance  is mine  alone.  I don't think I  ought  even to take  Sam.' He looked at Sam Gamgee, and discovered that Sam was watching him.       'Well, Sam!' he said. 'What about it? I am leaving the Shire as soon as  ever I  can - in fact I  have made up my mind now not even to wait  a day at  Crickhollow, if it can be helped.'       'Very good, sir!'       'You still mean to come with me?'       'I do.'       'It  is going to be very dangerous, Sam. 'It is already dangerous. Most   likely neither of us will come back.'       'If you don't come back, sir, then I shan't, that's certain,' said Sam.  'Don't you leave him! they said to me. Leave him! I said. I never mean to. I  am  going  with  him, if   he climbs to the Moon,  and if  any of those Black  Rulers try to stop him, they'll have Sam Gamgee to reckon with, I said. They  laughed.'       'Who are they, and what are you talking about?'       'The  Elves, sir. We had some talk last night; and  they seemed to know  you were going away, so I didn't see the use of denying  it. Wonderful folk,  Elves, sir! Wonderful!'       'They are,' said Frodo.  'Do you like  them still,  now  you have had a   closer view?'       'They  seem a bit above my likes and dislikes,  so  to speak,' answered  Sam slowly. 'It don't seem to matter what I think about them. They are quite  different from what I expected - so old and young, and so gay and sad, as it  were.'       Frodo looked at Sam rather startled, half expecting to see some  outward  sign of the odd change that seemed  to have come  over him. It did not sound  like the voice of the old Sam Gamgee that he thought he  knew. But it looked  like the old  Sam Gamgee sitting  there, except that  his face was unusually  thoughtful.       'Do  you feel any  need to  leave the Shire now  - now that your wish to  see them has come true already?' he asked.       'Yes,  sir. I  don't  know how to  say it, but after last night  I feel   ####-different. I seem to see ahead, in a kind  of way.  I know  we are going  to  take a very long road, into darkness; but I know I can't turn back. It isn't   to see Elves now, nor dragons, nor mountains, that  I want  - I don't rightly  know what I  want: but I  have something to do before the end, and  it  lies  ahead, not  in the Shire. I must see it through, sir, if you understand me."
