'You  will be needed  here,  for other things  than war. Your  father loves you, Faramir, and will  remember it ere the end. Farewell!'       So now the Lord Faramir had gone  forth again, and had taken  with  him  such strength of men as were willing to go  or could be spared. On the walls  some gazed through the gloom towards the ruined city, and they wondered  what  chanced there, for nothing could be seen.  And others, as ever, looked north  and counted the leagues to Thjoden in Rohan. 'Will he come? Will he  remember   our old alliance?' they said.       'Yes, he will  come,'  said  Gandalf, 'even  if  he comes too late. But  think! At best the Red Arrow cannot have reached him more than two days  ago,  and the miles are long from Edoras.'       It was night again ere news came. A  man rode in  haste from the fords,  saying that a host had issued from Minas Morgul and was already drawing nigh  to Osgiliath; and it had been joined  by regiments from the South, Haradrim,  cruel and tall. 'And we have learned ' said the messenger, 'that  the  Black   Captain  leads  them once again,  and the fear of him  has passed before him  over the River.'       With those ill-boding words the third day closed since  Pippin came  to  Minas Tirith. Few went to rest, for small hope had any now that even Faramir  could hold the fords for long.       The next day,  though the darkness  had reached  its  full and grew  no  deeper, it weighed heavier  on men's  hearts, and a great dread was on them.   Ill  news came soon  again.  The  passage of  Anduin was won  by  the Enemy.  Faramir was retreating to the wall of  the Pelennor, rallying his men to the  Causeway Forts; but he was ten times outnumbered.   ####-     'If he wins back at all across the Pelennor, his enemies will be on his  heels,' said  the messenger. 'They have paid dear for the  crossing but less  dearly than we  hoped.  The plan has been well laid. It is now  seen that in  secret  they have long been building  floats and barges in great numbers  in  East  Osgiliath.  They  swarmed across  like  beetles.  But  it is the Black   Captain  that  defeats us. Few  will stand and abide even the  rumour of his  coming.  His own folk quail at him,  and they would  slay themselves  at his  bidding.'       'Then I am needed  there more than here,' said Gandalf, and rode off at  once,  and the glimmer  of him  faded soon  from  sight. And  all that night  Pippin alone and sleepless stood upon the wall and gazed eastward.       The bells  of  day had  scarcely  rung  out again,  a  mockery  in  the  unlightened dark, when  far  away he saw  fires spring up, across in the dim  spaces where the walls of the Pelennor stood. The  watchmen cried aloud, and  all men in the City stood to arms. Now ever and anon there was a  red flash,   and slowly through the heavy air dull rumbles could be heard.       'They have taken the wall!' men cried. 'They are blasting  breaches  in  it. They are coming!'       'Where  is Faramir?'  cried  Beregond in dismay.  'Say not  that he has  fallen!'       It was  Gandalf that  brought the  first  tidings.  With  a  handful of  horsemen he came in the middle morning, riding as escort to a line of wains.   They were filled with wounded men, all that could be sa ved from the wreck of  the Causeway Forts. At  once he went  to Denethor.  The Lord of the City sat  now in a high chamber above the Hall of the White Tower  with Pippin  at his  side;  and through  the dim windows, north and  south and east,  he bent his  dark eyes, as if to pierce the shadows of doom that  ringed him  round. Most   to the north  he looked, and would  pause at whiles to listen as  if by some  ancient art his ears might hear the thunder of hoofs on the plains far away.       'Is Faramir come?' he a sked.       'No,' said Gandalf.  'But he still  lived when I  left him. Yet  he  is  resolved  to stay  with the rearguard,  lest  the retreat over  the Pelennor   become a rout.  He may,  perhaps, hold  his men  together long enough, but I   doubt it.  He  is  pitted against a foe too great.  For one has come  that I  feared.'       'Not -  the  Dark  Lord?'  cried Pippin, forgetting  his place  in  his  terror.   ####-     Denethor laughed bitterly. 'Nay, not  yet, Master Peregrin! He will not  come save  only to triumph over me when all is  won. He uses  others as  his  weapons. So do  all great lords, if they  are wise,  Master Halfling. Or why  should I sit here in  my tower and think, and watch, and wait, spending even  my sons? For I can still wield a brand.'       He stood up and cast open his long black cloak, and behold! he was clad  in mail beneath,  and girt  with a  long sword, great-hilted in a sheath  of  black and silver. 'Thus have I walked, and thus  now  for many years  have I   slept,' he said, 'lest with age the body should grow soft and timid."
