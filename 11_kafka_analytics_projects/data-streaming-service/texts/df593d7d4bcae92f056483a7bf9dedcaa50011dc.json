  "text": " Frodo,' said Sam. 'We must take it and  chance our luck,  if there is  any  luck in  Mordor. We  might as  well give  ourselves up as wander  about any more,  or try  to go back. Our  food won't   last. We've got to make a dash for it!'       'All right, Sam,' said Frodo. 'Lead me! As long as  you've got any hope  left. Mine is gone. But I can't dash, Sam. I'll just plod along after you.'       'Before  you start  any more  plodding,  you need  sleep and food,  Mr.  Frodo. Come and take what you can get of them!'   ####-     He gave  Frodo  water  and an additional wafer of the  waybread, and he  made  a pillow of his cloak for his master's  head. Frodo  was too  weary to  debate the matter, and Sam did not tell  him that he had drunk the last drop  of  their water, and eaten Sam's share of the food as well as  his own. When  Frodo was asleep Sam bent over him and listened to his breathing and scanned  his  face. It  was  lined and thin, and yet in  sleep it looked  content and  unafraid. 'Well, here goes, Master!' Sam muttered  to himself. 'I'll have to  leave you for a bit  and trust to luck. Water we must have, or we'll  get no  further.'       Sam  crept  out,  and flitting  from  stone to  stone  with  more  than  hobbit-care, he went down to the water -course, and then followed it for some  way as it climbed  north, until he came to the rock -steps where long ago, no   doubt,  its spring had come gushing  down  in  a little  waterfall. All  now  seemed dry and silent; but refusing to despair Sam stooped and listened, and  to his  delight he caught the sound of  trickling. Clambering a few steps up  he found a tiny stream of dark water that came out  from the  hill -side  and  filled a  little bare pool,  from which again it spilled, and vanished  then  under the barren stones.       Sam tasted the water, and it seemed good enough. Then  he drank deeply,   refilled the  bottle,  and turned  to go back.  At that  moment he caught  a   glimpse of a black form or shadow flitting among the rocks away near Frodo's  hiding-place.  Biting  back  a cry, he leapt  down from the spring and  ran,  jumping from stone to stone. It was  a  wary creature, difficult to see, but  Sam had little doubt about it: he longed to get  his hands on its  neck. But  it heard him coming and  slipped quickly away.  Sam  thought he  saw a  last   fleeting  glimpse  of  it,  peering  back  over  the  edge  of the  eastward  precipice, before it ducked and disappeared.       'Well, luck did not let me  down,' muttered Sam,  'but that was a  near  thing! Isn't it enough  to have orcs by the  thousand  without that stinking  villain coming nosing round? I wish he had been  shot!' He sat down by Frodo  and did not rouse him; but he did not dare to  go to  sleep himself. At last   when he felt his eyes closing and knew that his struggle to keep awake could  not go on much longer, he wakened Frodo gently.       'That  Gollum's  about   again,  I'm  afraid,  Mr.  Frodo,'   he  said.  'Leastways, if  it wasn't  him, then there's two of him. I went away to find  some water and  spied  him nosing  round just as I  turned back. I reckon it  isn't safe  for us  both to sleep  together,  and begging your pardon, but I   ####-can't hold up my lids much longer.'       'Bless you, Sam!' said Frodo. 'Lie down  and take your pr oper turn! But  I'd rather have Gollum than orcs. At any rate he  won't give us away to them  - not unless he's caught himself.'       'But he might do a bit of robbery and murder on  his own,' growled Sam.   'Keep your eyes open,  Mr. Frodo! There's  a bottle full of water. Drink up.  We can fill it again when we go on.' With that Sam plunged into sleep.       Light was fading when  he  woke.  Frodo sat  propped  against  the rock   behind, but he  had fallen asleep. The water-bottle  was empty. There was no  sign of Gollum.       Mordor -dark  had returned, and the watch-fires on  the  heights  burned  fierce and red, when the hobbits  set out  again on the most dangerous stage  of all  their  journey.  They  went first  to  the  little  spring, and then  climbing warily up they  came to the road at the  point  where it swung east   towards  the Isenmouthe  twenty miles away. It was not a broad road, and  it   had  no wall  or parapet along the edge and as it ran on the sheer drop from  its brink became deeper and deeper. The hobbits could hear no movements, and  after listening for a while they set off eastward at a steady pace.       After doing some twelve miles, they halted. A short  way back the  road  had  bent a  little northward and  the stretch that they had passed over was  now screened  from  sight.  This proved  disastrous. They  rested  for  some  minutes and then went on; but they had not taken many steps when suddenly in  the stillness of  the  night they  heard the  sound that all along  they had  secretly dreaded: the   noise of marching feet. It was still some way  behind  them, but looking  back they could see  the twinkle of torches  coming round  the  bend less  than  a mile away,  and they  were moving fast: too fast for   Frodo to escape by flight along the road ahead."
