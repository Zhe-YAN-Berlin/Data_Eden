They seemed to have passed through some  arched  doorway into a black and empty space. There  was  a great draught of  warmer   air behind them, and before  them the darkness was cold on their faces. They  halted and crowded anxiously together.       Gandalf seemed pleased. `I chose the right way,'  he said.  `At  last we   ####-are  coming to the habitable parts, and I guess that we are not far now from  the eastern side. But we are  high up, a good deal higher than  the  Dimrill  Gate, unless I am mistaken. From the feeling of the air we must be in a wide  hall. I will now risk a little real light.'       He  raised his staff,  and for a  brief instant there was blaze  like a   flash  of lightning. Great shadows sprang up and fled, and for a second they   saw a vast roof  far above their heads upheld by many mighty pillars hewn of  stone. Before them and on either side stretched a huge empty hall; its black   walls, polished  and smooth  as  glass, flashed and glittered.  Three  other   entrances  they saw, dark black  arches: one straight before them eastwards,   and one on either side. Then the light went out.       `That  is all that I shall venture on for the  present,' said  Gandalf.  'There used to be great windows on the mountain-side, and shafts leading out  to the light in the upper reaches of the Mines. I think we have reached  them  now, but it is  night outside again, and we  cannot tell until morning. If I  am right, tomorrow we may  actually see  the morning peeping  in. But in the  meanwhile we had better go  no further. Let  us rest, if we can. Things have  gone well  so far, and the greater part of the dark road is over. But we are  not through yet, and it is a long way down to the  Gates  that open  on  the  world.'       The Company spent that night in the great cavernous hall, huddled close  together  in a corner  to escape  the draught:  there seemed  to be a steady  inflow of chill air through the eastern archway. All about them as  they lay  hung the darkness,  hollow and  immense,  and  they  were  oppressed by  the  loneliness and vastness of  the dolven halls and endlessly branching  stairs  and passages. The wildest imaginings  that dark rumour had ever suggested to  the hobbits fell altogether short of the actual dread and wonder of Moria.       `There must have been a mighty crowd of dwarves here at one time ' said  Sam; `and every one  of them busier  than badgers for five  hundred years to  make all this, and most in hard rock too! What did they do it all for?  They  didn't live in these darksome holes surely? '       `These are not holes,' said Gimli. `This is the great realm and city of  the Dwarrowdelf. And  of  old  it was  not  darksome, but  full of light and  splendour, as is still remembered in our songs.'       He rose  and standing in the dark he  began to  chant in a  deep voice,  while the echoes ran away into the roof.        The world was young, the mountains green,   ####-     No stain yet on the Moon was seen,       No words were laid on stream or stone       When Durin woke and walked alone.       He named the nameless hills and dells;       He drank from yet untasted wells;       He stooped and looked in Mirrormere,       And saw a crown of stars appear,       As gems upon a silver thread,       Above the shadow of his head.         The world was fair, the mountains tall,       In Elder Days before the fall       Of mighty kings in Nargothrond       And Gondolin, who now beyond       The Western Seas have passed away:       The world was fair in Durin's Day.         A king he was on carven throne       In many-pillared halls of stone       With golden roof and silver floor,       And runes of power upon the door.       The light of sun and star and moon        In shining lamps of crystal hewn        Undimmed by cloud or shade of night       There shone for ever fair and bright.         There hammer on the anvil smote,       There chisel clove, and graver wrote;       There forged was blade, and bound was hilt;       The delver mined, the mason built.       There beryl, pearl, and opal pale,       And metal wrought like fishes' mail,       Buckler and corslet, axe and sword,       And shining spears were laid in hoard.         Unwearied then were Durin's folk        Beneath the mountains music woke:   ####-     The harpers harped, the minstrels sang,       And at the gates the trumpets rang.         The world is grey, the mountains old,       The forge's fire is ashen-cold        No harp is wrung, no hammer falls:       The darkness dwells in Durin's halls       The shadow lies upon his tomb       In Moria, in Khazad-dym.       But still the sunken stars appear       In dark and windless Mirrormere;       There lies his crown in water deep,       Till Durin wakes again from sleep."
