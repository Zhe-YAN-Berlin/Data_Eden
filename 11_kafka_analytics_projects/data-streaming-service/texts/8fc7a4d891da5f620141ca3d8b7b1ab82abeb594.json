  "text": " \"He really knows me now, watch. Norbert! Norbert! Where's Mommy?\"  \"He's lost his marbles,\" Ron muttered in Harry's ear.  \"Hagrid,\" said Harry loudly, \"give it two weeks and Norbert's going to be as long as your house. Malfoy could go to Dumbledore at any moment.\"  Hagrid bit his lip.  \"I -- I know I can't keep him forever, but I can't jus' dump him, I can't.\"  Harry suddenly turned to Ron. Charlie, he said.  \"You're losing it, too,\" said Ron. \"I'm Ron, remember?\"  \"No -- Charlie -- your brother, Charlie. In Romania. Studying dragons. We could send Norbert to him. Charlie can take care of him and then put him back in the wild!\"  \"Brilliant!\" said Ron. \"How about it, Hagrid?\"  And in the end, Hagrid agreed that they could send -an owl to Charlie to ask him.  The following week dragged by. Wednesday night found Hermione and Harry sitting alone in the common room, long after everyone else had gone to bed. The clock on the wall had just  chimed midnight when the portrait hole burst open. Ron appeared out of nowhere as he pulled off Harry's invisibility cloak. He had been down at Hagrid's hut, helping him feed Norbert, who was now eating dead rats by the crate.  \"It bit me!\" he said, showing them his hand, which was wrapped in a bloody handkerchief. \"I'm not going to be able to hold a quill for a week. I tell you, that dragon's the most horrible animal I've ever met, but the way Hagrid goes on about it, you'd think it was a fluffy little bunny rabbit. When it bit me he told me off for frightening it. And when I left, he was singing it a lullaby.\"  There was a tap on the dark window.  \"It's Hedwig!\" said Harry, hurrying to let her in. \"She'll have Charlie's answer!\"  The three of them put their heads together to read the note.  Dear Ron,  How are you? Thanks for the letter -- I'd be glad to take the Norwegian Ridgeback, but it won't be easy getting him here. I think the best thing will be to send him over with some friends of mine who are coming to visit me next week. Trouble is, they mustn't be seen carrying an illegal dragon.  Could you get the Ridgeback up the tallest tower at midnight on Saturday? They can meet you there and take him away while it's still dark.  Send me an answer as soon as possible.  Love,  Charlie  They looked at one another.  \"We've got the invisibility cloak,\" said Harry. \"It shouldn't be too difficult -- I think the cloaks big enough to cover two of us and Norbert.\"  It was a mark of how bad the last week had been that the other two agreed with him. Anything to get rid of Norbert -- and Malfoy.  There was a hitch. By the next morning, Ron's bitten hand had swollen to twice its usual size. He didn't know whether it was safe to go to Madam Pomfrey -- would she recognize a dragon bite? By the afternoon, though, he had no choice. The cut had turned a nasty shade of green. It looked as if Norbert's fangs were poisonous.  Harry and Hermione rushed up to the hospital wing at the end of the day to find Ron in a terrible state in bed.  \"It's not just my hand,\" he whispered, \"although that feels like it's about to fall off. Malfoy told Madam Pomfrey he wanted to borrow one of my books so he could come and have a good laugh at me. He kept threatening to tell her what really bit me -- I've told her it was a dog, but I don't think she believes me -I shouldn't have hit him at the Quidditch match, that's why he's doing this.\"  Harry and Hermione tried to calm Ron down.  \"It'll all be over at midnight on Saturday,\" said Hermione, but this didn't soothe Ron at all. On the contrary, he sat bolt upright and broke into a sweat.  \"Midnight on Saturday!\" he said in a hoarse voice. \"Oh no oh no -- I've just remembered -- Charlie's letter was in that book Malfoy took, he's going to know we're getting rid of Norbert.\"  Harry and Hermione didn't get a chance to answer. Madam Pomfrey came over at that moment and made them leave, saying Ron needed sleep.  \"It's too late to change the plan now,\" Harry told Hermione. \"We haven't got time to send Charlie another owl, and this could be our only chance to get rid of Norbert. We'll have to risk it. And we have got the invisibility cloak, Malfoy doesn't know about that.\"  They found Fang, the boarhound, sitting outside with a bandaged tail when they went to tell Hagrid, who opened a window to talk to them.  \"I won't let you in,\" he puffed. \"Norbert's at a tricky stage -- nothin' I can't handle.\"  When they told him about Charlie's letter, his eyes filled with tears, although that might have been because Norbert had just bitten him on the leg.  \"Aargh! It's all right, he only got my boot -- jus' playin' -- he's only a baby, after all.\"  The baby banged its tail on the wall, making the windows rattle. Harry and Hermione walked back to the castle feeling Saturday couldn't come quickly enough.  They would have felt sorry for Hagrid when the time came for him to say good-bye to Norbert if they hadn't been so worried about what they had to do. It was a very dark, cloudy night, and they were a bit late arriving at Hagrid's hut because they'd had to wait for Peeves to get out of their way in the entrance hall, where he'd been playing tennis against the wall."
