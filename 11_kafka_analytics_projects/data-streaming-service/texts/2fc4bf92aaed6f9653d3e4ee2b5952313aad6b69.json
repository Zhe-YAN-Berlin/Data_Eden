The beams  of it entered into her wounded head  and scored it with unbearable pain, and  the  dreadful  infection of light  spread  from  eye to  eye. She  fell back   beating  the air with her  forelegs, her   sight blasted by inner lightnings,   her  mind  in agony. Then turning her maimed head away, she rolled aside and  began to crawl, claw by claw, towards the opening in the dark cliff behind.       Sam came  on. He was reeling like a drunken man,  but he came  on.  And  Shelob cowed at last, shrunken in defeat, jerked and quivered  as she  tried  to  hasten from him. She  reached  the hole,  and  squeezing down, leaving a   trail of green-yellow slime, she slipped in, even as Sam hewed a last stroke  at her dragging legs. Then he fell to the ground.       Shelob was  gone; and  whether she lay  long in her  lair, nursing  her   malice  and her misery, and  in slow years of darkness  healed  herself from  within, rebuilding her clustered eyes, until with hunger like death she spun  once more her dreadful snares in the glens of the Mountains of  Shadow, this  tale does not tell.       Sam was left alone. Wearily, as the evening  of the Nameless Land  fell  upon the place of battle, he crawled back to his master.       'Master, dear master,' he said, but Frodo did not  speak. As he had run  forward, eager, rejoicing  to be  free,  Shelob  with hideous speed had come  behind and with one swift stroke had stung him in the neck. He lay now pale,  and heard no voice. and did not move.       `Master, dear  master! ' said Sam, and through  a long  silence waited.   ####-listening in vain.       Then as quickly as he could he  cut away the binding cords and laid his  head upon  Frodo's  breast and to his mouth, but  no stir of life  could  he  find, nor  feel  the  faintest flutter of  the  heart. Often  he chafed  his  master's hands and feet, and touched his brow, but all were cold.       `Frodo, Mr. Frodo! ' he called. 'Don't leave me here alone!  It's  your  Sam calling. Don't go  where I can't follow! Wake up, Mr. Frodo!  O wake up,  Frodo, me dear, me dear. Wake up!'       Then anger surged over hint,  and he ran  about his master's body in  a   rage,  stabbing the air,  and smiting the  stones, and shouting  challenges.   Presently he came back, and bending looked at Frodo's face, pale beneath him  in the  dusk.  And  suddenly  he  saw that he was  in the  picture  that was  revealed to him in the mirror of Galadriel in Lurien: Frodo with a pale face  lying fast asleep under  a great  dark cliff. Or fast asleep he had  thought  then. `He's dead! ' he said. 'Not asleep, dead! ' And  as he  said it, as if  the words had set the venom to its work again. it seemed to him that the hue  of the face grew livid green.       And  then black despair came down  on him, and Sam bowed to the ground,  and drew his grey hood over his head, and night came into  his heart, and he  knew no more.       When at last the blackness passed, Sam looked up and shadows were about  him; but for how many  minutes or  hours the world had  gone dragging on  he  could not  tell. He was still in  the  same place,  and still his master lay  beside him dead. The mountains had not crumbled  nor  the earth fallen  into  ruin.       'What shall I do, what shall I do? ' he said.  `Did I come all this way  with h im for  nothing? ' And then he remembered his own voice speaking  words  that at the time he  did not  understand  himself, at the beginning of their  journey: I have something to do before the end. I must see  it through, sir,  if you understand .       `But what can I do? Not leave  Mr. Frodo dead, unburied on  the  top of  the mountains, and go home? Or go on? Go on?' he repeated, and for  a  moment  doubt and fear  shook him. `Go on?  Is  that what I've  got to do? And leave  him?'       Then at last he began to weep; and going to Frodo he composed his body,   ####-and folded his cold hands upon his breast,  and wrapped his cloak about him;  and he laid  his own sword at one side, and the staff that Faramir had given  at the other.       'If I'm  to  go on,' he  said,  `then  I must take your sword,  by your  leave, Mr. Frodo, but I'll put this one to lie by you, as it lay by the  old  king in the barrow; and you've got your beautiful mithril coat from  old Mr.  Bilbo. And  your star-glass, Mr. Frodo, you did lend it to me and I'll  need  it, for I'll be  always in the dark now. It's too good  for me, and the Lady  gave it  to you, but maybe she'd understand. Do  you  understand, Mr. Frodo?  I've got to go on.'       But he could not  go, not yet. He knelt and held Frodo's hand and could  not release it. And time went  by and  still he knelt, holding  his master's  hand, and in his heart keeping a debate.       Now he tried to find strength to tear himself  away and go  on a lonely  journey -- for vengeance. If once he could go, his anger  would bear him down  all the roads of the world, pursuing, until he had him at last: Gollum."
