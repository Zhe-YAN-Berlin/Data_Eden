Radagast is, of course, a  worthy  Wizard, a master of  shapes and changes  of hue;  and he has much  lore of herbs  and beasts, and   ####-birds are especially  his friends. But Saruman  has long studied the arts of  the Enemy himself, and thus we have often been able to forestall him. It was  by the devices of Saruman  that we drove him  from Dol  Guldur. It might  be  that he had found some weapons that would drive back the Nine.       ' \"I will go to Saruman,\" I sa id.       ' \"Then  you must go  now,\" said  Radagast; \"for I have  wasted time in  looking  for you,  and  the  days  are running short. I was told to find you   before Midsummer, and that is now  here. Even if you set out from this spot,  you will hardly  reach him before the Nine discover the land that they seek.  I myself  shall turn back at  once.\" And with that he mounted and would have  ridden straight off.        ` \"Stay a  moment! \" I said. \"We shall  need your help, and the help of  all things that will give it. Send out messages  to all the beasts and birds  that are  your friends.  Tell them to bring news  of anything that bears  on  this matter to Saruman and Gandalf. Let messages be sent to Orthanc.\"       `  \"I will do  that,\"  he said, and rode off  as if  the Nine were after   him.       `I could not follow him then and  there. I had ridden  very far already  that day, and I was as weary as my horse;  and I needed to consider matters.   I stayed the  night in Bree, and decided that I had no time to return to the  Shire. Never did I make a greater mistake!        `However,  I wrote a message  to Frodo,  and trusted  to  my friend the  innkeeper to send it to him. I rode away at dawn; and I came at long last to  the dwelling of Saruman. That is far south in Isengard,  in  the  end  of the  Misty  Mountains,  not far  from the Gap of Rohan. And Boromir will tell you   that that is a great open vale that lies between the Misty Mountains and the  northmost  foothills  of Ered  Nimrais, the White Mountains of his home. But  Isengard is a  circle of  sheer rocks that enclose a valley as with  a wall,  and in the midst of that valley is a tower of  stone called Orthanc.  It was  not made by Saruman, but by the Men of NÂ®menor long ago; and it is very tall  and has many secrets; yet  it looks not to be  a work of craft. It cannot be  reached save  by passing the circle of Isengard; and in that circle there is  only one gate.       'Late one evening I came to the gate, like a great arch  in the wall of  rock; and it was strongly guarded. But the  keepers of the  gate  were on the  watch for me and told me that Saruman awaited me. I rode under the arch, and  the gate closed silently behind me, and suddenly I was afraid, though I knew   ####-no reason for it.       'But  I rode to the foot of Orthanc,  and came to the stair  of Saruman  and there he met me and led me up to his high chamber. He wore a ring on his  finger.       `  \"So you have come, Gandalf,\" he said to me gravely; but in  his eyes  there seemed to be a white light, as if a cold laughter was in his heart.       ` \"Yes, I have come,\" I said. \"I have  come  for your  aid, Saruman the  White.\" And that title seemed to anger him.       '  \"Have  you indeed, Gandalf the Grey! \" he scoffed.  \"For aid? It has  seldom been  heard of that  Gandalf the Grey sought for  aid, one so cunning   and  so wise, wandering about  the lands,  and concerning  himself in  every  business, whether it belongs to him or not.\"       'I looked  at him and wondered.  \"But if I am  not deceived,\"  said  I,  \"things are now moving which will require the union of all our strength.\"       ' \"That may be so,\" he said, \"but the thought is late in coming to you.  How long. I wonder, have  you concealed  from me, the head of the Council, a   matter  of greatest  import? What brings you now from your lurking-place  in  the Shire? \"       ' \"The Nine have come forth again,\" I answered. \"They have crossed  the  River. So Radagast said to me.\"       ` \"Radagast  the Brown! \" laughed  Saruman, and  he no longer concealed  his scorn. \"Radagast the Bird-tamer! Radagast the Simple! Radagast the Fool!  Yet he had just the wit to play the part  that I set him. For you have come,  and that was all the purpose of my message. And here you will stay,  Gandalf  the Grey,  and rest  from  journeys.  For  I  am  Saruman the Wise,  Saruman  Ring-maker, Saruman of Many Colours! \"       'I looked then and saw that his robes, which had seemed white, were not  so, but  were woven of  all  colours.  and  if  he moved they shimmered  and  changed hue so that the eye was bewildered.       ' \"I liked white better,\" I said.       ' \"White! \"  he sneered. \"It serves as a beginning. White  cloth may be  dyed. The white page can be overwritten; and the white light can be broken.\"       ' \"In which case it is  no longer white,\" said I. \"And he that breaks a   thing to find out what it is has left the path of wisdom."
