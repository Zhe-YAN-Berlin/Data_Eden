  "text": " They are  gone. They sought the Havens long ago.'       That morning they lit a fire in a deep  hollow shrouded by great bushes  of holly, and their supper -breakfast was merrier than it had been since they  set out. They did not hurry to bed afterwards, for they expected to have all  the  night  to sleep  in, and they  did not  mean to go  on again until  the  evening of the next day. Only Aragorn was silent and restless. After a while  he left the Company  and  wandered on  to the ridge; there he stood  in  the  shadow of a tree, looking out southwards and  westwards, with his head posed  as if he was listening. Then he returned to the brink of the dell and look ed  down at the others laughing and talking.       `What  is the  matter, Strider?' Merry called up. 'What are you looking  for? Do you miss the East Wind?'       'No  indeed,' he answered. `But I miss  something. I  have been in  the  country  of  Hollin in many seasons. No folk  dwell here now, but many other   creatures live here at  all times, especially birds. Yet now all  things but  you are silent. I  can feel it.  There is no sound for miles about  us,  and  your voices seem to make the ground echo. I do not understand it.'       Gandalf looked  up with  sudden interest. `But what do you guess is the  reason?' he asked.  `Is  there  more  in  it  than  surprise  at seeing four  hobbits, not to mention  the rest of us, where people are so seldom seen  or   heard?'       `I  hope  that  is  it,'  answered Aragorn.  `But I  have  a  sense  of  watchfulness, and of fear, that I have never had here before.'       \"Then we  must be more careful,' said Gandalf.  'If you bring a  Ranger   with you, it  is well  to pay attention to  him, especially if the Ranger is  Aragorn. We must stop talking aloud, rest quietly, and set the watch.'       It was Sam's turn that day  to take the first watch, but Aragorn joined  him. The others  fell asleep. Then the silence grew until even  Sam felt it.  The breathing  of  the  sleepers could be  plainly heard.  The swish  of the  pony's tail and the occasional movements of his feet became loud noises. Sam  could hear his own joints creaking, if  he  stirred. Dead silence was around   ####-him, and  over all  hung a  clear blue sky, as the Sun rode up from the East.  Away  in the South  a dark patch appeared,  and grew,  and  drove north like  flying smoke in the wind.       `What's  that, Strider? It don't look  like  a  cloud,' said  Sam  in a   whisper to  Aragorn. He made no  answer, he was gazing  intently at the sky;  but  before long  Sam could see for himself what was  approaching. Flocks of  birds, flying at great speed, were wheeling and circling, and traversing all  the  land as if they  were searching for  something; and they  were steadily  drawing nearer.       `Lie  flat and still!' hissed  Aragorn, pulling Sam down into the shade  of a holly-bush; for a whole regiment of birds had broken away suddenly from  the main host, and came, flying low, straight towards the ridge. Sam thought  they were a kind of crow of large size. As they passed overhead, in so dense  a throng that their shadow followed them  darkly over the  ground below, one  harsh croak was heard.       Not until they had  dwindled into the distance, north and west, and the  sky was again  clear  would  Aragorn rise. Then he  sprang  up and  went and  wakened Gandalf.       `Regiments of  black  crows  are  flying over all  the land between the  Mountains  and the Greyflood,'  he said, `and  they have passed over Hollin.   They are not natives here; they are crebain  out of Fangorn and Dunland. I do  not know what they are about: possibly there is some trouble away south from  which they are  fleeing; but  I  think  they are spying out the land. I have  also glimpsed many hawks flying high up in the sky. I think we ought to move  again this  evening.  Hollin is no  longer wholesome  for  us: it  is  being  watched.'       `And in that case so is the Redhorn  Gate,' said Gandalf;  `and how  we  can get over that withou t being seen, I cannot imagine. But we will think of  that when we must. As for moving as soon as it is dark, I am afraid that you   are right.'       `Luckily our fire made  little smoke,  and  had  burned  low before the  crebain  came,' said Aragorn. `It must be put out and not lit again.'       `Well if that isn't a plague and a nuisance!' said Pippin. The news: no  fire, and a move again  by night, had been broken to him, as soon as he woke  in the late afternoon. 'All because of a pack of crows! I had looked forward  to a real good meal tonight: something hot.'       `Well, you can go on looking forward,' said Gandalf. `There may be many   ####-unexpected feasts ahead for you. For myself I should like a pipe to smoke in  comfort,  and warmer feet. However, we are certain of one thing at any rate:  it will get warmer as we get south.'       'Too  warm, I  shouldn't  wonder,'  muttered  Sam  to  Frodo. 'But  I'm  beginning to think it's time we got  a sight of that Fiery Mountain  and saw  the end of the Road, so to speak."
