Over  it  a trickling water  dripped, through a wide cleft that  seemed to have been carved out by a fall that had once been  strong and full.        `Indeed things have changed! ' said Gandalf. `But there is no mistaking  the  place.  There  is  all  that remains of the  Stair Falls. If I remember   right, there was  a flight of steps cut  in the  rock at their side, but the  main road  wound away left and climbed with several  loops  up  to the level  ground at  the top. There used to be a shallow valley beyond the falls right  up to the Walls of  Moria, and the Sirannon flowed  through it with the road  beside it. Let us go and see what things are like now! '       They found the stone steps without difficulty, and Gimli sprang swiftly  up them,  followed by Gandalf and Frodo.  When they reached the top they saw  that  they could go no further that way, and the reason for the drying up of  the Gate-stream was revealed. Behind  them the sinking Sun filled  the  cool   western sky with glimmering  gold. Before them stretched a dark still  lake.  Neither sky nor sunset was reflected on its sullen surface. The Sirannon had  been dammed  and had filled  all the valley.  Beyond the  ominous water were  reared vast cliffs, their stern faces pallid in  the fading light: final and  impassable. No sign of gate or entrance,  not a fissure or crack could Frodo  see in the frowning stone.       `There  are  the  Walls  of  Moria,' said Gandalf,  pointing across the  water. `And there the Gate stood once upon a time, the Elven Door at the end  of the road from Hollin by which we have come. But this way is blocked. None  of  the Company, I guess, will wish to swim this  gloomy water at the end  of  the day. It has an unwholesome look.'       `We  must find a way round the northern  edge,' said Gimli. `The  first   thing for the  Company to  do is to climb up  by the main path and see where  that  will lead us.  Even  if  there were  no  lake,  we could not  get  our  baggage-pony up this stair.'       `But in any  case we cannot take the poor  beast  into the Mines,' said  Gandalf. `The road under the mountains is a dark road, and there are  places  narrow and steep which he cannot tread, even if we can.'       `Poor old Bill! ' said Frodo. `I had not thought of that. And poor Sam!   I wonder what he will say?  '       `I am sorry,' said Gandalf. `Poor Bill has  been a useful companion and  it goes  to  my heart to turn him adrift now. I would have travelled lighter    ####-and brought no animal, least of  all  this one that Sam is fond of, if I had  had my way. I feared all along that we should be obliged to take this road.'       The day was drawing to its end, and cold stars were glinting in the sky  high above the sunset, when the  Company,  with all  the speed  they  could,   climbed up the slopes and reached the side of the lake. In breadth it looked  to be no  more  than two or three furlongs at the widest point.  How far  it  stretched  away  southward they could  not see in the failing light; but its  northern end was no more than half a mile from where they stood, and between  the  stony ridges  that enclosed the valley and the water's edge there was a   rim of open ground. They hurried forward, for they had still  a mile  or two  to go  before they could reach the point on the  far shore that  Gandalf was  making for; and then he had still to find the doors.       When  they came to the northernmost corner of  the  lake  they  found a   narrow creek that  barred their way. It was green and stagnant,  thrust  out  like  a  slimy  arm  towards  the  enclosing  hills.  Gimli  strode  forward  undeterred, and found that the water was shallow, no more than ankle-deep at  the edge. Behind him they walked in file, threading their way with care, for   under  the  weedy  pools were sliding  and  greasy  stones, and footing  was  treacherous. Frodo shuddered  with disgust at  the touch of the dark unclean  water on his feet.       As  Sam,  the last of the Company, led Bill up  on to the dry ground on  the  far side, there came a soft sound: a swish, followed by a plop, as if a   fish had disturbed the still surface of  the water. Turning quickly they saw  ripples, black -edged  with shadow in  the  waning  light: great  rings  were  widening outwards from  a point far out in the lake.  There  was  a bubbling   noise, and then silence.  The  dusk  deepened, and  the  last gleams of  the  sunset were veiled in cloud.       Gandalf  now  pressed on  at  a great pace, and the  others followed as  quickly as they could. They reached the strip of dry  land between  the lake  and the cliffs: it  was  narrow,  often  hardly  a  dozen yards  across, and  encumbered  with fallen  rock  and stones; but they found a way, hugging the  cliff,  and  keeping  as  far  from the  dark water as  they might.  A  mile  southwards  along  the shore  they  came upon holly trees."
