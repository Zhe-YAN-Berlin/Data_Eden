Faramir stared at him for a moment in grave astonishment. Then suddenly  he caught him as he swayed, and lifting him gently, carried him  to the  bed  and laid  him there,  and covered him warmly.  At  once he fell into a  deep  sleep.       Another bed  was  set beside him for his  servant. Sam hesitated for  a   moment, then bowing very low: `Good night, Captain, my lord,' he said.  `You   took the chance, sir.'       `Did I so?' said Faramir.       `Yes sir, and showed your quality: the very highest.'       Faramir smiled. 'A pert servant, Master Samwise. But nay: the praise of  the  praiseworthy is above all rewards.  Yet  there  was naught  in  this to  praise. I had no lure or desire to do other than I have done.'       `Ah  well,  sir,' said Sam, `you said  my master had an elvish air  and  that was good and true. But I can say this:  you have an air too, sir,  that  reminds me of, of  -- well, Gandalf, of wizards.        'Maybe,'  said  Faramir. `Maybe you discern from  far away the  air  of  NÂ®menor. Good n ight!'     ####-   Chapter 6. The Forbidden Pool            Frodo  woke to  find  Faramir bending over him. For a  second old fears  seized him and he sat up and shrank away.       `There is nothing to fear,' said Faramir.       'Is it morning already? ' said Frodo yawning.       `Not yet, but night is drawing to an end, and the full moon is setting.  Will  you  come and see it?  Also there  is a matter on which I desire  your  counsel. I am sorry to rouse you from sleep, but will you come? '       `I will,' said Frodo, rising and shivering a little as he left the warm  blanket and pelts. It seemed cold in the  fireless  cave. The  noise of  the  water was loud in the stillness. He put on his cloak and followed Faramir.       Sam, waking  suddenly  by some instinct of watchfulness,  saw first his  master's empty  bed  and  leapt to his feet. Then  he saw  two dark figures,  Frodo  and a  man, framed  against the archway, which was now filled with  a  pale  white  light. He  hurried after  them,  past rows of men  sleeping  on  mattresses along the  wall. As he went by  the  cave-mouth  he saw  that the  Curtain was now become a dazzling veil of silk and pearls and silver thread:  melting icicles of moonlight. But he did not pause to admire it, and turning  aside he followed his  master thr ough the narrow  doorway in the wall of the  cave.       They went first  along a black passage, then up  many wet steps, and so  came to a small flat  landing cut in the stone  and  lit  by  the pale  sky,  gleaming  high  above through a  long deep shaft.  From here two flights  of  steps led: one going on, as it seemed, up on to the high bank of the stream;  the other turning away to the left. This they  followed. It wound its way up  like a turret-stair.       At last they came out of the stony darkness and looked about. They were  on a wide  flat rock without rail or parapet. At their right, eastwards, the  torrent fell, splashing over many terraces, and then,  pouring down  a steep  race, it filled  a smooth-hewn channel with  a  dark  force of water flecked  with  foam,  and curling and rushing almost at  their  feet it  plunged sheer   over the  edge that  yawned  upon their left.  A man  stood  there, near the   brink, silent, gazing down.       Frodo turned to  watch the sleek necks of the  water as they curved and   ####-dived.  Then he lifted his  eyes and gazed far away. The world was quiet and   cold,  as if dawn were near. Far off in  the West the full moon was sinking,  round and white. Pale mists shimmered in the  great vale below:  a wide gulf  of silver fume,  beneath which rolled the cool night-waters of the Anduin. A  black  darkness  loomed beyond,  and  in  it glinted, here and  there, cold,  sharp, remote, white as  the teeth of ghosts, the peaks of Ered Nimrais, the  White Mountains of the Realm of Gondor, tipped with everlasting snow.       For a while Frodo  stood  there on  the  high stone, and  a shiver  ran  through him,  wondering if anywhere in  the vastness  of the night -lands his  old companions walked  or slept,  or lay dead  shrouded in  mist. Why was he  brough t here out of forgetful sleep?        Sam was eager for  an answer to the same question and could not refrain  himself from muttering, for  his master's ear alone as  he thought: 'It's  a   fine view, no doubt, Mr. Frodo, but chilly to the heart, not to mention   the  bones! What's going on? '       Faramir heard and answered. `Moonset over Gondor. Fair Ithil as he goes  from Middle-earth,  glances upon  the white  locks of old Mindolluin.  It is  worth a few shivers. But that is not what I brought you to see-though as for  you,  Samwise,  you  were not  brought, and  do but pay  the penalty of your   watchfulness. A draught of wine shall amend it."
