There the River flows in stony  vale amid  high moors, until at last after many leagues it comes to the tall  island  of the Tindrock,  that we call Tol Brandir. There it casts its  arms  about the steep shores of the  isle, and falls then  with a  great noise and  smoke  over the cataracts of Rauros down into the Nindalf, the Wetwang as it  is called in your  tongue.  That  is a wide region of sluggish fen where the  stream becomes tortuous and much divided. There the Entwash flows in by  many  mouths from the Forest of  Fangorn  in the west. About that stream, on  this  side of the Great River, lies Rohan. On the further side are the bleak hills  of the Emyn Muil. The wind blows from the East there, for they look out over   the Dead Marshes and the Noman-lands to Cirith Gorgor and the black gates of  Mordor.       'Boromir, and any  that go with him seeking  Minas Tirith, will do well  to leave the Great River  above Rauros and cross the Entwash before it finds  the marshes.  Yet  they  should  not  go too far  up  that  stream, nor risk   becoming entangled in the  Forest of Fangorn. That is a strange land, and is  now  little  known. But  Boromir  and Aragorn  doubtless  do  not  need this  warning.'       'Indeed we have heard  of Fangorn in  Minas Tirith,' said Boromir. `But  what I have heard seems to me for the most part old wives' tales, such as we   tell to our children. All that lies north of Rohan is now  to us so far away  that fancy can wander freely there. Of old Fangorn lay  upon the  borders of  our realm; but it is now many lives of men since  any of  us  visited it, to  prove or disprove the legends that have come down from distant years.       `I have myself  been at whiles in Rohan, but I have  never  crossed  it  northwards. When I  was sent out as a messenger, I passed through the Gap by  the skirts  of the White Mountains,  and crossed the Isen  and the Greyflood   into Northerland.  A  long and wearisome  journey.  Four  hundred  leagues I  reckoned it, and it took me many  months; for  I lost my horse at Tharbad, at  the fording  of  the  Greyflood. After that  journey,  and  the road  I have   ####-trodden  with  this Company, I  do  not much doubt  that I shall find a  way  through Rohan, and Fangorn too, if need be.'       `Then  I need say no more,' said Celeborn. 'But do not despise the lore  that has come down from distant years; for oft it may chance  that old wives  keep in memory word of things that once were needful for the wise to know.'       Now Galadriel rose  from the grass, and taking a  cup  from one  of her   maidens she filled it with white mead and gave it to Celeborn.       'Now it is time  to drink the cup of  farewell,' she said. `Drink, Lord  of  the Galadhrim!  And let not your heart be  sad though night  must follow  noon, and already our evening draweth nigh.'       Then  she brought  the  cup to each of the Company, and bade them drink   and farewell. But when they had drunk she commanded them to sit again on the  grass,  and  chairs were set  for her and  for Celeborn.  Her maidens   stood  silent about her, and a while  she looked upon her guests. At last she spoke  again.       'We have drunk  the cup of  parting,' she  said, `and the  shadows fall  between us. But  before you go,  I have brought in  my ship gifts  which the  Lord and Lady of the Galadhrim now offer  you in memory of Lothlurien.'  Then  she called to each in turn.       `Here is  the gift  of Celeborn  and  Galadriel to the  leader  of your  Company,' she  said to Aragorn, and she gave him a sheath that had been made  to fit his sword.  It was  overlaid  with  a  tracery of flowers  and leaves  wrought of silver and gold, and on it were set in elven runes formed of many  gems the name AndÂ®ril and the lineage of the sword.       `The  blade  that  is  drawn from  this  sheath shall  not be stained or   broken  even in  defeat,' she said. `But is there aught else that you desire  of me at our parting? For  darkness will flow between us, and it may be that  we shall  not meet  again, unless it be far  hence upon  a  road that has no  returning.'       And Aragorn answered: 'Lady, you know  all my desire, and  long held in  keeping the only  treasure that I seek. Yet it is not yours to give me, even  if you would; and only through darkness shall I come to it.'       `Yet maybe this will lighten  your heart,' said Galadriel;  `for it was  left in my care to be given to you, should you pass through this land.' Then  she lifted from  her lap  a  great stone  of a clear green, set in  a silver   brooch that  was wrought in the likeness of an eagle with  outspread  wings;    ####-and as  she held  it  up  the gem flashed  like the sun shining through  the  leaves  of spring."
