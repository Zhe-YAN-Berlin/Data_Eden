Pippin saw his carven face with its proud  bones  and skin like ivory, and the long  curved nose between  the dark deep  eyes; and he was reminded not so much of Boromir as of Aragor n.  'Dark  indeed  is the hour,' said  the old  man, 'and  at such times you are  wont to come,  Mithrandir.  But though all  the  signs forebode that the  doom of Gondor is  drawing  nigh, less now to me is  that darkness than my own darkness. It has  been told to me that you bring with you one who saw my son die. Is this he?'       'It is,' said Gandalf. 'One  of the twain. The other is with Thjoden of  Rohan and may come hereafter.  Halflings  they are,  as you see, yet this is  not he of whom the omens spoke.'       'Yet  a  Halfling still,' said Denethor  grimly, 'and little love do  I  bear the name, since those  accursed words  came to trouble our counsels and  drew away my son on the  wild errand to his  death. My Boromir!  Now we  have  need of you. Faramir should have gone in his stead.'       'He would  have  gone,' said  Gandalf.  'Be not unjust  in your  grief!   Boromir claimed the errand and would not suffer any other to have it. He was  a masterful man, and one  to take what he desired. I journeyed far  with him   ####-and learned much of  his mood. But you speak of his death. You have had news  of that ere we came?'       'I  have received  this,'  said Denethor, and laying  down his  rod  he  lifted from his lap the  thing that  he had been gazing at.  In each hand he  held up one half  of a great  horn cloven through the middle: a wild-ox horn  bound with silver.       'That is the horn that Boromir always wore!' cried Pippin.       'Verily,'  said  Denethor. 'And in  my turn  I bore it, and so did each  eldest son of our house, far back into the vanished years before the failing  of the kings, since  Vorondil father  of Mardil hunted the wild kine of Araw  in the  far fields of Rhyn. I heard it blowing dim upon the northern marches  thirteen  days ago, and the River brought  it to me, broken: it will wind no  more.' He paused and there was a heavy silence. Suddenly he turned his black  glance upon Pippin. 'What say you to that, Halfling?'       'Thirteen, thirteen days,' faltered Pippin. 'Yes, I think that would be  so. Yes, I stood beside him,  as he blew the  horn. But  no help  came. Only  more orcs.'       'So,' said  Denethor, looking keenly at Pippin's face. 'You were there?   Tell me more! Why did no help  come? And how  did you escape, and yet he  did  not, so mighty a man as he wa s, and only orcs to withstand him?'       Pippin flushed and forgot his fear. 'The mightiest man may be slain  by  one arrow,'  he said; 'and Boromir was pierced by  many. When last I saw him  he sank  beside  a tree and plucked a black -feathered shaft  from  his side.  Then I swooned  and was made  captive. I saw him no more, and know  no  more.  But I honour his memory,  for he was very  valiant.  He died to save  us, my  kinsman Meriadoc and myself, waylaid in the woods by  the  soldiery  of  the  Dark Lord; and though he fell and failed, my gratitude is none the less.'       Then Pippin looked the old man in  the eye, for pride stirred strangely  within  him, still stung  by  the scorn  and suspicion in that  cold  voice.  'Little service, no  doubt, will so great a lord of Men  think to  find in a   hobbit, a halfling from the northern Shire; yet such as it is, I  will offer   it,  in payment  of my  debt.'  Twitching  aside his grey cloak, Pippin drew  forth his small sword and laid it at Denethor's feet.       A pale smile, like a gleam of  cold sun  on a winter's evening,  passed  over the old man's face; but he  bent his head and held out his hand, laying   ####-the shards of the horn aside. 'Give me the weapon!' he said.       Pippin lifted it  and presented the hilt  to him.   'Whence  came this?'  said Denethor.  'Many, many years lie on it.  Surely this is a blade wrought  by our own kindred in the North in the deep past?'       'It came out of the mounds that lie on the borders of my country ' said  Pippin.  'But only evil wights dwell there now, and I will not willingly tell   more of them.'       'I see that strange tales  are woven about you,'  said  Denethor,  'and  once again it  is shown  that looks may belie the man  -  or the  halfling. I  accept  your  service.  For you  are not  daunted  by  words;  and you  have  courteous  speech, strange though the sound of it may be to us in the South.  And we shall have  need of all folk of courtesy, be they great  or small, in  the days to come. Swear to me now!'       'Take the hilt,' said Gandalf,  'and speak after the Lord, if  you  are  resolved on this.'       'I am,' said Pippin.       The  old man laid  the  sword along his lap, and Pippin put his hand to  the hilt, and said slowly after Denethor:       'Here do I swear  fealty and  service  to  Gondor, and  to the Lord and  Steward of the realm, to  speak and to be silent,  to do and  to let be,  to  come and to go, in need or plenty, in peace or war, in living or dying, from  this hour  henceforth, until my  lord  release me, or death take me , or  the  world end."
