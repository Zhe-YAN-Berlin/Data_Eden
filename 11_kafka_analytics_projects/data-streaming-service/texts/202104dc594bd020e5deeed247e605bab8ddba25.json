  "text": " I shall call you all before the break of day.'       When at last he  had got to bed, Frodo could not sleep for  some  time.  His  legs ached. He. was  glad that he was riding in the morning. Eventually  he fell into a  vague dream, in which he seemed to be looking  out of a high  window over  a dark  sea of tangled trees.  Down below among the roots there  was the sound of creatures  crawling and snuffling.  He felt sure they would   smell him out sooner or later.       Then  he heard a noise in the distance.  At first he thought  it  was a   great wind  coming over the leaves of the forest. Then  he knew  that it was  not leaves, but the sound of the  Sea far-off; a sound he had never heard in  waking life, though it  had often  troubled his dreams. Suddenly he found he  was out in the open. There were no trees after all. He was on  a dark heath,  and there was a strange salt smell in  the air. Looking up he saw before him  a tall white tower, standing alone on a high ridge. A great desire came over   him to climb the tower and see the Sea. He started to struggle  up the ridge  towards the  tower:  but  suddenly a light came in  the sky, and there was a   noise of thunder.       ####-<h4>Chapter 6.</h4> <br> The Old Forest            Frodo woke suddenly. It was still dark in  the room. Merry was standing  there with a candle  in one hand, and banging  on the  door with the  other.  'All right! What is it?' said Frodo, still shaken and bewildered.       'What is it!' cried Merry. 'It is  time to get up. It is half past four  and very foggy. Come on! Sam is already getting breakfast ready. Even Pippin  is up. I am just going to saddle the ponies, and fetch the one that is to be  the  baggage-carrier. Wake that sluggard Fatty! At least he must get up  and   see us off.'       Soon after  six o'clock the  five  hobbits were  ready  to start. Fatty  Bolger was still yawning. They stole quietly out of the house. Merry went in  front leading a laden pony, and took his way along a path that  went through  a spinney behind  the house, and then  cut across several fields. The leaves  of  trees were  glistening, and every twig  was dripping; the grass was grey  with  cold dew. Everything was  still,  and far-away  noises seemed near and  clear:  fowls chattering  in a yard,  someone closing a  door of  a  distant  house.       In their shed they found the ponies;  sturdy  little beasts of the kind  loved by hobbits, not speedy, but good for  a long day's work. They mounted,  and  soon  they  were  riding off  into  the  mist,  which  seemed  to  open  reluctantly before them and close forbiddingly behind them. After riding for   about  an  hour,  slowly  and without talking,  they  saw  the Hedge looming   suddenly ahead. It was tall and netted over  with silver cobwebs.  'How  are  you  going to get  through  this?'  asked Fredegar. 'Follow me!' said Merry,  'and you will see.' He turned to the  left  along  the Hedge, and  soon they  came to a point  wher e it bent inwards, running along the lip of a hollow. A  cutting  had been made, at  some distance from the  Hedge, and  went sloping  gently down into the ground. It had walls of brick at  the sides, which rose  steadily,  until suddenly  they arched  over a nd formed a  tunnel that dived  deep under the Hedge and came out in the hollow on the other side.       Here Fatty Bolger halted. 'Good-bye, Frodo!' he  said.  'I wish you were  not going into the Forest. I only hope you will not need rescuing before the  day is out. But good luck to you - today and every day!'       'If there  are no worse things ahead  than  the Old Forest, I  shall be  lucky,'  said  Frodo. 'Tell Gandalf to hurry along the  East Road: we  shall   ####-soon be back on it and going as fast as we can.'  'Good-bye!' they cried, and  rode down the slope and disappeared from Fredegar's sight into the tunnel.       It  was  dark and  damp. At the far  end it  was  closed  by  a gate of  thick -set iron bars. Merry got down and unlocked the gate, and when they had  all passed through he pushed it to again. It shut with a clang, and the lock   clicked. The sound was ominous.       'There!' said Merry. 'You have left the Shire, and are now outside, and  on the edge of the Old Forest.'       'Are the stories about it true?' asked Pippin.       'I don't know what  stories you mean,' Merry answered. 'If you mean the  old bogey-stories Fatty's nurses  used to tell him, about goblins and wolves  and things of that sort, I should say no. At any rate I  don't believe them.  But the  Forest is queer. Everything in it  is very  much more  alive,  more  aware of what is going on, so to  speak, than things  are in the  Shire. And  the  trees do not like strangers. They watch  you. They  are usually content  merely to  watch  you,  as  long  a s  daylight  lasts,  and  don't  do much.  Occasionally the most unfriendly ones may drop a  branch,  or  stick  a root  out,  or grasp at you with a long trailer. But at  night things  can be most   alarming,  or so I am  told."
