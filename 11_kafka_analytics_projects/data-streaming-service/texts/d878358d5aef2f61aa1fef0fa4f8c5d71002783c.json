'The New Age begins,' said Gandalf, 'and in this age it may  well prove  that the  kingdoms of Men shall outlast you, Fangor n my friend. But now come  tell me: what of the task that I set you? How is Saruman? Is he not weary of  Orthanc yet? For I do  not suppose that he will think you  have improved the  view from his windows.'       Treebeard gave Gandalf a long look, a most cunning look, Merry thought.  'Ah!'  he said.  'I thought you would come to  that. Weary of  Orthanc? Very  weary  at last; but  not so weary of his tower as he  was weary of my voice.  Hoom! I gave  him some long tales, or at least what might be thought long in  your speech.'       'Then why  did he  stay  to  listen?  Did  you go into  Orthanc?' asked  Gandalf.       'Hoom,  no, not  into Orthanc!'  said  Treebeard. 'But he came  to  his  window and listened,  because he could  not get news in any  other  way, and  though he hated the news, he was greedy to have it; and  I saw that he heard  it all. But I added a great many things to the news that it was good for him  to think of. He grew very weary. He always was hasty. That was his ruin.'   ####-     'l  observe, my good  Fangorn,' said Gandalf,  'that with great care you   say dwelt, was, grew. What about is? Is he dead?'       'No, not dead, so far as I know,' said Treebeard. 'But he is gone. Yes,  he is gone seven days.  I let him go.  There  was little left of him when he  crawl ed  out,  and as  for  that worm-creature of his,  he was  like  a pale  shadow. Now do not tell me, Gandalf, that I promised to keep him safe; for I   know it.  But things have changed since then.  And  I kept him until  he was  safe, safe from doing any  mor e harm. You should know that above all  I hate  the  caging of live things, and I will not keep even such creatures as these  caged beyond great need. A snake without fangs may crawl where he will.'       'You may be right,'  said Gandalf; 'but this snake  had still one tooth  left, I think. He had the poison of his voice, and I guess that he persuaded  you, even you Treebeard,  knowing the soft spot in your heart.  Well,  he is  gone, and there is no more to be said.  But the Tower  of  Orthanc now  goes  back to  the King, to whom it belongs. Though maybe he will not need it.'       'That  will  be seen later,' said Aragorn. 'But I will give to Ents all  this valley  to  do with as they will, so long  as  they  keep a watch  upon  Orthanc and see that none enter it without my leave.'       'It is locked,' said Treebeard. 'I made Saruman lock it and give me the  keys. Quickbeam has them.'       Quickbeam  bowed like a tree bending in the wind and  handed to Aragorn  two great black keys of intricate shape, joined by a  ring of steel.  'Now I  thank you once more,' said Aragorn, 'and I bid you farewell. May your forest  grow again in peace. When  this valley is filled there  is room and to spare  west of the mountains, where once you walked long ago.'       Treebeard's face became sad. 'Forests may  grow,' he  said.  'Woods may  spread. But not Ents. There are no Entings.'       'Yet maybe there is now more hope in your search,' said Aragorn. 'Lands  will lie open to you eastward that have long been closed.'       But  Treebeard shook his head and said: 'It is far to go. And there are  too  many Men there in these days. But I am forgetting  my manners! Will you   stay here and rest a  while? And maybe there are  some that would be pleased  to pass through Fangorn Forest and so shorten their road home?' He looked at  Celeborn and Galadriel.       But  all  save Legolas said  that they  must  now take  their leave and  depart, either south or west. 'Come, Gimli!' said Legolas. 'Now by Fangorn's  leave I will visit the deep places of the Entwood and  see such trees as are   ####-nowhere  else  to be found in Middle-earth. You  shall come with me and keep  your word; and thus we will journey on together to our own lands in Mirkwood  and beyond.' To this Gimli agreed, though with no great delight, it seemed.       'Here  then  at last comes the ending of the Fellowship  of  the Ring,'  said Aragorn. 'Yet I hope that ere long you will  return to my land with the  help that you promised.'       'We will come, if our own lords allow it,' said Gimli. 'Well, farewell.  my hobbits! You  should  come safe to your own homes now, and I shall not be  kept  awake for fear  of your peril. We will send word when we may, and some  of us  may yet meet at times; but I fear that we shall not all  be  gathered  together ever again.'       Then Treebeard  said farewell to  each of  them  in turn, and  he bowed  three times slowly and with great reverence to Celeborn and  Galadriel.  'It  is long,  long since we  met by stock  or by  stone, A  vanimar,  vanimblion  nostari!' he said. 'It is sad that we should meet only  thus at  the ending."
