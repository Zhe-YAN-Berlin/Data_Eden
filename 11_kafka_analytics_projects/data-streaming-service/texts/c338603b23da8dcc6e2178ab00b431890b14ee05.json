And here in Rivendell there live  still some of his  chief  foes: the Elven-wise, lords of the Eldar from beyond the furthest seas. They   do not fear the Ringwraiths, for those who have dwelt in the  Blessed  Realm  live at  once in both worlds, and against both the  Seen and the Unseen they  have great power.'       'I  thought that I saw  a white figure that shone and did not  grow dim  like the others. Was that Glorfindel then?'       'Yes, you saw him for a moment as he is upon the other side: one of the  mighty  of  the Firstborn. He is an Elf-lord  of a  house of princes. Indeed  there is a power in Rivendell to withstand the might of Mordor, for a while:  and elsewhere other powers still dwell. There is power, too, of another kind  in the Shire. But all  such places will soon  become islands under siege, if  things  go  on  as they are going. The Dark  Lord is  putting forth all  his  strength.       `Still,' he said, standing suddenly up and sticking out his chin. while  his beard went  stiff and straight like bristling wire, `we must keep up our  courage. You will  soon be  well, if I do not talk you  to death. You are in  Rivendell, and you need not worry about anything for the present.'       'I haven't any courage to  keep up,'  said Frodo, `but I am not worried  at  the moment. Just give me news of my friends, and tell  me the end of the   affair at the  Ford, as I  keep on asking,  and I shall be  content  for the  present. After that  I  shall have  another sleep, I  think; but I shan't be   ####-able to close my eyes until you have finished the story for me.'       Gandalf moved  his chair to the bedside, and took a good look at Frodo.  The colour  had come  back to his face, and his  eyes were clear, and  fully  awake  and aware. He was smiling,  and there seemed to be  little wrong with  him. But to the wizard's eye there was a faint change just a hint as it were  of transparency,  about  him, and especially  about  the left  hand that lay  outside upon the coverlet.       `Still that must be expected,' said Gandalf to himself. `He is not half  through  yet,  and to what  he  will  come in the  end  not even  Elrond can  foretell. Not  to evil, I think. He may become  like a glass filled  with  a   clear light for eyes to see that can.'       `You look splendid,' he  said aloud. `I  will risk a brief tale without  consulting Elrond. But quite brief, mind you, and then you must sleep again.  This is what happened, as far  as I can gather. The Riders made straight for   you, as soon as you fled. They did not need the guidance of their horses any   longer: you  had become visible to  them, being already on the threshold  of  their world. And also the Ring drew them. Your friends sprang aside, off the  road, or they would have been ridden down. They knew that nothing could save  you,  if  the white horse could  not. The Riders were too swift to overtake,  and too many to oppose.  On foot even  Glorfindel and Aragorn together could  not with stand all the Nine at once.       `When the Ringwraiths  swept  by, your friends ran up behind.  Close to  the Ford  there is a small hollow  beside  the  road masked by a few stunted  trees.  There they hastily  kindled fire; for  Glorfindel knew that a  flood  would come down, if  the Riders  tried  to cross,  and then he would have to  deal with any that were left on his side of the river. The moment the  flood  appeared, he rushed  out, followed by  Aragorn and the. others  with flaming   brands. Caught between  fire and water, and seeing  an Elf-lord revealed  in  his wrath, they were dismayed, and their  horses were stricken with madness.  Three were  carried away by the first assault  of the flood; the others were  now hurled into the water by their horses and overwhelmed.'       'And is that the end of the Black Riders?' asked Frodo.       'No,' said Gandalf. 'Their horses must have perished,  and without them  they  are crippled.  But  the  Ringwraiths  themselves cannot  be  so easily  destroyed. However, there is nothing more to fear from them at present. Your  friends crossed after the  flood had passed; and they found you lying on your   face at the top of the  bank, with  a broken sword under you. The horse  was   ####-standing guard beside you. You were  pale and cold, and they feared that you  were  dead,  or  worse.  Elrond's folk met them, carrying you slowly towards  Rivendell.'       `Who made the flood?' asked Frodo.       'Elrond  commanded it,' answered  Gandalf. `The river of this valley is  under his power, and it will rise in anger when he has great need to bar the  Ford.  As soon as the  captain  of the Ringwraiths rode into  the  water the  flood was released.  If I may say so, I added a few touches of  my  own: you   may  not have noticed, but some of the waves  took the  form of  great white  horses with shining  white riders; and there wer e many rolling and  grinding  boulders."
