  "text": " All the company drew away from Pippin and Sam,  who  found themselves left alone in a comer, and eyed darkly and  doubtfully from  a  distance.  It was  plain  that many  people  regarded  them  now  as  the  companions of a travelling magician of unknown powers and purpose. But  there  was one  swarthy Bree-lander, who stood looking at them with  a knowing  and  half-mocking expression that made them feel very uncomfortable. Presently he  slipped out of the door, followed by the squint-eyed southerner: the two had  been  whispering  together  a  good  deal  during  the  evening.  Harry  the  gatekeeper also went out just behind them..       Frodo felt  a fool. Not knowing what else  to do, he crawled away under    ####-the tables to the  dark comer by Strider, who sat unmoved, giving no sign of  his thoughts. Frodo leaned back  against the wall and took off the Ring. How  it came to be on his finger he could not tell. He could only suppose that he  had  been handling it in his pocket while he sang, and  that somehow  it had  slipped on  when he stuck out  his hand with a jerk to save his  fall. For a   moment he wondered if the Ring itself had not played him a trick; perhaps it  had tried to reveal itself in response to some wish or command that was felt  in the room. He did not like the looks of the men that had gone out.       'Well?' said Strider, when he rea ppeared.  'Why did you do that?  Worse  than anything your friends could have said! You have put your foot in it! Or   should I say your finger?'       'I don't know what you mean,' said Frodo, annoyed and alarmed.       'Oh yes, you do,' answered Strider; 'but  we had better wait  until the  uproar has  died down. Then, if you  please, Mr.  Baggins, I should  like  a   quiet word with you.'       'What about?' asked Frodo, ignoring the sudden use of his proper name.       'A matter of  some importance  -  to us both,' answered Strider, looking  Frodo in the eye. 'You may hear something to your advantage.'       'Very  well,' said Frodo,  trying to appear unconcerned. 'I'll talk  to  you later.'       Meanwhile an argument was going on by the  fireplace. Mr. Butterbur had  come trotting  in, and  he was now  trying  to listen to several conflicting  accounts of the event at the same time.       'I saw him, Mr.  Butterbur,' said a hobbit;  'or leastways I didn't see  him, if you take my meaning. He just vanished  into thin air, in a manner of  speaking.'       'You don't say, Mr. Mugwort!' said the landlord, looking puzzled.       'Yes I do!' replied Mugwort. 'And I mean what I say, what's more.'       'There's some  mistake  somewhere,' said  Butterbur,  shaking his head.  There was  too much of  that Mr. Underhill to go vanishing  into thin air; or   into thick air, as is more likely in this room.'       'Well, where is he now?' cried several voices.        'How should I  know?  He's welcome to go  where he will, so long as  he   pays in the  morning. There's Mr. Took, now: he's not vanished.'       'Well,  I  saw what I  saw,  and  I saw what I  didn't,'  said  Mugwort  obstinately.       'And I say there's  some mistake,' repeated  Butterbur,  picking up the   ####-tray and gathering up the broken crockery.       'Of course there's a mistake!' said Frodo. 'I haven't vanished. Here  I  am! I've just been having a few words with Strider in the comer.'       He  came forward into  the  firelight;  but most of the company  backed  away,, even more perturbed than before. They were not in the least satisfied  by his explanation that he had crawled away quickly  under the  tables after   he  had fallen. Most of the  Hobbits  and the Men of Bree went off then  and  there in a huff, having no fancy for further entertainment that evening. One  or two gave Frodo a black look and departed muttering among themselves.   The  Dwarves and the two or three strange Men that still remained got up and said  good night to the landlord, but not to Frodo and his friends. Before long no  one was left but Strider, who sat on, unnoticed, by the wall.       Mr. Butterbur did  not seem  much put out. He reckoned,  very probably,   that his house would be full again on many future  nights, until the present  mystery had been  thoroughly discussed. 'N ow what have  you been doing,  Mr.  Underhill?'  he asked.  'Frightening  my customers and breaking up my crocks  with your acrobatics!'       'I am very sorry to have caused any trouble,' said Frodo. 'It was quite  unintentional, I assure you. A most unfortunate accident.'       'All right, Mr. Underhill! But if you're going to do any more tumbling,  or conjuring, or whatever it was, you'd best warn folk beforehand  - and warn  me. We're a bit suspicious round here of anything  out of  the way -uncanny,   if you understand me; and we don't take to it all of a sudden.'       'I shan't be doing anything of the sort again, Mr. Butterbur, I promise  you.  And now  I think I'll be getting  to bed. We shall be  making an early  start."
