Sam stepped back and braced his feet against a stump a yard or two from  the edge.  Half hauled, half scrambling. Frodo came up  and threw himself on  the ground.       Thunder growled  and  rumbled in the distance,  and the rain was  still  falling heavily. The hobbits crawled away back into the gully; but  they did  not find  much shelter there.  Rills of water began  to run down;  soon they  grew to a spate that splashed and fumed on the  stones, and spouted out over   the cliff like the gutters of a vast roof.       `I should have been half drowned down there, or washed clean off,' said  Frodo. 'What a piece of luck you had that rope!'       `Better  luck  if  I'd thought  of  it sooner,'  said Sam.  'Maybe  you   remember them putting the  ropes in the boats,  as we started  off:  in  the  elvish country. I took a fancy to it, and  I stowed a coil in my pack. Years  ago, it seems.  \"It may be a help in many needs,\" he said: Haldir, or one of  those folk. And he spoke right.'       `A  pity I didn't think of bringing another length,' said Frodo; `but I  left  the  Company in such a hurry and confusion. If  only  we had enough we  could use it to get down. How long is your rope, I wonder?'       Sam paid it out slowly, measuring it with his arms: 'Five, ten, twenty,   ####-thirty ells, more or less,' he said.       'Who'd have  thought it!' Frodo exclaimed.       `Ah! Who would? ' said Sam. `Elves are wonderful folk. It looks  a  bit  thin, but it's tough; and soft as milk to the  hand. Packs close too, and as  light as light. Wonderful folk to be sure!'       `Thirty ells! '  said Frodo considering. 'I believe it would be enough.  If the storm passes before nightfall, I'm going to try it.'       `The rain's nearly  given over already,'  said Sam;  'but  don't you go  doing anything risky in the  dim again, Mr.  Frodo! And I  haven't  got over  that shriek on the wind yet, if you have. Like a Black Rider it  sounded-but  one up in the air, if they can fly.  I'm  thinking we'd  best lay up in this  crack till night's over.'       'And I'm  thinking that I won't spend a moment longer than I need stuck   up on this edge with the eyes of the Dark Country looking over the marshes,'  said Frodo.       With  that he stood up and went  down to the bottom of the gully again.  He looked out.  Clear sky  was  growing in the East once more. The skirts of  the  storm were lifting, ragged and wet, and the  main  battle had passed to  spread its great wings over the Emyn  Muil; upon which  the dark thought  of  Sauron brooded for a  while.  Thence it turned, smiting  the Vale of  Anduin  with hail  and lightning,  and  casting its shadow upon  Minas  Tirith  with  threat  of  war.  Then,  lowering in the mountains,  and gathering its great  spires,  it rolled on slowly over Gondor  and the skirts of Rohan, until far  away the Riders on  the plain saw its black towers mov ing behind the sun, as  they  rode into the West. But here, over the desert and the  reeking marshes  the  deep  blue sky of  evening  opened once  more, and  a few  pallid stars  appeared, like small white holes in the canopy above the crescent moon.       `It's good  to be able to see again,' said Frodo,  breathing  deep. `Do  you know, I thought for a  bit that I had lost my sight? From  the lightning  or something else worse. I could see nothing, nothing at all, until the grey  rope came down. It seemed to shimmer somehow.'       `It does look  sort of silver in the dark,' said Sam. `Never noticed it  before, though I can't remember as I've ever had it out since I first stowed  it. But if you're so set on climbing, Mr. Frodo,  how  are you  going to use  it?  Thirty ells, or  say, about eighteen fathom: that's  no  more than your  guess at the height of the cliff.'       Frodo thought for a while. `Make it fast to that stump, Sam! ' he said.   ####-`Then I think  you  shall have your wish this time and go first. I'll  lower   you, and you need do no more than use  your feet and hands  to fend yourself  off the rock. Though, if you put your weight on  some of the ledges and give  me a  rest, it will help. When you're down, I'll follow. I feel quite myself  again now.'       'Very well,' said Sam heavily. `If it must be, let's get it  over! ' He  took up the rope and made it fast over the stump nearest  to the brink; then  the  other  end  he tied about  his own waist.  Reluctantly  he  turned  and  prepared to go over the edge a second time.       It did not, however, turn  out half as bad as he had expected. The rope  seemed  to give him confidence, though he  shut his eyes more than once when  he looked down between his feet. There was one awkward spot, where there  was  no ledge and the wa ll was sheer and even undercut for  a short  space; there  he slipped and  swung  out on the silver  line. But Frodo lowered him slowly  and steadily, and  it was over at  last."
