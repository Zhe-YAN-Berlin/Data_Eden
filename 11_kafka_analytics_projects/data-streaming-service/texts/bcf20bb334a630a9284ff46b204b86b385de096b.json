  "text": " Still he's a Baggins, my precious,   yes,  a  Baggins.  A  Baggins  stole it. He  found it  and  he said nothing,  nothing. We hates Bagginses.'       'No, not this Baggins.'       'Yes, every Baggins. All peoples  that  keep the Precious. We must have  it!  '       `But He'll see, He'll know. He'll take it from us! '       'He sees.  He knows.  He  heard us make silly  promises   -- against His  orders, yes. Must take it. The Wraiths are searching. Must take it.'       'Not for Him! '       'No, sweet  one. See, my precious: if  we  has it, then we  can escape,  even from Him, eh? Perhaps we grows very strong, stronger than Wraiths. Lord  Smjagol? Gollum  the Great?  The Gollum! Eat fish every day,  three times  a  day; fresh from the sea. Most Precious Gollum! Must have it. We wants it, we  wants it, we wants it!  '       'But there's two of them. They'll wake too quick and kill  us,'  whined  Smjagol in a last effort. `Not now. Not yet.'       'We  wants  it! But'  -- and here there  was a  long  pause, as if a new  thought had wakened.  `Not yet,  eh? Perhaps not. She might help. She might,  yes.'       `No, no! Not that way! ' wailed Smjagol.       `Yes! We wants it! We wants it! '       Each time that  the second thought spoke, Gollum's  long hand crept out  slowly, pawing towards Frodo, and then was drawn back with a jerk as  Smjagol  spoke  again. Finally  both  arms,  with long fingers  flexed and twitching,   ####-clawed towards his neck.       Sam had lain  still, fascinated by this debate, but watching every move  that Gollum made  from under  his half-closed eye-lids.  To  his simple mind  ordinary  hunger, the desire to eat hobbits, had seemed the chief  danger in  Gollum. He realized  now that it was not so: Gollum was feeling the terrible  call  of the Ring. The Dark Lord was He, of course; but Sam wondered who  She  was. One of  the nasty friends the little wretch had made in his wanderings,  he supposed.  Then he  forgot the  point, for things had  plainly  gone  far  enough, and were getting dangerous. A great heaviness  was in all his limbs,   but he roused  himself with an effort and sat up. Something warned him to be  careful  and  not to reveal that he had overheard  the debate. He let  out a   loud sigh and gave a huge yawn.       `What's the time? ' he said sleepily.       Gollum sent  out a  long  hiss  through his  teeth. He stood  up  for a   moment, tense and menacing; and then he collapsed, falling forward on to all  fours and  crawling  up the bank  of the pit. 'Nice hobbits! Nice Sam! '  he  said. 'Sleepy heads,  yes, sleepy  heads! Leave good  Smjagol to watch!  But  it's evening. Dusk is creeping. Time to go.'       `High time!  ' thought Sam. 'And time we parted,  too.' Yet it  crossed  his mind to wonder if indeed Gollum was not now as dangerous turned loose as  kept with them. 'Curse him! I wish he was choked!' he muttered.  He stumbled  down the bank and roused his master.       Strangely enough, Frodo felt  refreshed. He had been dreaming. The dark   shadow  had  passed,  and  a  fair  vision  had visited him in  this land of  disease. Nothing remained  of it in his  memory, yet  because of it he  felt  glad and lighter of heart. His burden was less heavy on him. Gollum welcomed  him  with  dog-like delight. He  chuckled and  chattered,  cracking his long  fingers, and pawing at Frodo's knees. Frodo smiled at him.       'Come! ' he said. `You  have guided us well and faithfully. This is the  last stage. Bring us to the Gate, and then I will not ask you to go further.  Bring us to  the Gate,  and you  may  go where you wish  --  only not to our  enemies.'       'To  the Gate, eh?' Gollum squeaked, seeming surprised  and frightened.  'To the Gate, master  says! Yes, he says so.  And  good Smjagol does what he  asks, O yes. But when we gets closer, we'll  see perhaps we'll  see then. It  won't look nice at all. O no! O no!'   ####-     'Go on with you! ' said Sam. `Let's get it over! '       In the falling dusk they  scrambled out of the pit and slowly  threaded  their way through the dead land. They had not gone far before they felt once  more the fear that had fallen on them  when  the winged shape swept over the  marshes.  They  halted, cowering  on the evil -smelling ground; but  they saw  nothing  in the gloomy evening sky above, and soon the  menace  passed, high  overhead, going maybe  on some swift errand  from Barad-dyr.  After  a while  Gollum got up and crept forward again, muttering and shaking.       About an hour after midnight the fear fell on them a third time, but it  now seemed more remote, as if it were passing far above the clouds,  rushing  with terrible  speed  into  the  West.  Gollum,  however,  was helpless with  terror, and was convinced that they were  being hunted, that  their approach  was known.       `Three times! ' he  whimpered.  'Three times is  a threat. They feel us  here, they feel the Precious. The Precious is their master. We cannot go any   further this way, no."
