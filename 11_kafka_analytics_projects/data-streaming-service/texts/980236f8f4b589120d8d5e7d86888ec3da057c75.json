  "text": " The grots  and  rocky  walls were  already  starred  with  saxifrages  and  stonecrops.   Primeroles  and anemones were awake in the  filbert -brakes; and asphodel and  many  lily-flowers  nodded their half-opened heads in the grass: deep  green  grass beside  the pools,  where  falling streams  halted  in cool hollows on   ####-their journey down to Anduin.       The  travellers  turned their backs on the road and  went downhill.  As  they walked, brushing their  way through bush  and herb,  sweet  odours rose  about  them. Gollum coughed and retched; but the hobbits  breathed deep, and  suddenly Sam laughed, for heart's ease not for jest. They followed a  stream  that went  quickly down before them. Presently  it  brought them to a  small  clear lake in a shallow dell: it lay in the broken ruins of an ancient stone  basin, the carven rim of  which was  almost wholly  covered  with mosses and  rose-brambles;  iris-swords stood in  ranks about it. and water -lily  leaves  floated on  its dark gently-rippling surface; but it was deep and fresh, and  spilled ever softly out over a stony lip at the far end.       Here they washed  themselves and  drank  their  fill at  the in-falling  freshet. Then they sought for a resting-place, and a hiding-place: for  this  land, fair-seeming  still, was nonetheless now territory of  the Enemy. They  had not come  very far from the road, and yet even  in so short a space they  had seen  scars of  the  old wars, and the newer wounds made by the Orcs and  other foul servants of the Dark Lord:  a  pit of uncovered filth and refuse;  trees hewn down wantonly  and  left to die, with evil runes or the fell sign  of the Eye cut in rude strokes on their bark.       Sam scrambling below the outfall of the lake. smelling and touching the  unfamiliar  plants  and  trees,  forgetful for  the moment  of  Mordor,  was  reminded suddenly  of their ever -present peril. He  stumbled on a ring still  scorched by fire,  and in the midst of it  he  found  a pile  of charred and  broken  bones  and skulls.  The  swift growth  of the wild  with  briar  and  eglantine and trailing  clematis was already drawing a veil  over this place  of dreadful feast and slaughter;  but it was not ancient. He hurried back to   his companions, but he said nothing: the bones  were best  left in peace and  not pawed and routed by Gollum.       `Let's  find a place to lie up in,' he said. 'Not lower down. Higher up  for me.'       A  little way back above the lake they found a  deep brown bed  of last   year's fern. Beyond it was a thicket of dark-leaved  bay-trees climbing up a   steep bank  that was crowned with old cedars. Here they  decided to rest and  pass  the day, which already promised to be  bright and warm. A good day for  strolling  on their way along the groves and glades of Ithilien; but  though  Orcs may shun the sunlight. there were too many places here where they could  lie hid  and  watch;  and  other  evil  eyes were  abroad:  Sauron had  many   ####-servants. Gollum, in any case, would not move under  the  Yellow. Face. Soon  it  would look over the dark  ridges of the Ephel DÂ®ath, and he would  faint  and cower in the light and heat.       Sam had  been giving earnest thought to food as they  marched. Now that  the despair  of  the  impassable Gate was behind  him,  he did  not feel  so  inclined as his master  to take no thought  for  their livelihood beyond the  end of their errand;  and anyway it seemed wiser to him to save the waybread  of the  Elves for worse times ahead.  Six  days or more had  passed since he  reckoned that they had only a bare supply for three weeks.       'If we  reach the Fire in  that time, we'll be lucky at this rate! ' he  thought. `And we might be wanting to get back. We might! '       Besides,  at  the  end  of a  long  night -march, and  after bathing and  drinking, he felt even more hungry than usual. A supper,  or a breakfast, by  the fire  in  the old kitchen  at  Bagshot Row was what he really wanted. An   idea struck him and he turned to Gollum. Gollum had just begun  to sneak off  on his own, and he was crawling away on all fours through the fern.       `Hi! Gollum! ' said Sam. `Where are you going?  Hunting? Well see here,  old  noser, you don't like our  food,  and I'd  not  be sorry  for  a change  myself.  Your new motto's always ready to help . Could you find anything  fit  for a hungry hobbit? '       `Yes, perhaps,  yes,' said Gollum. `Smjagol always helps, if they  asks  -- if they asks nicely.'       `Right!' said Sam `I does ask. And if that isn't nice enough, I begs.'       Gollum disappeared.  He  was away some  time, and  Frodo  after  a  few  mouthfuls of lembas settled deep into the brown  fern and went to sleep. Sam  looked  at  him. The early  daylight  was only just creeping  down into  the  shadows u nder the trees, but he saw his master's face very clearly, and  his  hands, too, lying at rest on the ground beside him. He was reminded suddenly  of Frodo as he had lain, asleep in  the  house of Elrond,  after his  deadly  wound."
