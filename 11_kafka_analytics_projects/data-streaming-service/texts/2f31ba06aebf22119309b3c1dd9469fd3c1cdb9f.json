But  fat men  who sell ale have many calls  to answer; and the power of  Sauron is still less than fear makes it. But in  the circle of Isengard, trapped and alone, it was not easy to think that the  hunters before whom all have fled or fallen would falter  in  the  Shire far  away.'   ####-     `I saw you!' cried Frodo. `You were walking backwards and forwards. The  moon shone in your hair.'       Gandalf paused astonished and looked at him. 'I t was only a dream' said  Frodo, `but it suddenly came back to me. I had  quite  forgotten it. It came  some time ago; after I left the Shire, I think.'       `Then it was  late in coming,' said Gandalf, 'as you will see. I was in  an evil plight. And those who know me will agree that I have seldom  been in  such need, and  do not bear such  misfortune  well. Gandalf the  Grey caught   like a fly in a spider's treacherous web! Yet  even  the most subtle spiders  may leave a weak thread.       `At first I  feared,  as Saruman  no doubt intended,  that Radagast had  also fallen. Yet I  had caught no  hint of anything wrong in his voice or in  his eye at our meeting. If I had, I should never have gone to Isengard, or I  should  have gone more warily. So Saruman guessed, and he had concealed  his  mind and deceived his messenger. It would have been  useless in  any case to  try and  win over  the honest Radagast  to  treachery. He sought me  in good  faith, and so persuaded me.       `That  was the  undoing of Saruman's plot.  For Radagast knew no reason  why  he should not do as I asked; and he rode away towards Mirkwood where  he  had many friends of old. And  the Eagles of the Mountains went far and wide,  and they saw many things: the gathering of wolves and the mustering of Orcs;  and  the Nine Riders going hither and thither in the  lands; and  they heard  news  of the  escape  of  Gollum.  And they sent a messenger to  bring these  tidings to me.       `So it  was  that when summer  waned, there came a night of  moon,  and  Gwaihir the Windlord,  swiftest of  the  Great Eagles,  came unlooked-for to  Orthanc; and he found me standing  on the pinnacle. Then I  spoke to him and  he bore me away, before Saruman was aware.  I was far from Isengard, ere the  wolves and orcs issued from the gate to pursue me.       ` \"How far can you bear me? \" I said to Gwaihir.       ` \"Many  leagues,\" said he,  \"but not to  the ends of the earth.  I was  sent to bear tidings not burdens.\"       ` \"Then I must have a steed on land,\" I said, \"and a steed surpassi ngly  swift, for I have never had such need of haste before.\"       ` \"Then I will bear you to Edoras, where the Lord  of Rohan sits in his  halls,\" he said; \"for that  is not very far off.\" And I was glad, for in the   ####-Riddermark of Rohan the  Rohirrim, the Horse-lords, dwell, and  there are no  horses  like  those that  are  bred in  that  great vale  between the  Misty  Mountains and the White.       ` \"Are the Men of  Rohan still to be trusted, do you think? \" I said to  Gwaihir, for the treason of Saruman had shaken my faith.       ` \"They pay a tribute of horses,\" he answered, \"and send many yearly to  Mordor,  or  so it is said; but they are  not  yet under the  yoke.  But  if  Saruman  has  become evil,  as  you  say, then  their  doom  cannot  be long  delayed.\"       `He  set  me down  in  the  land of  Rohan ere  dawn;  and  now I  have  lengthened my tale over long. The  rest must be more brief. In Rohan I found  evil already at work:  the lies  of Saruman; and the king  of the land would  not  listen to my warnings. He bade me take a horse and be gone; and I chose  one much to my liking. but little to his. I took the best horse in his land,  and I have never seen the like of him.'       'Then  he must be a noble beast indeed,' said Aragorn; 'and  it grieves  me more than many tidings that might seem worse to  learn that Sauron levies  such tribute. It was not so when last I was in that land.'       `Nor is it now, I  will swear,' said Boromir.  `It  is a lie that comes  from the Enemy.  I  know  the Men of Rohan;  true  a nd  valiant, our allies,   dwelling still in the lands that we gave them long ago.'       `The  shadow  of  Mordor  lies  on  distant lands,'  answered  Aragorn.  'Saruman has fallen under  it.  Rohan is beset. Who knows what you will find  there, if ever you return?'       `Not this at least.' said Boromir, 'that they will buy their lives with  horses. They  love  their horses next  to their kin. And not without reason,  for the horses of the Riddermark come from the fields of the North, far from  the Shadow. and their race, as  that of their masters, is descended from the  free days of old.'       'True indeed!'  said Gandalf. `And there is  one among them that  might  have been foaled in the morning of the world. The horses of  the Nine cannot  vie with him; tireless,   swift as the  flowing  wind."
