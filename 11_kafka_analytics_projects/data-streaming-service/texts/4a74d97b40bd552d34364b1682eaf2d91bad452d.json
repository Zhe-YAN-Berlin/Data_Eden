The Lady Galadriel said no word but looked long upon his face.       `Sit  now beside  my chair, Frodo of the Shire!  ' said Celeborn. `When  all have come we will speak together.'       Each of the companions he greeted courteously by name  as they entered.   `Welcome Aragorn son  of Arathorn! ' he said. `It is eight  and thirty years  of the world outside since you came to this land;  and those years lie heavy  on you. But the end is near, for good or ill. Here lay aside your burden for   a while! '       'Welcome son of Thranduil! Too seldom do my kindred journey hither from  the North.'       `Welcome Gimli  son of  Gluin!  It is long indeed since  we  saw one of  Durin's folk in Caras Galadhon. But today we have broken our  long  law. May  it be a sign that though  the world is now dark better days are at hand, and  that friendship shall be renewed between our peoples.' Gimli bowed low.       When all  the guests were seated before his chair   the  Lord  looked at  them again. 'Here there  are eight,' he said. `Nine were to set out: so said  the messages. But maybe  there has been some  change of counsel that we have  not heard. Elrond is far away, and darkness gathers between us, and all this  year the shadows have grown longer.'       `Nay, there was no change of counsel,' said the Lady Galadriel speaking  for the first time. Her voice was clear and musical, but deeper than woman's  wont. `Gandalf the Grey  set out  with the Company, but he did  not pass the  borders of this land.  Now tell us where he is; for  I much desired to speak  with him again. But  I cannot see him from afar,  unless he comes within the  fences of Lothlurien: a grey mist is about him, and the ways of his feet and  of his mind are hidden from me.'       'Alas! ' said Aragorn. `Gandalf the Grey fell into  shadow. He remained  in Moria and did not escape.'       At these words  all the  Elves in the  hall  cried aloud  in grief  and  amazement. `These are evil tidings,' said Celeborn, `the most evil that have  been spoken here in long years full of grievous deeds.' He turned to Haldir.  `Why  has nothing  of  this  been  told  to me before?  '  he  asked in  the  Elven-tongue.       'We  have  not spoken  to  Haldir of  our  deeds or our purpose,'  said  Legolas. `At  first  we were  weary and  danger  was  too close  behind  and   ####-afterwards we almost forgot our grief for a time,  as  we walked in gladness  on the fair paths of Lurien.'       `Yet our grief  is  great  and our loss  cannot be mended ,' said Frodo.  'Gandalf was our guide, and he led us  through  Moria; and when  our  escape  seemed beyond hope he saved us, and he fell.'       'Tell us now the full tale! ' said Celeborn:       Then  Aragorn  recounted  all  that  had  happened  upon  the  pass  of  Caradhras, and in  the  days that followed;  and  he spoke  of Balin and his  book, and the fight in the Chamber of Mazarbul, and the fire, and the narrow  bridge, and  the  coming of the Terror.  'An  evil  of  the Ancient World it  seemed,  such as  I have  never seen before,' said  Aragorn. `It  was both a   shadow and a flame, strong and terrible.'       'It was a Balrog of Morgoth,' said Legolas; `of  all elf-banes the most   deadly, save the One who sits in the Dark Tower.'       `Indeed I saw  upon  the bridge that  which haunts our darkest dreams l  saw Durin's Bane,' said Gimli in a low voice, and dread was in his eyes.       'Alas!  ' said Celeborn.  `We long have feared that  under Caradhras  a   terror slept.  But had  I known that the Dwarves had st irred up this evil in  Moria again,  l  would have forbidden you to pass the  northern borders, you   and all that went with you. And  if it were possible, one would  say that at  the last  Gandalf fell from wisdom into folly, going needlessly into the net  of Moria.'       `He would be rash indeed that said that thing,' said Galadriel gravely.  `Needless were none of the deeds of Gandalf in life. Those that followed him  knew not  his mind and cannot report his full purpose. But however it may be  with the  guide, the followers are blameless.  Do not repent of your welcome   to the Dwarf. If our folk had been exiled long  and far from Lothlurien, who  of the Galadhrim, even Celeborn the Wise, would pass nigh and would not  wish  to look upon their ancient home, though it  had become an abode of dragons?        'Dark  is  the  water  of  Kheled-zvram, and cold  are the  springs  of  Kibil-nvla,  and  fair were  the many-pillared halls  of Khazad-dym in Elder   Days before  the fall of mighty  kings beneath  the stone.' She looked  upon  Gimli, who sat glowering and sad, and she smiled. And the Dwarf, hearing the  names given in his own ancient tongue,  looked up and met her  eyes;  and it  seemed  to him that he looked  suddenly  into the heart of  an enemy and saw  there love and understanding. Wonder came into his face, and then  he smiled   ####-in answer."
