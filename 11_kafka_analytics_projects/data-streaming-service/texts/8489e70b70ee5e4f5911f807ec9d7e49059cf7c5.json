'Why it is better than  the honey-cakes of  the Beornings,  and  that  is great praise,  for the Beornings  are the best  bakers that I know of; but they are none too willing to deal out their cakes  to travellers in these days. You are kindly hosts! '       'All the same, we bid you spare the food,' they  said. 'Eat little at a   time,  and only at need. For these things  are given to  serve  you when all   else fails.  The  cakes  will keep sweet  for  many many  days, if  they are  unbroken and left in their leaf-wrappings, as we have brought them. One will  keep a traveller on his feet for a day of  long labour, even if he be one of  the tall Men of Minas Tirith.'       The  Elves next unwrapped  and gave to each  of the Company the clothes  they  had  brought.  For  each they  had  provided a  hood  and cloak,  made  according to his size, of the light but warm silken stuff that the Galadhrim  wove. It was  hard to say of what  colour they were:  grey with  the hue  of  twilight under  the trees they seemed  to be; and yet if they were moved, or   set in another light, they were green as shadowed leaves, or brown as fallow  fields by  night, dusk -silver  as  water under  the  stars. Each  cloak  was  fastened about the neck with a brooch like a green leaf veined with silver.       `Are these magic cloaks? ' asked Pippin, looking at them with wonder.       `I do  not  know what you mean by  that,' answered  the  leader  of the  Elves. `They are fair garments, and the web is good, for it was made in this  land. They are elvish robes certainly, if that is what  you  mean. Leaf  and   branch, water and  stone: they have the hue and beauty  of all  these things  under the twilight of Lurien that we  love; for  we  put the thought of  all  that we love into all that  we make. Yet they  are garments, not armour, and  they  will not turn shaft or blade. But they should serve you well: they are  light to wear, and warm enough  or cool enough at  need.  And  you will find  them a great aid in keeping out of the sight of unfriendly eyes, whether you    ####-walk among the stones or the trees. You are indeed high in the favour of the  Lady! For she herself and her maidens wove this stuff; and never before have  we clad strangers in the garb of our own people.'       After  their morning meal the Company said farewell to  the lawn by the  fountain.  Their  hearts  were  heavy;  for it was a fair  place, and it had  become like home to  them,  though they could not count the days and  nights  that they had passed there. As they stood for a moment looking at the  white  water in the sunlight, Haldir came walking towards them over the green grass  of the glade. Frodo greeted him with delight.       'I have  returned from the  Northern  Fences,'  said the Elf, `and I am  sent  now  to be your guide again.  The Dimrill Dale is  full of vapour  and  clouds of  smoke,  and the  mountains are troubled. There are noises in  the  deeps  of the  earth. If any of you had thought  of returning northwards  to  your homes, you would not have been able to pass  that  way. But come!  Your  path now goes south.'       As they walked through Caras Galadhon the green ways were empty; but in  the trees above them many voices were murmuring and singing. They  themselves  went  silently. At last Haldir  led them down the  southward  slopes  of the  hill, and they came again  to  the great  gate hung with  lamps, and to  the  white  bridge; and so they  passed out and left the city of the Elves.  Then  they turned  away from the paved road  and took  a path that went off into a   deep  thicket  of  mallorn-trees,  and passed  on,  winding through  rolling  woodlands  of  silver  shadow,  leading   them  ever  down,  southwards  and  eastwards, towards the shores of the River.       They had gone  some ten miles and noon  was at hand when they came on a   high green  wall. Passing through  an opening they came  suddenly out of the  trees. Before them  lay a  long  lawn of shining grass, studded  with golden  elanor  that  glinted  in the sun.  The lawn ran  out  into a narrow  tongue  between  bright margins:  on  the  right  and  west  the  Silverlode  flowed  glittering; on the left and  east the Great River  rolled its broad  waters,  deep and  dark.  On  the  further  shores the  woodlands  still  marched  on  southwards as far as the eye could see, but  all the banks  were  bleak  and  bare. No mallorn lifted its gold-hung boughs beyond the Land of Lurien.       On  the bank of the Silverlode, at some distance up from the meeting of  the  streams,  there was a hythe of white stones and  white wood. By it were  moored many boats and  barges.  Some were  brightly painted, and shone  with   ####-silver and gold  and green, but most were either  white or grey."
