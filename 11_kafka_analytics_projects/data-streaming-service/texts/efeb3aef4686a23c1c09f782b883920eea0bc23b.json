It  vanished, and Frodo sighed and prepared to draw away.       But suddenly the Mirror went altogether dark, as dark as  if a hole had  opened in the world  of sight, and Frodo looked into emptiness. In the black   abyss there appeared a single Eye  that slowly grew. until it  filled nearly  all  the  Mirror. So terrible was it that Frodo stood rooted, unable to  cry  out  or  to withdraw his gaze. The Eye was rimmed with fire, but  was itself  glazed, yellow as a cat's, watchful  and  intent, and  the black slit of its  pupil opened on a pit, a window into nothing.       Then the Eye began to rove, searching this way and that; and Frodo knew  with certainty  and  horror that  among  the  many things that it sought  he  himself  was one. But  he also knew that  it could not see him-not yet,  not  unless he willed it. The Ring that hung upon its  chain  about his neck grew  heavy, heavier than a great stone,  and his  head was dragged downwards. The  Mirror  seemed  to be growing hot and  curls  of steam were rising  from the  water. He was slipping forward.       `Do not touch the water!' said the  Lady  Galadriel softly. The  vision  faded,  and Frodo found that he was  looking  at the cool stars twinkling in  the silver basin. He stepped back shaking all over and looked at the Lady.       `I know what it was that you  last saw,' she said; `for that is also in  my mind. Do not be  afraid! But do  not think that only by singing  amid the  trees, nor  even by  the  slender arrows of  elven-bows,  is  this  land  of  Lothlurien maintained and defended against its  Enemy. I say  to you, Frodo,  that  even as I speak to you, I perceive the Dark Lord and know his mind, or   all of his mind that concerns the Elves. And he gropes ever to see me and my   ####-thought. But still the door is closed! '       She lifted up her white arms, and spread out her hands towards the East  in a  gesture of  rejection  and  denial. Edrendil, the Evening  Star,  most   beloved of the Elves, shone clear above. So bright was it that the figure of  the Elven-lady cast a dim shadow on the ground. Its rays glanced upon a ring  about  her  finger; it  glittered like  polished  gold overlaid  with silver  light, and a white stone in it twinkled as if the Even -star had come down to  rest upon her hand. Frodo gazed at the ring with awe; for suddenly it seemed   to him that he understood.       `Yes,' she said, divining his thought, `it is not permitted to speak of  it,  and  Elrond  could  not  do  so.  But  it  cannot  be  hidden from  the  Ring-bearer,  and  one who has seen  the Eye.  Verily it is in the  land  of  Lurien upon  the finger of Galadriel  that one of the Three remains. This is  Nenya, the Ring of Adamant, and I am its keeper.       `He suspects, but  he  does not  know  --  not  yet. Do you not see now  wherefore your  coming is to us as  the footstep  of  Doom? For if you fail,  then we are  laid  bare to the Enemy.  Yet if you succeed, then our power is  diminished, and Lothlurien will fade, and the  tides  of  Time will sweep it  away. We must depart into the  West, or dwindle to a rustic folk of dell  and  cave, slowly to forget and to be forgotten.'       Frodo bent his head. `And what do you wish? ' he said at last.       `That  what should be shall be,' she answered.  `The love of the  Elves  for  their land  a nd  their works is deeper than the deeps of  the Sea,  and  their regret  is  undying and cannot ever  wholly be assuaged. Yet they will  cast all away rather than submit to Sauron: for they know him  now.  For the  fate of Lothlurien you are not answerable but only for the doing of your own   task. Yet I  could wish, were it of any avail, that the One  Ring had  never  been wrought, or had remained for ever lost.'       'You are wise  and fearless  and fair, Lady  Galadriel,' said Frodo. `I   will give  you the One Ring, if you ask for it. It is too great a matter for   me.'       Galadriel laughed  with a sudden clear laugh. `Wise the  Lady Galadriel  may be,' she said, `yet here she has met her match in  courtesy. Gently  are  you revenged for my testing of your heart at our first meeting. You begin to   see with a keen eye. I do not deny that my heart has greatly desired to  ask   what you offer. For many long  years I  had pondered what I might do, should  the  Great  Ring come  into my hands, and behold!  it was brought  within my   ####-grasp. The evil that was devised long ago  works on  in many  ways,  whether  Sauron himself stands or falls. Would not that have been a noble deed to set   to the credit of his Ring, if I had taken it by force or fear from my guest?        `And now a t last  it comes. You will give me the Ring  freely! In place   of  the Dark Lord  you will set up  a  Queen. And I shall  not  be dark, but  beautiful and terrible as the Morning and the Night! Fair as the Sea and the  Sun and the Snow upon the Mountain! Drea dful as the Storm and the  Lightning!   Stronger than the foundations of the earth."
