  "text": "        `Yes? Now Boromir you would say?  ' said Faramir. `What would  you say?   He took his peril with him? '       `Yes sir, begging your pardon, and a  fine man as your brother was if I  may say  so.  But  you've  been  warm on  the scent all along. Now I watched  Boromir  and listened to him, from Rivendell  all down the  road --  looking   after my master, as you'll understand,  and not meaning any harm to  Boromir  -- and it's my  opinion that  in Lurien he first  saw clearly what I guessed  sooner: what  he  wanted.  From the  moment he  first  saw it he  wanted the  Enemy's Ring! '       `Sam!  '  cried Frodo  aghast. He had fallen deep into his own thoughts  for a while, and came out of them suddenly and too late.       'Save me! ' said Sam turning white, and then flushing scarlet. `There I  go  again!  When ever  you open your big mouth you put your foot  in it  the  Gaffer used to say to me, and right enough. O dear, O dear!       `Now look here,  sir!  ' He turned, facing up  to Faramir with  all the  courage  that he  could muster. `Don't you go taking advantage of my  master  because his servant's no better than a fool. You've spoken very handsome all   along,  put me off my  guard,  talking of Elves and all. But  handsome is as  handsome does we say. Now's a chance to show your quality.'       'So  it seems,' said Faramir,  slowly and  very  softly, with a strange  smile.  `So that  is the answer  to all the riddles! The One Ring  that  was  thought to  have perished  fr om  the world. And Boromir tried to take  it by  force? And you escaped? And ran all the way -- to me! And here in the wild I  have  you:  two halflings,  and a host of men at  my  call, and the  Ring of  Rings. A pretty stroke of fortune!  A chance for Faramir, Captain of Gondor,  to show his quality! Ha!'  He stood up,  very tall and stern, his  grey eyes  glinting.       Frodo and Sam sprang from their stools and set themselves  side by side  with their backs  to the wall, fumbling for their sword-hilts.  There was  a  silence.  All the men in the cave stopped talking and looked towards them in  wonder. But Faramir sat down  again in his chair and began to laugh quietly,   and then suddenly became grave again.       'Alas  for Boromir! It was too sore a trial!  ' he said. `How you  have  increased my sorrow, you two  strange wanderers from a  far country, bearing  the peril of Men! But you are less judges of Men than I of Halflings. We are  truth-speakers, we men  of Gondor. We boast seldom, and then perform, or die   ####-in the attempt. Not if  I found it  on the  highway would I take it  I said.  Even if I were such a man as  to desire this thing, and  even though I  knew  not clearly what  this thing was  when  I spoke, still I should  take  those  words as a vow, and be held by them.       'But I am not such a man. Or I am wise enough  to  know that  there are  some  perils from which a  man  must  flee.  Sit at peace! And be comforted,  Samwise. If  you seem to have stumbled, think  that it was  fated to  be so.  Your heart is shr ewd as  well  as  faithful, and saw clearer than your eyes.   For  strange though it  may seem,  it was safe to declare this to me. It may  even help the  master that you love. It shall turn to his good, if it is  in  my power. So be comforted. But do not even name this thing again aloud. Once  is enough.'       The hobbits came back  to  their seats and sat very  quiet. Men  turned  back to  their drink and their talk, perceiving  that their captain had  had  some jest or other with the little guests, and that it was over.       'Well, Frodo, now at last we understand one another,' said Faramir. 'If  you took this thing on yourself, unwilling, at others' asking, then you have  pity and honour from me. And I marvel at you: to keep  it hid and not to use  it.  You  are a   new people and a new world to me. Are  all your kin of like  sort? Your  land  must  be a realm  of peace  and content,  and  there  must   gardeners be in high honour.'       `Not all  is  well  there,'  said Frodo, `but  certainly gardeners  are  honoured.'       `But folk  must  grow weary  there, even  in their  gardens, as  do all  things under the Sun  of this world. And you are far from  home and wayworn.  No more tonight. Sleep, both  of you -- in peace, if you can. Fear not! I do  not wish to  see it, or  touch  it, or know more of it than I know (which is  enough), lest peril perchance waylay  me and I  fall lower  in the test than  Frodo son of Drogo. Go now to rest -- but  first tell  me only, if you will,  whither you wish to go,  and  what  to do.  For I  must watch, and  wait, and  think.  Time passes.  In the morning  we  must each  go swiftly  on the ways  appointed to us.'       Frodo had felt himself trembling as the first shock of fear passed. Now  a great  weariness came  down on him like  a  cloud. He could dissemble  and  resist no longer.       'I was going to find a way into Mordor,' he said faintly."
