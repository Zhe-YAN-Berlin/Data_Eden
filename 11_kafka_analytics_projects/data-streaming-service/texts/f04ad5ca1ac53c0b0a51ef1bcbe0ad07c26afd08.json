The hearts  of the hobbits rose again a little in spite of weariness: the  air was fresh  and  fragrant, and it reminded them  of the uplands of the Northfarthing far  away. It seemed good to be reprieved, to  walk in a land that had  only been  for a few years  under the dominion of  the Dark Lord and was not yet fallen  wholly into  decay. But they did not forget their danger, nor the Black Gate  that was still all too near, hidden though it was behind the gloomy heights.  They looked about for a hiding-place where they could shelter from evil eyes  while the light lasted.       The  day passed uneasily. They lay deep  in the heather and counted out  the  slow hours, in which  there seemed  little  change; for they were still  under the shadows of the Ephel D®ath, and the sun was veiled. Frodo slept at  times, deeply and peacefully, either trusting Gollum or too tired to trouble  about him; but Sam found it difficult to do more than doze, even when Gollum  was plainly fast  asleep,  whiffling  and twitching in  his  secret  dreams.   Hunger,  perhaps,  more than mistrust kept him wakeful: he had begun to long  for a good homely meal, `something hot out of the pot'.       As soon as the land faded into a formless grey under coming night, they  started  out  again. In  a little while  Gollum led  them  down  on  to  the  southward road; and after that they went  on more quickly, though the danger  was greater. Their ears were strained  for the sound of hoof or  foot on the  road  ahead, or following them  from behind;  but the night passed, and they  heard no sound of walker or rider.       The  road had been made in  a long lost  time:  and  for perhaps thirty  miles below  the  Morannon it had been  newly repaired, but as it went south   the wild encroached upon it. The handiwork of Men of old could still be seen  in its straight sure  flight and level course:  now and again it cut its way  through hillside slopes, or leaped over a stream upon a wide shapely arch of  enduring masonry; but at  last  all signs  of stonework faded,  save  for  a   broken pillar  here and  there,  peering out of bushes  at  the side, or old  paving-stones still  lurking  amid weeds  and  moss.  Heather  and  trees and  bracken  scrambled down  and  overhung  the banks, or sprawled out over  the  surface. It dwindled at last to a country cart -road little  used; but it did  not wind:  it held on its  own sure course and  guided them by  the swiftest    ####-way.       So  they  passed into the  northern marches  of that land that Men once  called Ithilien, a fair country of climbing woods and swift -falling streams.   The  night  became  fine  under  star and round moon, and  it seemed  to the  hobbits that the  fragrance  of the air grew as they went  forward; and from  the  blowing and muttering of Gollum it  seemed that he noticed it  too, and  did not relish it. At the first signs  of day  they halted  again.  They had  come to the end of a long cutting, deep, and sheer -sided in  the middle,  by  which the road clove its way through a stony  ridge. Now they climbed up the  westward bank and looked abroad.       Day  was  opening in the sky, and they saw  that the mountains were now   much further  off, receding ea stward in  a long curve  that was lost in  the  distance. Before them, as they turned west, gentle slopes ran  down into dim  hazes far  below. All about them were small woods of resinous trees, fir and  cedar  and cypress. and other  kinds  unknown in the Shire, with wide glades  among them; and  everywhere there was a wealth  of sweet -smelling  herbs and  shrubs. The long journey from Rivendell had brought them far south of  their  own  land,  but not until now in this more sheltered region had the  hobbits  felt the change of clime.  Here Spring was  already busy about them:  fronds  pierced  moss  and mould,  larches were  green-fingered, small flowers  were  opening in the turf,  birds were singing. Ithilien, the garden of Gondor now  desolate kept still a dishevelled dryad loveliness.        South  and  west  it looked  towards  the  warm lower vales  of Anduin,  shielded  from   the  east  by  the  Ephel  D®ath  and  yet  not  under  the  mountain-shadow,  protected  from the north  by the  Emyn Muil, open  to the  southern  airs and the moist winds from the Sea far  away.  Many great trees  grew there,  planted  long ago,  falling  into untended age amid a  riot  of  careless descendants;  and groves and  thickets there  were of tamarisk  and  pungent terebinth, of olive and of bay; and there were junipers and myrtles;  and  thymes that grew in  bushes, or with their woody creeping stems mantled  in deep tapestries the hidden stones; sages of many kinds putting forth blue  flowers, or  red,  or pale green; and  marjorams and new-sprouting parsleys,   and many  herbs of forms and scents beyond the garden-lore of Sam."
