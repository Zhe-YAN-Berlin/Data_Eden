Long  have  its vast mansions lain   ####-empty since the  children of Durin fled. But now we  spoke of  it again with   longing, and yet with  dread;  for  no dwarf has dared to pass  the doors of  Khazad-dym  for many  lives of kings, save Thrur only, and  he  perished. At  last, however,  Balin  listened to  the whispers,  and resolved   to  go; and  though Dbin did not  give leave willingly, he took with him  Ori and Uin and  many of our folk, and they went away south.       \"That  was  nigh  on thirty  years ago. For a while we had  news and it  seemed good: messages reported that Moria ha d been entered and a great  work  begun there.  Then there was silence,  and  no word has ever come from Moria   since.       \"Then  about  a  year  ago  a  messenger came  to Dbin,  but  not  from  Moria -from Mordor: a horseman in the night, who called Dbin to his gate. The  Lord Sauron the Great, so he said, wished for our friendship. Rings he would  give for  it, such  as he gave  of  old.  And he  asked urgently  concerning  hobbits, of what kind they were, and where they dwelt.  \"For Sauron  knows,\"  said he, \"that one of these was known to you on a time.\"       'At this we were greatly troubled, and we gave no answer. And  then his  fell  voice was lowered,  and he  would have sweetened it if he could. \"As a   small token only of your friendship  Sauron asks this,\"  he  said: \"that you   should find this thief,\" such  was  his word, \"and get from him, willing  or   no, a  little  ring, the least of  rings,  that  once he stole. It  is but a   trifle that Sauron fancies, and an earnest of your good  will.  Find it, and  three rings that the Dwarf sires possessed of old shall be  returned to you,  and the realm of Moria shall be yours for ever. Find only news of the thief,   whether  he  still lives  and where,  and you  shall  have great  reward and  lasting friendship from the Lord. Refuse,  and things will not seem so well.  Do you refuse?\"       'At that his breath came like  the hiss of snakes, and all who stood by  shuddered, but  Dbin said: \"I say neither yea nor  nay. I must consider this  message and what it means under its fair cloak.\"       ' \"Consider well, but not too long,\" said he.       ` \"The time of my thought is my own to spend,\" answered Dbin.       ' \"For the present,\" said he, and rode into the darkness.        'Heavy have the  hearts  of our  chieftains  been since that  night. We  needed not the fell voice of  the messenger to  warn us that his  words held  both  menace  and  deceit; for  we knew  already that  the  power  that  has  re-entered Mordor has not changed, and ever it betrayed us of old. Twice the   ####-messenger has returned, and has gone unanswered. The third and last time, so  he says, is soon to come, before the ending of the year.       'And so I  have been  sent at last by Dbin  to warn  Bilbo  that  he is  sought by the Enemy, and to learn, if may be, why he desires this ring, this  least of rings. Also we crave the advice of Elrond. For the Shadow grows and  draws nearer.  We discover that messengers  have come also to King  Brand in  Dale,  and  that he is  afraid. We  fear  that he may yield. Already war  is  gathering on  his eastern borders.  If we make no answer, the Enemy may move  Men of his rule to assail King Brand, and Dbin also.'       `You  have done well to come,' said Elrond.  `You will  hear today  all  that you need in order to  understand  the purposes of the  Enemy. There  is  naught that you can do, other than to resist, with hope or without  it.  But  you do not stand alone. You will learn that your  trouble is but part of the  trouble of all the western world. The Ring! What shall we do  with the Ring,  the least of rings, the trifle that Sauron fancies? That is the doom that we  must deem.       `That is the  purpose for which you are  called hither. Called, I  say.  though  I have not called you to me, strangers from distant lands. You  have  come and are here met, in this very nick  of time, by chance as it may seem.   Yet it  is not so. Believe rather that it is  so ordered  that  we, who  sit  here, and none others, must now find counsel for the peril of the world.       `Now, therefore, things  shall be  openly spoken that  have been hidden  from all  but a few  until this  day. And first, so that all  may understand  what is the  peril, the  Tale  of the Ring shall be told  from the beginning  even  to this present.  And I will begin that tale, though others  shall end  it.'       Then all listened while  Elrond in his clear voice  spoke of Sauron and  the Rings of Power,  and  their forging in the  Second Age of the world long  ago. A part of his tale was known to some there, but the full  tale to none,  and  many eyes were turned  t= Elrond in  fear and wonder as he  told of the  Elven-smiths of Eregion and their friendship with Moria, and their eagerness  for knowledge,  by which Sauron ensnared them."
