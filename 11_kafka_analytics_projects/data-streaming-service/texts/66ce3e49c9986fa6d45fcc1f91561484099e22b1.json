Distant but deep there came up on the wind a  roaring sound  like the roll of thunder heard far away.   ####-     `Behold Tol Brandir! ' said Aragorn,  pointing south to  the tall peak.  'Upon the left stands Amon Lhaw, and upon the right is Amon Hen the Hills of  Hearing and of Sight. In the days  of the  great kings there were high seats  upon  them, and watch was kept there. But it is said that no foot of  man or  beast has ever been set upon Tol Brandir. Ere  the shade of  night  falls we  shall come to them. I hear the endless voice of Rauros calling.'       The Company rested now for a while,  drifting south on the current that  flowed through the middle  of  the lake. They  ate  some food, and then they  took  to their paddles and  hastened on their way. The sides of the westward  hills fell into shadow, and  the Sun  grew round and  red.  Here and there a   misty  star peered out. The three peaks loomed before  them, darkling in the  twilight. Rauros was roaring with a grea t voice.  Already  night was laid on  the flowing waters when the travellers came at  last under the shadow of the  hills.       The tenth  day of their journey  was over.  Wilderland was behind them.  They could go no further without choice between the  east -way and  the west.  The last stage of the Quest was before them.     ####-   Chapter 10. The Breaking of the Fellowship            Aragorn led them to  the right  arm of the River. Here upon its western  side under the shadow of Tol Brandir a green lawn ran down to the water from  the feet of Amon Hen.  Behind it rose the first gentle  slopes  of  the hill  clad with trees, and trees marched away westward along the curving shores of  the lake. A little spring fell tumbling down and fed the grass.        'Here  we will rest tonight,' said Aragorn. `This is the lawn  of Parth  Galen: a fair place in the summer days of old. Let us hope  that no evil has  yet come here.'       They drew up their boats on the green banks, and  beside them they made   their camp.  They set  a watch, but had no sight nor sound of their enemies.   If Gollum had contrived  to follow  them,  he  remained  unseen and unheard.  Nonetheless as the night  wore on Aragorn grew uneasy, tossing often in  his  sleep and waking. In the small hours he got up and came to Frodo, whose turn  it was to watch.       `Why are you waking? ' asked Frodo. `It is not your watch.'       `I do  not know,' answered Aragorn; `but a shadow and a threat has been  growing in my sleep. It would be well to draw your sword.'       `Why? ' said Frodo. `Are enemies at hand? '       `Let us see what Sting may show,' answered Aragorn.       Frodo  then drew the elf-blade from its sheath. To his dismay the edges  gleamed  dimly in  the night. `Orcs! ' he said. `Not very  near, and yet too  near, it seems.'       `I feared as much,' said Aragorn. `But maybe they are  not on this side  of the River. The light of  Sting is faint, and it may point to no more than  spies of Mordor  roaming on the  slopes  of  Amon  Lhaw.  I have never heard  before of Orcs  upon Amon Hen. Yet who  knows what may happen in  these  evil  days, now  that Minas Tirith no longer holds secure the passages of  Anduin.   We must go warily tomorrow.'       The day came like fire and smoke. Low in the East there were black bars  of cloud  like the fumes of a great burning. The  rising  sun  lit them from  beneath  with flames of  murky red; but  soon  it climbed above  them into a   clear sky. The summit of Tol Brandir was tipped with  gold. Frodo looked out   ####-eastward and  gazed at the tall island.  Its  si des  sprang sheer out of the  running  water. High up above the  tall cliffs were  steep slopes upon which  trees climbed, mounting  one  head above another; and  above them again were  grey  faces of inaccessible rock, crowned by  a great spire  of  stone. Many  birds were  circling  about it, but no sign of  other living things could be  seen.       When they had eaten, Aragorn called the Company together. `The  day has  come at last,' he said: 'the day of choice which we have  long delayed. What  shall  now become  of our Company that has  travelled  so far in fellowship?   Shall we turn  west with  Boromir and go to the wars of Gondor; or turn east   to the Fear and Shadow; or shall we break our fellowship and go this way and  that as each may choose? Whatever  we do  must  be done soon. We  cannot  long  halt here. The  enemy is on the eastern shore, we know; but I  fear that the  Orcs may already be on this side of the water.'       There was a long silence in which no one spoke or moved.       'Well,  Frodo,'  said Aragorn at last. `I fear that  the burden is laid  upon  you. You are the  Bearer  appointed by the  Council. Your  own way you   alone  can choose. In this matter I cannot advise you."
