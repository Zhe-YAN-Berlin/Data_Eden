'We are the Uruk-hai:  we  do not stop   the fight for night or day, for fair  weather or for storm. We come to kill,  by sun or moon. What of the dawn?'       'None knows what the  new day shall bring him,' said  Aragorn. 'Get you    ####-gone, ere it turn to your evil.'       'Get down or  we will shoot you from the wall,' they cried. 'This is no  parley. You have nothing to say.'       'I have still this to say,' answered Aragorn. 'No  enemy has  yet taken  the Hornburg. Depart, or not one of you will be spared. Not one will be left  alive to take back tidings to the North. You do not know your peril.'       So great a power and royalty was revealed in Aragorn, as he stood there  alone  above the ruined gates before  the host of  his  enemies, that many of  the wild men paused, and looked back over their shoulders to the valley, and   some looked up doubtfully at the sky. But the Orcs laughed with loud voices;  and a  hail of darts and arrows whistled over  the  wall, as  Aragorn leaped  down.       There  was a roar and a blast of  fire. The archway  of the gate  above  which he had stood a moment before crumbled and crashed  in smoke  and  dust.  The  barricade was  scattered as if  by  a thunderbolt. Aragorn  ran to  the  king's tower.       But even as the gate fell, and the Orcs  about it yelled,  preparing to  charge, a murmur arose behind them. like a wind in the distance, and it grew  to a clamour of many voices crying strange news  in the dawn.  The Orcs upon  the Rock, hearing the  rumour of dismay, wavered and looked back.  And then,  sudden and terrible, from the  tower above, the sound  of the great horn  of  Helm rang out.       All that heard that sound trembled. Many of the Orcs cast themselves on  their faces and covered their ears  with their claws. Back from the Deep the  echoes came, blast upon blast, as if on every cliff and hill a mighty herald  stood. But on the walls men looked up, listening with wonder; for the echoes  did not die. Ever the  horn-blasts wound on among the hills; nearer now  and   louder they answered one to another, blowing fierce and free.       'Helm!  Helm!' the Riders  shouted.  'Helm is arisen  and comes back to  war. Helm for Thjoden King!'       And with that shout the king came. His horse  was white as snow, golden  was  his shield,  and his  spear was long. At his  right  hand  was Aragorn,  Elendil's  heir, behind him rode the lords of the  House of Eorl the  Young.  Light sprang in the sky. Night departed.       'Forth Eorlingas!' With a cry and a great noise they charged. Down from  the gates they roared, over the causeway they swept, and they drove  through   ####-the hosts of Isengard as a wind among grass. Behind them  from the Deep came  the stern cries of' men issuing from the caves, driving forth the enemy. Out  poured  all the men that were left upon  the Rock.  And  ever the  sound  of  blowing horns echoed in the hills.        On they rode, the king and his companions. Captains  and champions fell   or fled before them. Neither orc nor man withstood them. Their backs were to  the swords  and  spears of the Riders and their  faces to  the  valley. They  cried  and  wailed,  for fear and great wonder had  come upon  them with the   rising of the day.       So King Thjoden rode from Helm's Gate and clove his path to  the  great  Dike. There the company  halted. Light grew bright about them. Shafts of the  sun flared above the  eastern hills and  glimmered on their spears. But they  sat silent on their horses, and they gazed down upon the Deeping-coomb.       The land had changed. Where before the green dale had  lain, its grassy  slopes lapping  the ever -mounting hills,  there  now a forest  loomed. Great  trees, bare and  silent,  stood, rank on  rank, with tangled bough and hoary  head;  their twisted roots were buried in the long green grass. Darkness was  under them. Between the  Dike and the eaves of that  nameless wood only  two  open furlongs lay.  There now cowered  the proud hosts of Saruman, in terror  of the  king and in terror of the trees. They streamed down from Helm's Gate  until all above the Dike was  empty  of them, but below it they were  packed  like swarming flies.  Vainly they crawled and clambered about  the walls  of  the coomb. seeking to escape.  Upon the  east  too sheer and stony  was  the  valley's side; upon the left, from the west, their final doom approached.       There suddenly upon a ridge appeared a rider, clad in white, shining in  the rising  sun.  Over  the low hills  the horns were  sounding. Behind him,  hastening down the long slopes,  were a  thousand  men on foot; their swords  were in their hands. Amid them strode a man tall and strong.  His shield was  red. As he came to the valley's brink, he set to his lips a great black horn  and blew a ringing blast.       'Erkenbrand!' the Riders shouted. 'Erkenbrand!'       'Behold the White Rider!' cried Aragorn."
