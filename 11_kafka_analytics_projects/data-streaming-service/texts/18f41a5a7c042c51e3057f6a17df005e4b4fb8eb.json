  "text": " Fangorn is  my name according to  some,  Treebeard others make it. Treebeard will do.'       'An Ent?' said  Merry.  'What's  that? But  what do you  call yourself?   What's your real name?'       'Hoo now!' replied  Treebeard. 'Hoo! Now that would be  telling! Not so  hasty.  And I  am doing the  asking. You are  in my country. What are you,  I   wonder? I cannot place you. You do not  seem to come in the old lists that I   learned when I was young. But  that was a long, long time ago, and  they may  have made new lists. Let me see! Let me see! How did it go?        Learn now the lore of Living Creatures!       First name the four, the free peoples:       Eldest of all, the elf-children;       Dwarf the delver, dark are his houses;       Ent the earthborn, old as mountains;   ####-     Man the mortal, master of horses:       Hm, hm, hm.       Beaver the builder, buck the leaper,       Bear bee-hunter, boar the fighter;       Hound is hungry, hare is fearful...       hm, hm.       Eagle in eyrie, ox in pasture,       Hart horn-crowned; hawk is swiftest       Swan the whitest, serpent coldest...       Hoom, hm; hoom. hm. how did it go? Room tum, room tum, roomty toom  tum.  It was a long list. But anyway you do not seem to fit in anywhere!'       'We  always seem  to have got   left out of the  old lists, and the  old  stories,' said  Merry.  'Yet we've been about for quite a long  time.  We're  hobbits.'       'Why not make a new line?' said Pippin.       'Half-grown hobbits, the hole -dwellers.       Put us in amongst the four, next to Man (the Big People) and you've got  it.'       'Hm! Not bad, not bad,' said Treebeard.  'That would do. So you live in  holes, eh? It  sounds very right and proper. Who calls  you hobbits, though?   That does not sound elvish to me. Elves made all  the old   words: they began  it.'       'Nobody else calls us hobbits; we call ourselves that,' said Pippin.       'Hoom, hmm! Come  now!  Not so hasty!  You call yourselves hobbits? But  you should not go telling just anybody. You'll be letting out your own right  names if you're not careful.'       'We aren't careful about  that,' said Merry. 'As a matter of fact I'm a   Brandybuck, Meriadoc Brandybuck, though most people call me just Merry.'       'And I'm a Took, Peregrin Took,  but  I'm generally called  Pippin,  or   even Pip.'       'Hm, but you are hasty folk, I see,' said Treebeard. 'I  am honoured by  your confidence; but you should not be too free all at once.  There are Ents  and  Ents, you know; or there  are Ents and things that look like  Ents  but  ain't, as you  might say. I'll call you  Merry and Pippin if you please-nice  names. For I am not going to tell you my name, not yet at any rate.' A queer   half-knowing,  half-humorous look came with  a green flicker into his  eyes.    ####-'For one thing it would  take a long while: my name is growing all the time,  and I've lived a  very  long, long time; so my  name is like  a story.  Real  names tell you the story of the things they belong to in my language, in the  Old  Entish  as you might say. It is a lovely  language, but it takes a very  long  time to say  anything in it, because  we do  not  say anything  in it.  unless it is worth taking a long time to say, and to listen to.       'But  now,' and  the  eyes became very bright and 'present', seeming to  grow smaller and almost sharp, 'what is  going  on? What are you doing in it   all? I can see and hear  (and smell and feel) a great deal from  this,  from  this, from this  a-lalla-lalla-rumba-kamanda-lind-or-burÂ®ml. Excuse me: that  is a part of my name for it; I do not know what  the word is  in the outside  languages: you know, the thing we are on, where I stand and look out on fine  mornings, and  think about  the Sun, and the grass beyond the wood,  and the  horses, and the clouds, and the  unfolding of the world. What  is going  on?   What is Gandalf up  to? And these -- burbrum,' he made a deep rumbling noise  like a discord on a great organ --  'these Orcs, and young Saruman  down  at  Isengard? I like news. But not too quick now.'       'There is quite a lot going on,' said Merry:  'and even if we tried  to  be quick, it  would  take a  long time to tell.  But you  told  us not to be  hasty. Ought we to tell you anything so soon? Would you think it rude, if we   asked what you are  going to do with us, and  which side you are on? And did  you know Gandalf?'       'Yes, I do know  him: the only wizard that really cares  about  trees '  said Treebeard. 'Do you know him?'       'Yes,'  said Pippin  sadly, 'we did. He  was a great friend, and he was  our guide.'       'Then I  can answer your other  questions,' said  Treebeard. 'I  am not  going to do anything with you: not if you mean by that 'do something  to you '  without your  leave. We might  do  some things together. I don't  know about  sides. I go my own way; but your way may go along with mine for a while. But  you speak of Master  Gandalf,  as if he was  in a story that had come  to an  end."
