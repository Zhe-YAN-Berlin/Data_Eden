  "text": " The legend of Bilbo's gold excited both  curiosity  and  hope;  for legendary  gold  (mysteriously obtained,  if  not   positively ill-gotten), is, as every  one  knows, any one's for  the  finding   ####--unless the search is interrupted.       When he had overcome  Sancho and  pushed him out, Frodo  collapsed on a   chair in the hall. It's time to  close the shop, Merry,'  he said. 'Lock the  door, and don't open it to anyone today,  not even if they bring a battering  ram.' Then he went to revive himself with a belated cup of tea.       He had hardly sat down, when there came a soft knock at the front-door.  'Lobelia again most likely,' he thought. 'She must have thought of something  really nasty, and have come back again to say it. It can wait.'       He went on  with his tea.  The knock was repeated,  much louder, but he  took no notice. Suddenly the wizard's head appeared at the window.        'If you don't let me in, Frodo, I  shall blow your door right down your  hole and out through the hill,' he said.       'My dear Gandalf! Half a  minute!' cried Frodo, running out of the room  to the door. 'Come in! Come in! I thought it was Lobelia.'       'Then I  forgive you.  But I saw her some time ago, driving a pony-trap  towards Bywater with a face that would have curdled new milk.'       'She had already nearly curdled me. Honestly, I nearly tried on Bilbo's  ring. I longed to disappear.'       'Don't do that!'  said  Gandalf, sitting down. 'Do be  careful of  that  ring, Frodo! In fact, it is partly about that that I have come to say a last  word.'       'Well, what about it?'       'What do you know already?'       'Only  what Bilbo told me. I have heard his story: how he found it, and  how he used it: on his journey, I mean.'       'Which story, I wonder,' said Gandalf.        'Oh, not what he told the dwarves and put in his book,' said Frodo. 'He  told me  the  true story  soon after I  came to live here.  He said  you had  pestered him till he told you, so I had better know too. \"No secrets between  us,  Frodo,\"  he  said;  \"but  they are not  to go  any  further. It's  mine  anyway.\"'       'That's interesting,' said Gandalf.  'Well,  what did  you  think of it  all?'       'If you mean, inventing all that about a \"present\",  well, I thought the  true story much more likely, and I  couldn't see the point of altering it at  all. It was very  unlike Bilbo to do  so,  anyway; and I thought  it  rather   odd.'   ####-     'So did I. But odd things may happen to people that have such treasures  - if  they use them. Let it be a warning to you to be very careful  with it.  It may have other powers than just making you vanish when you wish to.'       'I don't understand,' said Frodo.       'Neither do I,'  answered  the wizard. 'I have  merely begun  to wonder   about the ring,  especially since last night. No need to worry.  But if  you   take my  advice you will use it very  seldom, or not at  all. At least I beg  you not  to use it in any way that will cause talk or rouse suspicion. I say  again: keep it safe, and keep it secret!'       'You are very mysterious! What are you afraid of?'       'I am not certain, so I  will say no  more. I may  be able to  tell you   something  when I come back. I am going off at once: so this is good-bye for  the present.' He got up.       'At  once!' cried Frodo.  'Why,  I thought  you were staying  on for at  least a week. I was looking forward to your help.'       'I did mean to  - but I have had to change my mind. I  may be away for a   good while;  but  I'll come and see you again, as soon  as I  can. Expect me  when you see me! I shall  slip in quietly.  I  shan't often be visiting  the  Shire openly again.  I find that I have become rather unpopular. They  say I  am a  nuisance  and  a  disturber  of the  peace. Some people  are  actually  accusing me of spiriting Bilbo away, or worse. If you want to know, there is  supposed to be a plot between you and me to get hold of his wealth.'       'Some  people!'  exclaimed Frodo.  'You  mean  Otho  and  Lobelia.  How  abominable!  I would give  them Bag  End and everything else, if I could get   Bilbo back  and go off tramping in the country with  him. I  love the Shire.  But I begin to  wish, somehow, that I had gone too. I wonder if I shall ever   see him again.'       'So do I,' said Gandalf. 'And  I wonder many other things. Good-bye now!   Take  care  of  yourself!  Look out  for  me, especially at  unlikely times!   Good-bye!'       Frodo saw him to the door. He gave a final wave of his hand, and walked  off at a surprising pace; but Frodo  thought the  old wizard looked unusually  bent, almost  as if  he was carrying a great weight. The evening was closing  in, and his cloaked figure quickly vanished into the twilight. Frodo did not  see him again for a long time.       ####-<h4>Chapter 2.</h4> <br> The Shadow of the Past            The talk did not die down in nine  or even ninety-nine days.
