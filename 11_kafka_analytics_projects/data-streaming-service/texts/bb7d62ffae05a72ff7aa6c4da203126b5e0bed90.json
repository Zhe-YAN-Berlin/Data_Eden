Beyond count of years       I stump round and round,       Never lie on the ground,       Not even to die.       Oliphaunt am I,       Biggest of all,       Huge, old, and tall.       If ever you'd met me       You wouldn't forget me.       If you never do,       You won't think I'm true;       But old O liphaunt am I,       And I never lie.       'That,'  said Sam, when he  had finished  reciting, `that's a rhyme  we  have in the Shire. Nonsense maybe, and maybe not. But we have our tales too,   ####-and news out of the South, you know.  In the old days hobbits used  to go on  their travels now and again. Not that many ever came back,  and not that all  they said  was believed: news from Bree,  and not sure  as Shiretalk , as the  sayings  go. But I've heard tales of the big folk down away in the Sunlands.   Swertings we call 'em in our tales;  and they ride on oliphaunts, 'tis said,  when they fight. They put houses and towers  on  the oliphauntses backs  and  all,  and  the oliphaunts throw rocks and trees at one another. So  when you   said  \"Men out of the  South, all  in red and gold;\" I said  \"were there any  oliphaunts? \" For if there was, I was going to  take a look, risk or no. But  now I don't suppose I'll ever see  an oliphaunt. Maybe there ain't no such a   beast.' He sighed.       `No, no oliphaunts,' said Gollum again.   'Smjagol has not heard of them.  He does not want to see them. He does not want  them to be. Smjagol wants to  go away from here and hide somewhere safer. Smjagol wants master to go.  Nice  master, won't he come with Smjagol? '       Frodo stood up. He had laughed in the midst  of  all his cares when Sam  trotted out the old fireside rhyme  of Oliphaunt, and the laugh had released  him from hesitation. `I  wish we had a thousand oliphaunts with Gandalf on a  white one at their head,' he  said.  `Then  we'd break  a way into this evil  land,  perhaps.  But  we've not; just our  own tired legs, that's all. Well,  Smjagol, the third turn may turn the best. I will come with you.'       'Good  master,  wise master,  nice master!'  cried  Gollum in  delight,  patting Frodo's knees. `Good master! Then rest  now, nice hobbits, under the  shadow of  the stones, close under the stones! Rest and lie quiet, till  the  Yellow Face goes away. Then we can go quickly. Soft  and quick as shadows  we  must be!'   ####-<h4>Chapter 4.</h4> <br> Of Herbs and Stewed Rabbit            For the few hours of daylight that were left they rested, shifting into  the shade as the sun moved, until  at last the shadow of the western  rim of  their  dell grew long, and darkness filled all  the hollow. Then they ate  a   little,  and drank  sparingly.  Gollum  ate nothing, but  he  accepted water   gladly.       `Soon get more now,' he said, licking  his lips. `Good water  runs down  in  streams to  the Great River,  nice water in the lands  we are  going to.  Smjagol will get food there too, perhaps. He's very hungry, yes, gollum! ' He  set his two large flat hands on his  shrunken belly, and a pale  green light  came into his eyes.       The  dusk was deep  when at length  they  set  out,  creeping over  the  westward rim of the  dell, and fading like ghosts into the broken country on  the borders of the road: The moon was now three nights from the full, but it   did not climb over the mountains until nearly midnight, and the  early night  was very dark. A single red light burned high up in the Tower s of the Teeth,   but  otherwise no sign could be seen or heard of the sleepless watch  on the  Morannon.       For  many  miles the red eye  seemed  to  stare at  them as they  fled,  stumbling through a barren  stony country.  They did not dare  to  take  the  road, but they  kept  it  on their left, following its line as  well as they  could at a little distance.  At last, when  night  was growing old and  they  were already weary, for they had taken only one short rest, the eye dwindled   to a small fiery point a nd then vanished: they had turned the dark  northern  shoulder of the lower mountains and were heading southwards.       With hearts  strangely  lightened they  now rested again, but  not  for   long. They were  not going  quick enough for Gollum. By his reckoning it was  nearly thirty leagues from the  Morannon to the cross-roads above Osgiliath,  and he hoped to cover that distance in four journeys. So soon they struggled  on once  more,  until the  dawn  began  to  spread  slowly in the wide  grey  solitude. They had then  walked almost eight leagues; and the hobbits  could  not have gone any further, even if they had dared.       The  growing  light revealed to them  a  land already, less  barren and  ruinous. The mountains still loomed up ominously on their  left, but near at  hand  they could  see the southward road,  now  bearing away  from the black   ####-roots of the  hills and  slanting  westwards.  Beyond it were slopes covered  with  sombre trees  like  dark clouds."
