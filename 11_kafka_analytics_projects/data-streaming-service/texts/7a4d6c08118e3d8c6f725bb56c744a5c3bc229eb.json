'It was a Black Rider on wings, a Nazgyl,' said Gandalf. 'It could have  taken you away to the Dark Tower . '       'But it was not  coming  for me, was  it?' faltered Pippin. 'I mean, it  didn't know that I had... '       'Of course not,' said  Gandalf. 'It is two hundred  leagues or  more in  straight  flight  from Barad-dyr to Orthanc, and even a Nazgyl  would take a   few hours to fly between  them.  But Saruman certainly looked  in  the Stone   since the orc-raid, and more of his secret thought, I do not doubt, has been  read than he  intended. A  messenger has  been sent  to  find out what he is  doing. And  after what has happened tonight another will come, I think,  and  swiftly. So Saruman will come to  the last pinch of the vice that he has put  his  hand in. He has  no captive to  send. He has no Stone to see  with, and  cannot answer the summons. Sauron will  only  believe that he  is withholding  the captive and refusing to use the Stone. It will not  help Saruman to tell  the truth to the messenger. For Isengard may be ruined, yet he is still safe  in Orthanc. So  whether  he  will  or  no,  he  will appear a rebel. Yet  he  rejected  us, so as  to  avoid  that very thing! What he will  do in such  a   plight,  I  cannot guess.  He has power still, I think, while in Orthanc, to  resist the Nine Riders. He may try to do so. He may try to trap  the Nazgyl,  or  at least to slay the thing on which it now rides the  air. In  that case  let Rohan look to its horses!    ####-     'But I cannot tell how it will fall out, well or ill for us. It may  be  that the counsels of the Enemy will  be confused,  or hindered by  his wrath  with Saruman. It  may be that he will learn that  I was there and stood upon  the stairs of Orthanc-with  hobbits at my tail. Or that  an heir  of Elendil  lives and stood beside  me. If Wormtongue was not deceived by the  armour of  Rohan, he would remember Aragorn and the title that he claimed. That is what  I fear. And so we fly  -- not  from  danger but  into  greater danger.  Every  stride of Shadowfax bears you nearer to the Land of Shadow, Peregrin Took.'       Pippin made no answer, but clutched his cloak, as if a sudden chill had  struck him. Grey land passed under them.       'See now!' said Gandalf. 'The Westfold dales  are  opening  before  us.   Here we come back to the eastward  road. The dark shadow yonder is the  mouth  of the  Deeping-coomb. That way lies Aglarond a nd the  Glittering Caves.  Do  not ask  me about them. Ask Gimli, if you meet again, and for the first time  you  may  get an answer  longer than you wish.  You  will not see the  caves  yourself, not on this journey. Soon they will be far behind.'       'I thought you were going to stop  at Helm's Deep!' said Pippin. 'Where  are you going then?'       'To Minas Tirith, before the seas of war surround it.'       'Oh! And how far is that?'       'Leagues  upon  leagues,'  answered  Gandalf.  'Thrice as  far  as  the  dwellings of King Thjoden, and they are more than a hundred  miles east from  here, as  the  messengers of  Mordor fly. Shadowfax must run  a longer road.   Which will prove the swifter?       'We  shall ride  now till  daybreak, and that is  some hours away.  Then  even Shadowfax must  rest, in some hollow of the  hills: at Edoras, I  hope.  Sleep, if  you can! You  may see the first  glimmer of dawn upon the  golden   roof of  the house of Eorl. And in two days thence you shall see the  purple  shadow  of Mount Mindolluin and the  walls of the tower of Denethor white in  the morning.       'Away  now,  Shadowfax!  Run,  greatheart,  run as  you have never  run  before! Now we are come to the lands  where you were foaled  and every stone  you know. Run now! Hope is in speed!'       Shadowfax tossed his head and cried aloud, as if a trumpet had summoned  him to battle. Then he sprang forward. Fire flew from his feet; night rushed  over him.   ####-     As he  fell  slowly into  sleep, Pippin had a  strange feeling:  he and  Gandalf  were  still as stone, seated  upon the  statue of a running  horse,  while the world rolled away beneath his feet with a great noise of wind.       ####- * BOOK IV *              Chapter 1. The Taming of Smjagol            'Well, master,  we're in  a fix and  no mistake,'  sa id Sam  Gamgee. He  stood despondently with hunched shoulders beside Frodo, and peered out  with  puckered eyes into the gloom.       It was the third evening since they had fled from  the Company,  as far  as they could  tell:  they had  almost lost count of  the  hours during which  they had climbed and laboured among the barren slopes and stones of the  Emyn  Muil,  sometimes retracing  their  steps  because  they could  find  no  way  forward,  sometimes discovering  that they  had wandered in a circle back to  where they  had been hours before."
