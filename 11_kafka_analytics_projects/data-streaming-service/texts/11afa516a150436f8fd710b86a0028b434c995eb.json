Then  we plunged into the deep water and all was  dark. Cold it was as the tide of  death: almost it froze my heart.'       'Deep  is the abyss  that is spanned by Durin's  Bridge, and  none  has  measured it,' said Gimli.       'Yet  it has  a  bottom, beyond  light  and  knowledge,'  said Gandalf.  'Thither I came at last, to the  uttermost foundations of stone. He was with   ####-me still.  His fire was  quenched, but now he was a thing of slime, stronger   than a strangling snake.       'We fought far under the living earth, where time is  not counted. Ever   he clutched  me,  and  ever I  hewed  him,  till at last he  fled into  dark  tunnels. They were not made by Durin's  folk, Gimli  son of   Gluin. Far, far  below the  deepest delving  of the Dwarves, the world is gnawed  by nameless  things.  Even Sauron  knows them not. They  are  older  than  he. Now I have  walked there, but I will bring no report to darken the light of day. In that  despair my enemy was my only hope, and I pursued him, clutching at his heel.  Thus he brought me back at last to the secret  ways of Khazad-dym: too  well  he knew them all. Ever up now we went, until we came to the Endless Stair.'       'Long has that  been lost,' said  Gimli. 'Many have  said  that it  was  never made save in legend, but others say that it was destroyed.'       'It  was made, and it had not been destroyed,'  said Gandalf. 'From the  lowest dungeon to the highest peak  it climbed. ascending in unbroken spiral  in many thousand steps, until it issued at last in  Durin's Tower  carved in  the living rock of Zirak-zigil, the pinnacle of the Silvertine.       'There upon Celebdil was a lonely window in the snow, and before it lay  a  narrow space, a dizzy eyrie above the mists of the world.  The  sun shone  fiercely there, but all below was wrapped in cloud.  Out he sprang, and even  as I came behind, he burst into new flame. There was none to see, or perhaps  in after ages songs would still be sung of the Battle of the Peak.' Suddenly  Gandalf laughed. 'But what would they say in song? Those that looked up from  afar thought that  the  mountain was crowned with storm. Thunder they heard,  and lightning, they said, smote upon  Celebdil,  and leaped back broken into  tongues of fire. Is not that enough? A great smoke rose about us, vapour and  steam. Ice fell like  rain. I threw down my enemy, and he fell from the high  place  and broke the  mountain-side  where  he  smote it  in his ruin.  Then  darkness took me; and I strayed out  of thought and time, and I wandered far   on roads that I will not tell.       'Naked I was sent back -- for a brief time, until my task  is done. And  naked I lay upon  the mountain-top. The tower behind was crumbled into dust,  the window gone; the ruined stair was choked with burned and broken stone. I  was alone, forgotten, without escape upon the hard horn  of the world. There  I lay staring upward, while the stars wheeled over, and each day was as long  as a life-age of the earth. Faint to my ears came the gathered rumour of all  lands: the springing and the dying,  the song  and the weeping, and the slow   ####-everlasting  groan  of  overburdened stone. And  so  at the last Gwaihir the  Windlord found me again, and he took me up and bore me away.       ' 'Ever am I fated to be your burden, friend at need,' I said.       ' 'A burden  you have been,'  he answered, 'but not so  now. Light as a   swan's feather in my claw you are. The Sun shines  through you. Indeed  I do  not think you need me any more: were  I to let you fall you would float upon   the wind.'       ' 'Do not let me fall!' I gasped, for I felt life in me again. 'Bear me  to Lothlurien!'       ' 'That indeed is the command of the Lady Galadriel who sent me to look   for you,' he answered.       'Thus  it was  that  I  came to Caras Galadhon and found you but lately  gone. I tarried  there  in  the  ageless time of that  land where days bring  healing  not  decay. Healing I found, and I was clothed  in white. Counsel I  gave and counsel took. Thence by strange roads I came, and messages I  bring  to some of you. To Aragorn I was bidden to say this:        Where now are the DÂ®nedain, Elessar, Elessar?       Why do thy kinsfolk wander afar?       Near is the hour when the Lost should come forth,       And the Grey Company ride from the North.       But dark is the path appointed for thee:       The Dead watch the road that leads to the Sea.       To Legolas she sent this word:       Legolas Greenleaf long under tree       In joy thou hast lived. Beware of the Sea!       If thou hearest the cry of the gull on the shore,       Thy heart shall then rest in the forest no more.'       Gandalf fell silent and shut his eyes.        'Then she sent me no message?' said Gimli and bent his head.       'Dark are her words,'  said Legolas, 'and little  do they mean to those  that receive them."
