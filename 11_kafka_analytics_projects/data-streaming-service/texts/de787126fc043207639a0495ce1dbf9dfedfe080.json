The  tree stood  mournfully above  them, its  dry  leaves now hanging  limp,  and   rattling in the chill  easterly wind. Aragorn moved  slowly away. He came to   the ashes of the watch-fire  near the river -bank, and then  began to retrace  the ground back towards the knoll where the battle had been fought. Suddenly  he stooped and bent low with his face almost in the grass. Then he called to  the others. They came running up.       'Here at  last we find  news!' said Aragorn. He lifted up a broken leaf  for them  to see,  a large  pale leaf of golden  hue, now fading and turning  brown. 'Here is a mallorn-leaf  of Lurien, and there are small crumbs on it,  and a  few more crumbs in the grass.  And  see! there are  some pieces of cut  cord lying nearby!'       'And here is  the knife that cut them!' said Gimli. He stooped and drew  out of a tussock, into which some heavy foot had trampled it, a short jagged   blade. The  haft from  which it  had  been snapped was beside it. 'It was an  orc-weapon,'  he said,  holding it gingerly, and looking with disgust at the  carved handle: it  had been shaped like  a hideous  head with squinting eyes  and leering mouth.       'Well, here is  the strangest riddle that we have yet found!' exclaimed  Legolas.  'A  bound  prisoner  escapes  both from  the  Orcs  and  from  the  surrounding horsemen.  He  then stops, while still in the open, and cuts his  bonds with an orc-knife. But how and why?  For if his legs were tied, how did  he walk? And if his arms were tied, how did he use the knife? And if neither   were tied, why did he cut the cords at all? Being pleased with his skill, he  then sat down and quietly ate some waybread! That at least is enough to show  that he was a hobbit, without the mallorn-leaf. After that,  I  suppose,  he  turned his arms into  wings and flew away singing into the trees. It  should  be easy to find him: we only need wings ourselves!'       'There was sorcery here right enough,' said  Gimli. 'What was that  old  man doing? What have you to say, Aragorn, to the reading of Legolas. Can you   better it?'       'Maybe,  I could,' said Aragorn, smiling.  'There are  some other signs  near at hand  that  you have not considered. I agree that the prisoner was a   hobbit and must have had either legs  or hands free, before he came  here. I  guess that it was  hands, because the riddle then becomes easier,  and  also  because, as I read the marks, he was carried to this point by  an Orc. Blood   ####-was spilled  there,  a few paces away, orc-blood. There  are  deep prints of  hoofs  all about this  spot, and signs that a heavy thing was  dragged away.  The Orc  was slain by horsemen, and later  his body  was hauled to the fire.  But the hobbit  was not seen: he was not \"in the open\", for it was night and  he still had his elven-cloak. He was exhausted and  hungry, and it is not to  be wondered at  that, when he had cut his bonds with the knife of his fallen  enemy, he rested and ate a little  before he crept away. But it is a comfort  to  know  that he had some lembas in  his  pocket, even though  he  ran away  without gear  or pack;  that, perhaps, is  like a hobbit. I say he, though I  hope and guess  that both  Merry and  Pippin were  here together. There  is,  however, nothing to show that for certain.'       'And how do you suppose that either of  our friends came to have a hand  free?' asked Gimli.       'I do  not know how it happened,' answered Aragorn. 'Nor  do I know why  an Orc was carrying them  away. Not  to help  them to escape, we may be sure.  Nay, rather I think that I now begin to understand a matter that has puzzled  me  from  the beginning: why when  Boromir had fallen  were the Orcs content  with the capture  of Merry and Pippin? They did not seek out  the rest of us,   nor attack our camp;  but instead they went with all speed towards Isengard.   Did they suppose they had captured the Ring-bearer and his faithful comrade?   I think not. Their masters would not dare to give such plain orders to Orcs,   even if they knew so much themselves; they would not speak openly to them of  the  Ring: they  are not trusty servants. But  I  think  the  Orcs had  been  commanded  to capture hobbits, alive, at all costs.  An attempt was made  to  slip out with the precious prisoners  before the  battle. Treachery perhaps,  likely  enough with such folk; some large and bold Orc may have  been trying  to  escape with the  prize  alone, for his own ends. There, that is my tale.  Others might  be devised. But on this we may count in any case: one at least   of our  friends escaped. It is our task to find him and help  him  before we  return to Rohan.  We  must not  be  daunted by Fangorn, since need drove him  into that dark place.'       'I  do  not  know  which daunts me more: Fangorn, or the thought of the  long road through Rohan on foot,' said Gimli.       'Then let us go to the forest,' said Aragorn."
