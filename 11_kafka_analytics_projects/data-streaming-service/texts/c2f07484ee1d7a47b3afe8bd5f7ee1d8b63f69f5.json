  "text": " But  if master   says I must go  or I will go, then he  must try some way. But he must not go  to the terrible city, O no, of course not. That is where Smjagol helps. nice  Smjagol. though no one tells him what it is  all about. Smjagol helps again.  He found it. He knows it.'       'What did you find? ' asked Frodo.       Gollum crouched down and his voice  sank to a whisper again. 'A  little  path leading up into the mountains: and then a stair, a narrow stair, O yes,   very long and narrow. And then more stairs. And then'  -- his voice sank even  lower  -- `a tunnel, a dark tunnel; and at last  a little cleft, and  a path  high  above  the  main pass. It was that way  that  Smjagol got  out  of the  darkness. But it was years ago. The path may  have vanished now; but perhaps  not, perhaps not.'       `I  don't  like the sound of it at  all,' said Sam. `Sounds too easy at  any rate in the telling. If that path is still there, it'll be guarded  too.  Wasn't it guarded, Gollum? ' As he said this, he caught or fancied he caught   a green gleam in Gollum's eye. Gollum muttered but did not reply.   ####-     'Is  it not guarded? ' asked Frodo sternly. `And did you escape out  of  the  darkness,  Smjagol? Were you  not rather  permitted  to  depart upon an  errand? That at  least is w hat Aragorn  thought,  who found you by the Dead  Marshes some years ago.'       'It's  a lie! ' hissed Gollum, and an evil light came into  his eyes at  the  naming of Aragorn. `He lied on me, yes he did. I did  escape, all by my  poor  self.  Indeed I was told to seek for the Precious; and I have searched  and searched, of course I have. But not for the  Black One. The Precious was  ours, it was mine I tell you. I did escape.'       Frodo felt a  strange certainty that in this matter Gollum was for once  not so far from the truth as might be suspected; that he had somehow found a  way out of Mordor, and at least believed that it was by his own cunning. For   one thing,  he noted  that Gollum used  I, and that  seemed usually to be  a   sign, on its rare appearances. that some remnants of old truth and sincerity  were  for  the moment on top. But even  if Gollum  could  be trusted on this  point, Frodo did not forget the wiles  of the  Enemy. The 'escape' may  have   been allowed  or arranged, and well known in the Dark Tower. And in any case  Gollum was plainly keeping a good deal back.       'I ask you again,' he said: `is not this secret way guarded? '       But the name of Aragorn had put Gollum into a sullen  mood. He had  all  the injured air of a liar suspected when for once  he has told the truth. or   part of it. He did not answer.       'Is it not guarded? ' Frodo repeated.       `Yes, yes,  perhaps.  No safe places  in  this  country,'  said  Gollum  sulkily.  'No safe  places. But  master must try it or  go home.  . No other   way.' They could not get him to say more. The name of the perilous place and  the high pass he could not tell, or would not.       Its  name was Cirith Ungol, a name of dreadful  rumour.  Aragorn  could   perhaps have told them that name  and its  significance: Gandalf  would have  warned  them. But they  were  alone, and Aragorn was  far away, and  Gandalf  stood amid the ruin of Isengard and strove with Saruman, delayed by treason.  Yet even  as he spoke his last words to Saruman, and the palantnr crashed in  fire upon the steps of Orthanc. his thought was ever upon Frodo and Samwise,  over the long leagues his mind sought for them in hope and pity.       Maybe Frodo  felt  it,  not knowing it, as he  had upon Amon  Hen, even  though he believed that Gandalf was  gone, gone  for ever into the shadow in  Moria far  away. He  sat upon the ground for a long while, silent, his  head   ####-bowed, striving  to recall  all that Gandalf had  said to him. But  for this  choice he could recall no counsel. Indeed Gandalf's guidance had  been taken  from them too  soon, too  soon, while the Dark Land was still very far away.  How they should enter it at the last  Gandalf had not said. Perhaps he could  not say. Into the stronghold of  the Enemy in the North, into Dol Guldur, he  had  once  ventured.  But  into  Mordor,  to  the Mountain  of  Fire and  to  Barad-dyr, since the Dark Lord  rose in power again, had  he ever   journeyed  there?  Frodo did not think  so. And here he was  a little halfling from the  Shire, a simple hobbit of the quiet countryside expected to find a way where  the  great ones could  not go, or dared not go. It was an evil  fate. But he  had  taken it   on himself in his  own sitting-room in the far-off spring  of  another  year,  so remote now that it was like a chapter  in a story  of the  world's  youth, when the Trees  of Silver and Gold were still in bloom. This  was  an evil choice. Which way should  he choose? And if both  led to terror   and death, what good lay in choice?        The day drew on. A deep silence fell upon the little  grey hollow where  they lay,  so  near to the borders of the land of fear: a silence that could  be felt, as if it  were a  thick veil that cut  them off from all the  world  about them."
