Lurking by a  stagnant mere,  peering in  the water as the dark  eve  fell, I  caught  him, Gollum. He was  covered  with green slime. He will never love me, I fear; for he bit me, and  I  was not gentle. Nothing more did I ever get from his mouth than the marks  of his teeth. I deemed it the worst part of  all  my journey, the road back,  watching him day and night, making him walk before  me with a halter  on his  neck, gagged, until he was tamed by lack of drink and food, driving him ever  towards Mirkwood. I brought him there at last and gave him to the Elves, for  we had agreed that this should  be  done; and I was  glad to  be  rid of his  company, for he  stank. For my part I hope never to look upon him again; but  Gandalf came and endured long speech with him.'       `Yes,  long  and weary,' said Gandalf, `but not without profit. For one  thing, the  tale  he told of his loss agreed  with  that which Bilbo has now  told openly  for  the  first time; but  that mattered little,  since  I  had  already guessed it. But I  learned then first that Gollum's ring came out of  the Great River nigh to the Gladden Fields. And I learned also  that he  had  possessed  it long. Many lives of his small kind. The power of the ring  had  lengthened his  years far beyond their span;  but that power only  the Great  Rings wield.       `And if that is  not proof enough, Galdor, there is the other test that  I spoke of. Upon this very ring  which you have here seen  held aloft, round   and unadorned, the  letters that Isildur reported may  still be read, if one  has the strength of will to set the golden thing in the fire a while. That I  have done, and this I have read:       Ash  nazg durbatulyk, ush  nazg  gimbatul,  ash  nazg  thrakatulyk  agh   burzum-ishi krimpatul.'       The change in  the wizard's voice  was  astounding. Suddenly it  became  menacing,  powerful, harsh as stone.  A  shadow seemed to pass over the high  sun,  and  the porch for  a moment grew  dark. All trembled,  and the  Elves  stopped their ears.       `Never before has any voice dared to utter the  words of that tongue in  Imladris,  Gandalf  the Grey,'  said  Elrond, as  the shadow passed  and the  company breathed once more.       `And let us  hope that none  will  ever speak it  here again,' answered  Gandalf. `Nonetheless I do not ask  your  pardon, Master Elrond. For if that  tongue is not soon to be heard in every corner of the West , then let all put  doubt aside  that  this thing is  indeed what the Wise  have  declared:  the   ####-treasure of the Enemy, fraught with all his malice;  and  in it lies a great  part of his strength  of old. Out of the Black Years come the words that the  Smiths of Eregion heard, and knew that they had been betrayed:       One Ring to  rule them all,  One  Ring to find  them, One Ring to bring  them all and in the Darkness bind them.       `Know  also, my  friends, that I learned more yet from Gollum.  He  was  loth to speak and his tale was unclear, but it  is beyond all doubt  that he  went to Mordor, and  there all  that  he knew was forced from him. Thus  the   Enemy knows now that the  One is found,  that it was  long in the Shire; and  since his servants have pursued it  almost to our  door, he  soon will know,  already he may know, even as I speak, that we have it here.'       All sat silent for a  while,  until  at length Boromir  spoke. `He is a   small thing, you say, this Gollum? Small, but great in mischief. What became  of him? To what doom did you put him?'       'He is in prison, but no worse,' said  Aragorn.  `He had suffered much.  There is no doubt that he  was tormented, and the fear of Sauron  lies black   on his heart. Still I for one am glad that he is safely kept by the watchful  Elves of Mirkwood. His malice is great and gives him a strength hardly to be  believed in one so lean and withered.  He could work much mischief still, if  he were free. And I do not doubt that he was allowed to leave Mordor on some  evil errand.'       `Alas!  alas!' cried Legolas,  and in  his  fair  elvish face there was  great distress. `The tidings that I was sent to bring must now be told. They  are not  good, but only  here have I learned  how evil they may seem to this  company. Smjagol, who is now called Gollum, has escaped.'       'Escaped?' cried Aragorn. 'That is ill news indeed. We shall all rue it  bitterly, I fear. How came the folk of Thranduil to fail in their trust?'       `Not through lack of  watchfulness,' said Legolas; `but perhaps through  over -kindliness. And we fear that the prisoner had aid from others, and that  more is known of our doings than we could wish. We guarded this creature day  and  night, at Gandalf's  bidding,  much  though we wearied of the task. But  Gandalf  bade us  hope still for his cure, and we had not the  heart to keep   him ever in dungeons under the earth, where he would fall  back into his old  black thoughts."
