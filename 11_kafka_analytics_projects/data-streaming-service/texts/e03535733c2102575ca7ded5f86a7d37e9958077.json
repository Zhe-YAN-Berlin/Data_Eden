And  I begin to  see it in my mind  all the time, like a  great  wheel of fire.'       Sam's  quick  spirits  sank again  at  once. He  looked  at  his master   anxiously, and he took his hand.  'Come, Mr.  Frodo!' he said. 'I've got one  thing  I  wanted: a bit of light. Enough  to help  us, and yet I guess  it's  dangerous too. Try a bit further,  and then we'll lie close and have a rest.  But take a morsel to eat now, a bit of the E lves' food; it may hearten you.'       Sharing  a  wafer of   lembas, and  munching it as  best they could with  their parched  mouths. Frodo and Sam  plodded on. The light,  though no more  than a grey  dusk, was now enough for them to see that they were deep in the  valley  between  the mountains. It sloped  up gently  northward,  and at its  bottom  went the bed  of a now dry  and  withered stream.  Beyond  its stony  course  they saw a beaten  path that  wound  its way under the  feet of  the  westward cliffs. Had they known,  they could have reached it quicker, for it  was a track that  left the main Morgul-road at the  western  bridge-end  and  went down  by  a long stair cut in the rock to the valley's  bottom.  It was  used  by  patrols  or  by  messengers going  swiftly  to  lesser  posts  and  strongholds north-away, between Cirith Ungol and the narrows of  Isenmouthe,  the iron jaws of Carach Angren.       It was  perilous for the hobbits to use  such  a path,  but they needed  speed, and  Frodo felt that he could not face the  toil of  scrambling among  the boulders or in the trackless glens  of  the Morgai. And  he  judged that  northward was, maybe, the way that their hunters would least expect them  to  take.  The  road east  to the plain, or the pass back westward,  those  they  would first search most thoroughly. Only when he was well north of the Tower   did he mean to turn and seek for some way to take him east, east on the last  desperate  stage of his journey. So now  they crossed the stony bed and took   to  the orc-path, and  for some time  they  marched along  it. The cliffs at  their left  were overhung, and they could  not be seen  from above; but  the  path made many bends, and at each  bend they  gripped their  sword-hilts and  went forward cautiously.   ####-     The  light grew no stronger,  for  Orodruin was still belching forth  a   great  fume that, beaten  upwards by  the  opposing airs, mounted higher and   higher,  until it  reached  a  region  above  the  wind  and  spread  in  an  immeasurable roof, whose central pillar rose out of the shadows beyond their  view. They had  trudged for more than an hour  when they heard a sound  that  brought them to a halt. Unbelievable, but unmistakable. Water trickling. Out  of a gully on the left, so sharp  and narrow  that it look ed as if the black   cliff had been cloven by some  huge  axe, water came dripping down: the last  remains, maybe, of some sweet rain gathered  from sunlit seas, but ill-fated  to  fall at last upon the walls of  the Black Land and wander fruitless down  into  the dust. Here it came out of  the rock in a little falling streamlet,  and  flowed  across the path, and turning south  ran away swiftly to be lost   among the dead stones.        Sam sprang towards it. 'If ever I see the Lady again, I will tell her!'  he cried . 'Light  and now  water!' Then he stopped. 'Let me  drink first Mr.  Frodo,' he said.       'All right, but there's room enough for two.'       'I didn't  mean  that,'  said  Sam.  'I  mean:  if it's  poisonous,  or   something  that will  show  its  badness quick, well,  better me  than  you,  master, if you understand me.'       'I do. But I think we'll trust our luck together, Sam; or our blessing.  Still, be careful now, if it's very cold!'       The water was cool but not icy, and it had an unpleasant taste, a t once  bitter and  oily, or  so they would have said at home. Here it seemed beyond  all  praise, and beyond fear  or  prudence. They  drank their  fill, and Sam  replenished his water -bottle. After that Frodo felt easier, and they went on  for several miles, until the broadening of the road and  the beginnings of a   rough wall along its edge warned them that they were drawing near to another   orc-hold.       'This  is  where  we  turn aside, Sam,' said  Frodo. 'And we  must turn  east.'  He  sighed as he looked a t  the gloomy ridges across the  valley. 'I   have just about  enough strength left to find  some hole  away up there. And   then I must rest a little.'       The river -bed  was now some way  below the path. They scrambled down to  it,  and began to cross  it. To their surprise they came upon dark pools fed  by  threads  of water trickling down from some source  higher up the valley.    ####-Upon its  outer marges under the westward mountains Mordor was a dying  land,  but it was not yet dead. And here things still grew, harsh, twisted, bitter,  struggling  for life."
