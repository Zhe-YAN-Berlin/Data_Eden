  "text": " Whether he  erred or no, of this I am sure: he died well, achieving some good thing. His  face was more beautiful even than in life.       `But, Frodo, I pressed you hard at first about Isildur's  Bane. Forgive  me! It was unwise in such an hour and place. I had not had time for thought.  We had had a hard fight, and there was more than enough to fill my mind. But  even as  I spoke  with you, I drew  nearer to the mark, and so  deliberately  shot wider.  For you must know that much is still preserved  of ancient lore  among the Rulers of the city  that is not spread abroad. We of  my house are  not  of the line  of  Elendil.  though the blood of NÂ®menor is in us. For we  reckon back our line  to  Mardil,  the good steward, who ruled in the king's  stead when he went away to war. And  that was King Edrnur, last  of the line  of Anbrion, and  childless, and  he  came never back. And the stewards  have  governed the city since that day, though it was many generations of Men ago.       'And this I remember of Boromir as a boy,  when we together learned the  tale of our sires and the history of our city, that always it displeased him  that his father was not king. \"How many hundreds of years needs it to make a  steward a king, if the king  returns not? \" he asked. \"Few years, maybe,  in   ####-other places of less  royalty,\" my father  answered. \"In Gondor ten thousand   years  would not  suffice.\"  Alas!  poor Boromir. Does  that  not  tell  you   something of him?  '       'It does,' said Frodo. `Yet always he treated Aragorn with honour.'       'I doubt it  not,' said  Faramir. `If he  were satisfied  of  Aragorn's  claim  as you say, he would greatly reverence him. But the pinch has not yet  come. They had not yet reached Minas Tirith or become rivals in her wars.        `But I  stray. We in  the house of Denethor  know much  ancient lore by  long  tradition,  and  there  are  moreover in  our  treasuries many  things  preserved: books and tablets writ on withered parchments, yea, and on stone,  and on leaves of silver and of gold, in divers characters. Some none can now  read; and for the rest,  few ever unlock them. I can  read a little in them,  for I have had teaching. It was these  records that brought the Grey Pilgrim  to  us. I first saw him when I was a child,  and he has been twice or thrice  since then.'       'The Grey Pilgrim? ' said Frodo. 'Had he a name?'       'Mithrandir we  called  him in  elf-fashion,' said Faramir,  'and he was  content. Many are my names in many countries,  he said. Mithrandir among the  Elves, Tharkyn to the  Dwarves; Olurin I was in my youth in the West that is   forgotten, in  the  South Incbnus, in  the North Gandalf;  to the East  I go  not.'       'Gandalf!' said Frodo. 'I thought it was he.  Gandalf  the Grey dearest  of counsellors. Leader of our Company. He was lost in Moria.'       'Mithrandir  was  lost!  '  said Faramir.  'An  evil fate seems to have  pursued your fellowship. It is hard indeed to believe that one  of so  great  wisdom, and of  power -- for many wonderful things he  did among us  -- could  perish, and so much lore be taken from the world. Are you sure of  this, and   that he did not just leave you and depart where he would? '       'Alas! yes,' said Frodo. `I saw him fall into the abyss.'       'I see that there  is some great tale of dread in  this.' said  Faramir  `which perhaps  you may  tell me in the evening-time. This Mithrandir was, I  now guess, more than a lore-master: a great mover of the deeds that are done  in our  time. Had he been  among us to  consult concerning the hard words of  our  dream, he could have  made them clear to  us without need of messenger.  Yet, maybe,  he would  not  have done  so,  and  the journey of Boromir  was  doomed.  Mithrandir never spoke to us  of what was to  be, nor did he reveal  his purposes. He got leave of Denethor, how I  do  not  know, to look at the   ####-secrets of our treasury, and I learned a little of him, when he would  teach  (and that was seldom). Ever he would search and would  question us above all  else  concerning  the  Great  Battle  that was fought  upon Dagorlad  in the  beginning of Gondor, when He whom we do not name was over thrown.  And  he was  eager for stories of Isildur, though of him we had less to tell; for nothing  certain was ever known among us of his end.'       Now Faramir's voice  sank  to  a whisper. 'But  this much  I learned or   guessed, and I have kept it ever secr et in my heart since: that Isildur took   somewhat from the hand of the Unnamed, ere he  went away  from Gondor,  never  to be  seen among  mortal  men  again. Here  I  thought  was  the answer  to  Mithrandir's questioning. But  it seemed then a  matter that concerned  only  the seekers after ancient learning. Nor when the riddling words of our dream  were  debated  among us,  did I think of Isildur's  Bane as being  this same  thing. For Isildur was ambushed and  slain by  orc-arrows, according  to the   only legend that we knew, and Mithrandir had never told me more."
