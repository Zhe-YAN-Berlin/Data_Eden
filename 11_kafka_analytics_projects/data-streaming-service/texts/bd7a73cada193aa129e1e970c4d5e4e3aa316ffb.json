At length the feast came to an end. Elrond and Arwen rose and went down  the hall, and the company followed them in due  order. The doors were thrown  open, and they went across a  wide passage and through other doors, and came  into a further hall.  In it were no tables, but a bright fire was burning in  a great hearth between the carven pillars upon either side.       Frodo found himself  walking with  Gandalf. `This  is the Hall of Fire'  said the wizard.  `Here you will hear many songs and  tales-if you  can keep  awake. But except on high days it usually stands empty and quiet, and people  come here who wish for peace,  and thought. There is always a fire here, all   the year round, but there is little other light.'       As Elrond entered and  went towards  the seat prepared for  him, elvish  minstrels began to  make sweet  music.  Slowly  the hall  filled,  and Frodo  looked  with delight upon  the many  fair faces that were gathered together;  the golden firelight played upon them and shimmered in  their hair. Suddenly  he noticed, not far from the further  end of  the fire, a small dark  figure  seated on a stool with his back propped against a pillar. Beside him on  the  ground was a drinking-cup  and some bread. Frodo wondered whether he was  ill  (if people were ever ill in Rivendell), and had been unable  to  come to the  feast. His head seemed sunk  in sleep on  his breast, and a fold of his dark  cloak was drawn over his face.       Elrond wen t forward and stood beside the  silent figure. 'Awake  little  master.  he  said, with a smile. Then, turning to Frodo, he beckoned to him.  'Now  at last  the hour has come that you have wished  for, Frodo,' he said.  `Here is a friend that you have long missed.'       The dark figure raised its head and uncovered its face.       `Bilbo!' cried Frodo with sudden recognition, and he sprang forward.       `Hullo, Frodo my  lad!' said Bilbo.  `So  you have got here at  last. I   ####-hoped you would manage it. Well,  well! So  all this  feasting  is  in  your  honour, I hear. I hope you enjoyed yourself?'       'Why weren't  you there?' cried Frodo.  `And why haven't I been allowed  to see you before?'       `Because you were asleep. I have seen a good deal of you. I have sat by  your  side with Sam each day. But as for  the feast` I don't go in  for such  things much now. And I had something else to do.'       `What were you doing?'       `Why, sitting and thinking.  I do  a lot of that  nowadays, and this is  the best place to do it in, as a rule. Wake up, indeed!' he said, cocking an  eye at Elrond.  There was a  bright  twinkle in it and no sign of sleepiness  that Frodo could see. `Wake up! I was not asleep. Master Elrond. If you want  to  know,  you  have  all come  out from your  feast too  soon, and  you have  disturbed me-in the middle of making up a song. I was stuck  over a line  or   two, and was thinking  about them; but  now I don't suppose I shall ever get   them right.  There will  be such a deal of singing  that  the  ideas wi ll be  driven clean out  of my head.  I  shall have to get my friend the D®nadan to  help me. Where is he?'       Elrond laughed. `He  shall  be found,' he  said. `Then you two shall go  into a corner  and finish your task, and we will hear it and judge it before  we end our merrymaking.' Messengers were sent to find Bilbo's friend, though  none knew where he was, or why he had not been present at the feast.       In the meanwhile Frodo and Bilbo sat side by side, and Sam came quickly  and placed himself near them. They talked together in soft voices, oblivious  of the mirth and music in the hall about them.  Bilbo had not much to say of  himself. When  he had left Hobbiton he had wandered off aimlessly, along the  Road or in the country on either side;  but  somehow  he had steered all the  time towards Rivendell. `I got here without  much adventure,' he  said, `and  after  a rest I went on with  the dwarves to Dale: my last journey. I shan't   travel again.  Old  Balin had gone away. Then I came  back  here, and here I   have been. I have done this and that. I have  written some more of my  book.  And, of course, I make  up a few songs. They sing them occasionally: just to  please  me,  I think; for, of  course,  they aren't really  good  enough for   Rivendell. And I listen and  I think. Time doesn't seem to pass here: it just   is. A remarkable place altogether.       `I  hear  all kinds of  news,  from  over the Mountains, and out of the  South,  but  hardly  anything  from the Shire.  I heard  about  the Ring, of   ####-course. Gandalf has been here often. Not  that he has told me a  great deal,  he has become closer than ever these last few years. The D®nadan has told me  more. Fancy that ring of mine causing such a disturbance! It  is a pity that  Gandalf did not find out more sooner."
