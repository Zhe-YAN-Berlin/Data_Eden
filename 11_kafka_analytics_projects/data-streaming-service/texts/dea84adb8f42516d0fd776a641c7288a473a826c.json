Yet that  would  have  to be  done  that very  night, before they all went to bed.       'It's delightful!' he said with an effort. 'I  hardly feel that I  have  moved at all.'       The  travellers hung  up their  cloaks,  and piled  their packs  on the  floor. Merry led them down the passage and threw open a door at the far end.  Firelight came out, and a puff of steam.       'A bath!' cried Pippin. 'O blessed Meriadoc!'       'Which order  shall we  go in?' said Frodo. 'Eldest  first, or quickest  first? You'll be last either way, Master Peregrin.'       'Trust me to arrange things  better than that!'  said Merry.  'We can't  begin life  at Crickhollow with a quarrel over baths. In that room there are  three tubs, and  a copper full of boiling water. There are also towels, mats  and soap. Get inside, and be quick!'       Merry and Fatty went into the kitchen on the other side of the passage,  and  busied  themselves  with  the  final  preparations  for  a late supper.  Snatches of competing songs came  from the bathroom mixed  with the sound  of  splashing and wallowing.  The voice of Pippin was  suddenly lifted up  above  the others in one of Bilbo's favourite bath-songs.       Sing hey! for the bath at close of day       that washes the weary mud away!       A loon is he that will not sing:       O! Water Hot is a noble thing!         O! Sweet is the sound of falling rain,       and the brook that leaps from hill to plain;       but better than rain or rippling streams       is Water Hot that smokes and steams.         O! Water cold we may pour at need       down a thirsty throat and be glad indeed;       but better is Beer, if drink we lack,   ####-     and Water Hot poured down the back.         O! Water is fair that leaps on high       in a fountain white beneath the sky;       but never did fountain sound so sweet       as splashing Hot Water with my feet!       There  was a terrific  splash, and  a  shout  of  Whoa! from  Frodo. It  appeared that a lot of Pippin's  bath had imitated a fountain and leaped  on  high.       Merry went  to the door: 'What about supper a nd beer in the throat?' he  called. Frodo came out drying his hair.       'There's so much  water  in the air that I'm coming into the kitchen to  finish,' he said.       'Lawks!' said Merry, looking  in. The  stone floor  was swimming.  'You   ought to mop all that up before you get anything to eat. Peregrin,' he said.  'Hurry up, or we shan't wait for you.'       They had supper in the kitchen on a table near the fire. 'I suppose you   three won't want mushrooms again?' said Fredegar without much hope.       'Yes we shall!' cried Pippin.       'They're mine!'  said Frodo. 'Given to me  by Mrs. Maggot, a queen among  farmers' wives. Take your greedy hands away, and I'll serve them.'       Hobbits have a passion  for mushrooms,  surpassing  even  the greediest   likings  of Big  People.  A  fact  which  partly explains young Frodo's long  expeditions  to  the renowned fields of the Marish,  and the  wrath  of  the  injured Maggot. On this occasion there was plenty for all, even according to  hobbit standards. There were also many other things to follow, and when they  had  finished even Fatty Bolger heaved  a sigh  of content. They pushed back  the table, and drew chairs round the fire.       'We'll clear up later,' said Merry. 'Now tell me all  about it! I guess  that you have been having adventures, which was not quite fair without me. I  want a full account; and most of all I want to know what was the matter with  old Maggot, and why he spoke to me like that. He sounded almost as if he was  scared, if that is possible.'       'We  have all been  scared,' said Pippin after a pause,  in which Frodo  stared at the fire and did not speak. 'You would have been,  too, if you had  been chased for two days by Black Riders.'       'And what are they?'   ####-     'Black figures  riding  on black horses,'  answered Pippin.  'If  Frodo  won't talk, I will tell you the whole tale from the beginning.' He then gave  a  full account of their journey from the time  when they left Hobbiton. Sam  gave various supporting nods and exclamations. Frodo remained silent.       'I should  think you were making it all up,'  said Merry, 'if I had not  seen  that black shape on  the landing-stage - and heard the queer  sound in  Maggot's voice. What do you make of it all, Frodo?'       'Cousin Frodo has been very close,' said Pippin. 'But the time has come  for  him to open  out. So far we have been given nothing  more to go on than  Farmer  Maggot's  guess  that  it  has  something  to  do  with  old Bilbo's  treasure.'       'That  was  only  a  guess,' said Frodo hastily. 'Maggot does  not know  anything.'       'Old Maggot is  a shrewd fellow,' said Merry. 'A lot goes on behind his  round face that does not come out in his talk."
