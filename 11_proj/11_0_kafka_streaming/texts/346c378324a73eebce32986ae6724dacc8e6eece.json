' His voice came up clearly from below,  but Frodo could not see  him;  his grey elven-cloak had melted into the twilight.       Frodo took rather  more time to follow him. He had the  rope  about his  waist and  it was fast above, and he had shortened it so that it  would pull  him up before  he  reached the ground; still he did not want to risk a fall,  and he had not quite  Sam's faith in  this   slender grey line.  He found two  places, all  the  same,  where he had to trust wholly to it: smooth surfaces  where there was no hold even  for  his strong hobbit  fingers and the ledges  were far apart. But at last he too was down.       `Well!' he cried.  `We've done it! We've escaped from the Emyn Muil! And  now what next, I  wonder? Maybe we shall soon  be sighing for good hard rock   under foot again.'       But   Sam  did   not  answer:  he  was   staring  back  up  the  cliff.   `Ninnyhammers!  ' he said. `Noodles! My beautiful rope! There it is tied to a   stump,  and  we're  at the  bottom.  Just  as  nice a little stair for  that  slinking Gollum as we could leave. Better put up a signpost to say which way  we've gone! I thought it seemed a bit too easy.'       `If you can think of any way  we could have both used the rope and  yet  brought  it down with  us, then you  can  pass on to me ninnyhammer, or  any   ####-other name your Gaffer gave you,' said Frodo. `Climb up and untie it and let   yourself down, if you want to! '       Sam scratched his head. `No,  I can't think how, begging  your pardon,'  he  said. `But I don't like leaving it, and that's  a fact.' He  stroked the  rope's  end  and  shook  it  gently.  `It goes  hard parting with anything I  brought  out  of  the  Elf-country. Made  by Galadriel herself, too,  maybe.  Galadriel,' he murmured  nodding his head  mournfully. He looked up and gave  one last pull to the rope as if in farewell.       To  the  complete surprise of both the hobbits it came loose. Sam  fell  over, and the long grey coils slithered silently down  on top  of him. Frodo  laughed. `Who  tied the rope? ' he said. `A good thing it held as long as it  did! To think that I trusted all my weight to your knot!'       Sam did not laugh. `I may not be much good at climbing, Mr.  Frodo,' he  said in injured tones, `but I do know something  about rope and about knots.   It's in the family, as you might  say. Why, my grand-dad, and my  uncle Andy  after him, him that  was the Gaffer's eldest brother he had a rope-walk over  by Tighfield many a year.  And I put as fast a hitch  over the  stump as any  one could have done, in the Shire or out of it.'       `Then the rope must have broken  -- frayed on the rock -edge, I expect,'  said Frodo.       `I bet it didn't! ' said Sam in an  even more injured voice. He stooped  and examined the ends. `Nor it hasn't neither. Not a strand!'       'Then I'm afraid it must have been the knot,' said Frodo.       Sam shook his  head and did not answer. He was passing the rope through  his  fingers  thoughtfully. `Have it  your own way, Mr.  Frodo,' he  said at  last, `but I think the  rope came off itself  -- when I called.' He coiled it  up and stowed it lovingly in his pack.       'It certainly came,' said Frodo, `and that's the  chief thing.  But now  we've got to think of our next move. Night will be on us soon. How beautiful  the stars are, and the Moon!'       'They do cheer  the heart, don't they?  ' said Sam looking up.  'Elvish  they  are. somehow. And the Moon's growing. We haven't  seen him for a night  or two in this cloudy weather. He's beginning to give quite a light.'       'Yes,' said Frodo; `but he  won't be full for some  days. I don't think   we'll try the marshes by the light of half a moon.'       Under the first shadows of night they started  out on the next stage of  their journey. After  a while Sam turned and looked back at the way they had   ####-come. The mouth  of the gully was a black notch in the  dim cliff. `I'm glad  we've got  the rope,' he said. 'We've set a little puzzle for  that footpad,  anyhow. He can try his nasty flappy feet on those ledges!'       They  picked  their  steps away from the  skirts of the cliff,  among a   wilderness of boulders  and  rough stones, wet  and slippery with the  heavy   rain.  The ground still fell  away  sharply. They had not gone very far when  they came upon a great fissure that yawned suddenly black before their feet.  It was not wide,  but it was too wide to  jump across in the dim light. They  thought they  could hear water  gurgling in  its  depths. It curved  away  on  their  left  northward, back  towards the hills. and so barred their road in  that direction, at any rate while darkness lasted.       'We had better try a way back southwards along the line of the cliff, I  think,'  said  Sam."
