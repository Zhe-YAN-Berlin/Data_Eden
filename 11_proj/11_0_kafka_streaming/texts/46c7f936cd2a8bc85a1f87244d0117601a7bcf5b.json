The Forest  of DrÂ®adan he  gives to  Ghvn-buri-ghvn and to his folk, to be their own  for ever; and hereafter let  no man enter it without their leave!'       Then the drums rolled loudly, and were silent.       At length after fifteen days of journey the wain of King Thjoden passed  through the green  fields of Rohan and  came to Edoras;  and  there they all  rested. The  Golden Hall  was arrayed  with fair hangings and it was  filled  with light, and there was  held the highest feast that it had known since the  days of its building. For after three days the Men  of the Mark prepared the  funeral  of Thjoden; and  he was laid in a  house of stone with his arms and  many  other  fair things that  he had possessed,  and over him was raised  a   great mound, covered with green turves of grass and  of white evermind.  And  now there were eight mounds on the east -side of the Barrowfield.       Then the Riders of the King's House  upon white horses rode round about  the barrow and sang together a song of Thjoden Thengel's  son that  Gljowine  his minstrel made,  and he made no  other song after. The slow voices of the  Riders stirred the hearts even of those who did not  know the speech of that  people; but the words of the song brought a light to the eyes of the folk of  the Mark as they heard again afar the thunder of the hooves of the North and   the voice of Eorl crying  above the battle upon the  Field of Celebrant; and  the  tale  of  the kings rolled on, and the  horn  of Helm  was  loud in the   ####-mountains, until the Darkness  came and King Thjoden arose  and rode through  the Shadow  to  the fire,  and died in splendour, even as the Sun, returning  beyond hope, gleamed upon Mindolluin in the morning.       Out of doubt, out of dark, to the day's rising       he rode singing in the sun, sword unsheathing.       Hope he rekindled, and in hope ended;       over death, over dread, over doom lifted       out of loss, out of life, unto long glory.       But Merry stood at the foot of the green mound,  and he wept, and  when  the song was ended he arose and cried:       'Thjoden King, Thjoden King!  Farewell! As a father you were to me. for   a little while. Farewell!'       When the burial  was  over and the  weeping of  women was stilled,  and   Thjoden was  left  at  last alone in his barrow, then folk gathered  to  the  Golden Hall for the great feast and  put away sorrow;  for Thjoden had lived  to full years  and ended in  honour no  less than the greatest of his sires.   And when the time  came that in the  custom of the Mark they should drink to  the memory of the kings, Jowyn  Lady of Rohan came  forth, golden as the sun  and white as snow, and she bore a filled cup to Jomer.       Then a minstrel and loremaster stood up and  named all the names of the   Lords of the Mark in their  order: Eorl the Young;  and Brego builder of the   Hall; and Aldor brother of Baldor the hapless;  and Frja, and  Frjawine, and  Goldwine, and Djor, and Gram; and Helm who lay  hid in Helm's Deep when   the  Mark was overrun; and so ended the nine mounds of the west-side, for in that  time the  line  was  broken,  and after came  the  mounds of the  east-side:  Frjalaf,  Helm s sister -son, and  Ljofa, and Walda, and Folca, and Folcwine,   and Fengel, and Thengel, and Thjoden the latest. And when Thjoden  was  named  Jomer drained the  cup. Then Jowyn bade those  that served to fill the cups,  and all  there assembled rose  and  drank to the  new  king, crying:  'Hail,  Jomer, King of the Mark!'       At the  last when the  feast drew to an end Jomer arose and  said: 'Now  this is the funeral feast of Thjoden the King; but I will speak ere we go of  tidings of joy,  for  he would not grudge that I should do so, since he  was  ever a father of Jowyn my sister. Hear then all my guests, fair folk of many  realms, such  as  have never before  been gathered  in  this  hall! Faramir,   ####-Steward  of  Gondor, and Prince of  Ithilien, asks that  Jowyn Lady of Rohan  should be his wife,  and she grants it full willing. Therefore they shall be  trothplighted before you  all.'       And Faramir and Jowyn stood  forth and set hand in  hand; and all there  drank to them  and were glad. 'Thus,'  said Jomer, 'is the friendship of the  Mark and of Gondor bound with a new bond, and the more do I rejoice.'       'No niggard are you, Jomer,' said Aragorn, 'to give  thus to Gondor the  fairest thing in your realm!'       Then Jowyn looked in the eyes of Aragorn, and  she said: 'Wish  me joy,   my liege-lord and healer!'       And he answered: 'I have wished  thee joy  ever since first I saw thee.  It heals my heart to see thee now in bliss.'       When the feast was over, those who were to go took leave of King Jomer.  Aragorn and his knights, and  the people  of Lurien  and of Rivendell,  made  ready  to  ride;  but Faramir  and Imrahil  remained  at  Edoras; and  Arwen  Evenstar remained also, and she said farewell  to her brethren."
