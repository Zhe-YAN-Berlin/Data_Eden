Forcing himself on  against a gust of fear and horror that shook him almost to his knees. Pippin  turned a  corner opening on the wide place behind  the City Gate. He stopped  dead. He had found Gandalf; but he shrank back, cowering into a shadow.        Ever since the middle  night the  great assault had gone  on. The drums  rolled. To the  north and to the  south company upon company  of  the  enemy  pressed to the walls. There came great beasts, like moving houses in the red   and fitful light, the mymakil  of  the Harad dragging through the lanes  amid  the fires huge towers and engines. Yet their Captain cared not  greatly what  they  did or how many might be slain:  their purpose was  only to  test  the  strength of the defence and to  keep the men  of Gondor busy in many places.   It was against the Gate that he would throw his heaviest weight. Very strong  it might be, wrought of steel and iron, and guarded with towers and bastions  of indomitable stone, yet it was the key, the weakest point in all that high  and impenetrable wall.       The drums  rolled louder. Fires leaped up. Great engines crawled across  the field; and in the midst was a huge ram, great as a forest -tree a hundred  feet in length,  swinging on mighty chains. Long had  it been forging in the  dark smithies  of Mordor, and  its hideous head, founded of black steel, was  shaped in  the likeness of a ravening wolf; on it spells of  ruin lay. Grond  they named it,  in memory of  the Hammer of the  Underworld  of  old.  Great  beasts drew it,  Orcs surrounded  it, and  behind  walked mountain-trolls to  wield it.       But about the Gate resistance still was stout, and there the knights of  Dol Amroth and the hardiest of the garrison stood at bay. Shot and dart fell  thick; siege-towers crashed or blazed  suddenly like torches. All before the  walls on either side of the Gate the  ground was choked  with wreck and with  bodies of the slain; yet still driven as by a madness more and more came up.        Grond crawled on. Upon  its housing no fire would catch; and though now  and again some great beast that  hauled it would go  mad and spread stamping  ruin among  the  orcs  innumerable  that guarded  it, their bodies were cast   aside from its path and others took their place.       Grond crawled on. The drums  rolled wildly. Over the  hills of slain  a   hideous shape appeared: a horseman, tall,  hooded, cloaked in black. Slowly,  trampling the fallen,  he rode forth, heeding no  longer any dart. He halted  and held up  a long pale sword. And as he did so a great  fear  fell on all,  defender  and foe alike; and the hands of men drooped to their sides, and no    ####-bow sang. For a moment all was still.       The drums rolled and rattled. With a vast rush Grond was hurled forward  by  huge hands. It reached the Gate. It  swung. A  deep boom rumbled through  the City like thunder running in the clouds. But the doors of iron and posts  of steel withstood the stroke.       Then  the  Black Captain rose  in  his  stirrups and  cried  aloud in a   dreadful voice, speaking in some forgotten tongue words of power and  terror  to rend both heart and stone.       Thrice he cried.  Thrice  the great ram boomed.  And suddenly  upon the  last  stroke the Gate of Gondor broke. As if stricken by some blasting spell  it burst asunder:  there  was  a flash of searing  lightning, and the  doors  tumbled in riven fragments to the ground.       In rode the Lord  of the Nazgyl. A great black  shape against the fires  beyond he loomed up, grown  to a vast menace of despair. In rode the Lord of  the Nazgyl, under  the  archway that no  enemy ever yet had  passed, and all   fled before his face.       All save one. There waiting,  silent and still in the  space before the  Gate, sat Gandalf upon Shadowfax: Shadowfax who alone  among the free  horses  of  the earth endured the terror, unmoving,  steadfast as  a graven image in  Rath Dnnen.       'You  cannot enter here,' said Gandalf, and the huge shadow halted. 'Go  back to the abyss prepared  for you! Go back! Fall into the nothingness that  awaits you and your Master. Go!'       The Black Rider flung back his hood, and behold! he had a kingly crown;   and yet upon no head visible was it set. The red fires  shone between it and  the mantled shoulders vast and dark. From a mouth unseen there came a deadly  laughter.       'Old fool!' he  said. 'Old fool! This is my hour. Do you not know Death  when you see it? Die  now and curse in vain!' And  with that he lifted  high  his sword and flames ran down the blade.       Gandalf did  not move.  And in that  very moment,  away  behind in some  courtyard  of the City, a cock crowed. Shrill and clear  he crowed,  recking  nothing of wizardry or war, welcoming  only  the morning that in the sky far   above the shadows of death was coming with the dawn."
