  "text": "'       Looking in  the Messenger's  eyes they read his thought.  He was to  be   that lieutenant, and gather all that remained of the West under his sway; he  would be their tyrant and they his slaves.        But Gandalf said:  'This is much  to demand for  the  delivery  of  one  servant: that your Master should receive in exchange what he must else fight   many a war to gain! Or has the field of Gondor destroyed his hope in war, so  that  he falls to haggling? And  if indeed we rated this  prisoner  so high,  what  surety have we that Sauron the Base Master of Treachery, will keep his  part? Where  is this prisoner?  Let him be brought forth and yielded to  us,   and then we will consider these demands.'       It  seemed then to Gandalf,  intent, watching  him as a  man engaged in  fencing with a deadly foe, that for the taking of a breath the Messenger was  at a loss; yet swiftly he laughed again.       'Do  not bandy words in  your  insolence with  the Mouth of Sauron!' he  cried. 'Surety you crave! Sauron gives none. If you sue for his clemency you   must first do his bidding. These are his terms. Take them or leave them!'       'These  we will take!' said Gandalf suddenly. He cast  aside  his cloak  and a white  light shone forth like a sword in that black  place. Before his  upraised hand   the  foul Messenger recoiled, and  Gandalf  coming seized and  took from him  the tokens: coat,  cloak, and sword. 'These we  will take  in  memory of our friend,' he cried.  'But  as for your  terms, we  reject  them  utterly. Get you gone, for your embassy is over and death is near to you. We  did not  come here  to waste words in treating  with Sauron,  faithless  and  accursed; still less with one of his slaves. Begone!'       Then the Messenger of Mordor laughed no more. His face was twisted with  amazement and anger to the  likeness of some wild beast that, as it crouches  on  its  prey, is smitten on the muzzle with a stinging rod. Rage filled him  and his mouth  slavered, and shapeless  sounds of fury came  strangling from  his throat. But he looked at the fell faces of the Captains and their deadly  eyes, and fear overcame his wrath. He  gave a great cry, and  turned, leaped   ####-upon his  steed, and with his company galloped madly back to  Cirith Gorgor.  But  as they went his soldiers blew their horns in signal long arranged; and  even before they came to the gate Sauron sprang his trap.       Drums rolled and fires leaped up.  The  great doors  of the  Black Gate  swung  back wide. Out  of  it streamed a great host  as  swiftly as swirling  waters when a sluice is lifted.       The Captains mounted  again  and rode back, and from the host of Mordor  there went up a jeering yell. Dust  rose smothering the air,  as from nearby  there marched up an army of Easterlings  that  had  waited for the signal in  the shadows of Ered Lithui beyond the further Tower.  Down from the hills on  either side of  the  Morannon poured Orcs innumerable. The men of  the  West   were  trapped, and soon. all about  the grey mounds where they stood, forces  ten times and more than ten times  their  match  would ring them in a sea of  enemies. Sauron had taken the proffered bait in jaws of steel.       Little  time was left to Aragorn for the ordering  of  his battle. Upon  the one hill he  stood with Gandalf, and there fair and desperate was raised  the  ba nner of  the  Tree and  Stars.  Upon the other hill hard by stood the  banners of Rohan and Dol Amroth, White Horse and Silver Swan. And about  each  hill a ring was made facing all ways, bristling with spear and sword. But in  the front  towards Mordor  where the  first bitter  assault would come there  stood the sons of Elrond on  the left with the DÂ®nedain  about them,  and on  the right  the  Prince Imrahil with the men of Dol Amroth tall and fair, and  picked men of the Tower of Guard.       The  wind blew, and the trumpets sang, and  arrows whined; but the  sun  now  climbing  towards  the South was  veiled  in the reeks  of Mordor,  and  through a threatening haze it  gleamed, remote, a  sullen red, as if it were  the ending of the day, or the  end maybe of all the world of  light. And out  of the gathering  mirk the Nazgyl came with. their  cold voices crying words  of death; and then all hope was quenched.       Pippin had bowed crushed with horror when  he  heard Gandalf reject the   terms and  doom Frodo  to the torment  of  the  Tower;  but  he had mastered   himself, and now he  stood beside Beregond in the front  rank of Gondor with  Imrahil's men. For  it seemed best to him to die  soon and  leave the bitter   story of his life, since all was in ruin.       'I wish Merry  was here,' he  heard himself saying, and quick  thoughts  raced  through his mind, even as he watched  the enemy  come charging to the   ####-assault. 'Well, well, now at  any rate  I understand  poor Denethor a little  better. We might die together, Merry and  I, and since die we must, why not?  Well, as he is not  here, I hope he'll find an easier end."
