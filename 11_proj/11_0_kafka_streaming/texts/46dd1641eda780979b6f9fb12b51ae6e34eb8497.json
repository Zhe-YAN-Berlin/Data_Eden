  "text": "  Mrs. Maggot brought out  beer in  a huge jug, and filled four large mugs. It  was a good brew,  and Pippin found himself more than compensated for  missing  the  Golden  Perch.  Sam  sipped his  beer  suspiciously.  He had a  natural  mistrust of the inhabitants of other parts of the Shire; and also he was not  disposed to be quick  friends with anyone who had beaten his master, however   long ago.       After  a few remarks about  the weather and the agricultural  prospects  (which were no worse than usual), Farmer Maggot put down his  mug and  looked  at them all in turn.       'Now, Mr.  Peregrin,' he  said,  'where  might you  be coming from, and  where might you be going  to?  Were you coming to visit' me? For, if so, you  had gone past my gate without my seeing you.'       'Well, no, '  answered Pippin.  'To tell  you the truth, since  you have  guessed  it, we got into the lane from the other end: we had come  over your   fields. But that was quite by accident.  We  lost our way in the woods, back   near Woodhall, trying to take a short cu t to the Ferry.'       'If you were  in a hurry,  the road would have served you better,' said  the farmer. 'But I wasn't worrying about  that. You have  leave to walk over   my land, if you have a  mind, Mr.  Peregrin. And you, Mr. Baggins  - though I  daresay  you  still like mushrooms.'  He laughed.  'Ah yes, I recognized the  name.  I recollect  the time when young Frodo  Baggins  was one of the worst   young rascals of Buckland. But it  wasn't mushrooms I was thinking of. I had  just heard the name Baggins before  you  turned up.  What do you think  that  funny customer asked me?'       They  waited anxiously for  him to go on. 'Well,' the farmer continued,  approaching his point with slow relish, 'he came riding on a big black horse  in at  the  gate, which  happened  to be open, and right up to my door.  All   ####-black he was  himself, too, and cloaked and hooded up, as if he did not want  to be known. \"Now what  in the Shire  can  he want?\" I thought to myself. We  don't see many of the Big Folk over the border; and anywa y I had never heard  of any like this black fellow.       ' \"Good-day to you!\" I says,  going  out to him. \"This  lane don't lead  anywhere,  and wherever  you may be going, your quickest way will be back to  the road.\" I didn't like the looks of  him; and when  Grip came out, he took   one sniff and  let out a  yelp as if he had been slung: he put down his tail  and bolted off howling. The black fellow sat quite still.       ' \"I come  from yonder,\" he  said,  slow  and stiff-like, pointing back   west, over my  fields, if you please.  \"Have you seen Baggins?\" he asked in a   queer voice,  and bent  down towards  me. I could not see any face,  for his  hood fell down so low; and I felt a sort of shiver down  my back. But  I did  not see why he should come riding over my land so bold.       ' \"Be off!\" I said. \"There are no Bagginses  here.  You're in the wrong  part of the Shire. You had better go back west to Hobbiton  - but you can  go  by road this time.\"       ' \"Baggins has  left,\"  he answered in a whisper. \"He is coming. He  is  not far away. I wish to find him. If he passes will you tell me? I will come  back with gold.\"       ' \"No you won't,\" I said.  \"You'll  go back  where you  belong,  double  quick. I give you one minute before I call all my dogs.\"       'He gave a sort  of hiss. It might have been laughing, and it might not.  Then he spurred  his great  horse right  at me, and I jumped  out of the way  only just in time. I called the dogs, but he swung off, and rode through the  gate  and up the lane  towards the causeway like a bolt  of thunder. What do   you think of that?'       Frodo sat for a moment looking at  the fire,  but  his only thought was  how on earth would they  reach the Ferry. 'I don't  know what  to think,' he  said at last.       'Then I'll tell you what to think,' said Maggot. 'You should never have  gone  mixing yourself up with Hobbiton folk, Mr. Frodo.  Folk  are queer  up  there.'  Sam  stirred in  his  chair,  and  looked  at  the  farmer  with an  unfriendly  eye. 'But you were always a  reckless lad. When  I heard you had  left the Brandybucks  and  gone  off  to that old Mr. Bilbo, I said that you   were going to find trouble. Mark my words, this  all comes of those  strange  doings of Mr. Bilbo's. His money was got in some strange fashion  in foreign   ####-parts, they  say. Maybe there is some that want  to know what has  become of  the gold and jewels that he buried in the hill of Hobbiton, as I hear?'       Frodo said  nothing:  the  shrewd  guesses of  the farmer  were  rather   disconcerting.       'Well, Mr. Frodo,' Maggot went  on, 'I'm glad that you've had the sense  to come back to Buckland. My  advice is: stay  there! And don't get mixed up  with these outlandish folk.  You'll have  friends  in these parts. If any of  these black  fellows come after you  again,  I'll  deal with  them."
