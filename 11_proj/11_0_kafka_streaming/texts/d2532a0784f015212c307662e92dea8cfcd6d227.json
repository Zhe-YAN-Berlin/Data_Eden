Jon gasped, then watched with awe as Tyrion Lannister spun around in a tight ball, landed lightly on his hands, then vaulted backward onto his legs.  Ghost backed away from him uncertainly.  The dwarf dusted himself off and laughed.  I believe I’ve frightened your wolf. My apologies.    He’s not scared,  Jon said. He knelt and called out.  Ghost, come here. Come on. That’s it.   The wolf pup padded closer and nuzzled at Jon’s face, but he kept a wary eye on Tyrion Lannister, and when the dwarf reached out to pet him, he drew back and bared his fangs in a silent snarl.  Shy, isn’t he?  Lannister observed.   Sit, Ghost,  Jon commanded.  That’s it. Keep still.  He looked up at the dwarf.  You can touch him now. He won’t move until I tell him to. I’ve been training him.    I see,  Lannister said. He ruffled the snow-white fur between Ghost’s ears and said,  Nice wolf.    If I wasn’t here, he’d tear out your throat,  Jon said. It wasn’t actually true yet, but it would be.   In that case, you had best stay close,  the dwarf said. He cocked his oversized head to one side and looked Jon over with his mismatched eyes.  I am Tyrion Lannister.    I know,  Jon said. He rose. Standing, he was taller than the dwarf. It made him feel strange.   You’re Ned Stark’s bastard, aren’t you?   Jon felt a coldness pass right through him. He pressed his lips together and said nothing.   Did I offend you?  Lannister said.  Sorry. Dwarfs don’t have to be tactful. Generations of capering fools in motley have won me the right to dress badly and say any damn thing that comes into my head.  He grinned.  You are the bastard, though.    Lord Eddard Stark is my father,  Jon admitted stiffly.  Lannister studied his face.  Yes,  he said.  I can see it. You have more of the north in you than your brothers.    Half brothers,  Jon corrected. He was pleased by the dwarf’s comment, but he tried not to let it show.   Let me give you some counsel, bastard,  Lannister said.  Never forget what you are, for surely the world will not. Make it your strength. Then it can never be your weakness. Armor yourself in it, and it will never be used to hurt you.   Jon was in no mood for anyone’s counsel.  What do you know about being a bastard?    All dwarfs are bastards in their father’s eyes.    You are your mother’s trueborn son of Lannister.    Am I?  the dwarf replied, sardonic.  Do tell my lord father. My mother died birthing me, and he’s never been sure.    I don’t even know who my mother was,  Jon said.   Some woman, no doubt. Most of them are.  He favored Jon with a rueful grin.  Remember this, boy. All dwarfs may be bastards, yet not all bastards need be dwarfs.  And with that he turned and sauntered back into the feast, whistling a tune. When he opened the door, the light from within threw his shadow clear across the yard, and for just a moment Tyrion Lannister stood tall as a king.      CATELYN  Of all the rooms in Winterfell’s Great Keep, Catelyn’s bedchambers were the hottest. She seldom had to light a fire. The castle had been built over natural hot springs, and the scalding waters rushed through its walls and chambers like blood through a man’s body, driving the chill from the stone halls, filling the glass gardens with a moist warmth, keeping the earth from freezing. Open pools smoked day and night in a dozen small courtyards. That was a little thing, in summer; in winter, it was the difference between life and death.  Catelyn’s bath was always hot and steaming, and her walls warm to the touch. The warmth reminded her of Riverrun, of days in the sun with Lysa and Edmure, but Ned could never abide the heat. The Starks were made for the cold, he would tell her, and she would laugh and tell him in that case they had certainly built their castle in the wrong place.  So when they had finished, Ned rolled off and climbed from her bed, as he had a thousand times before. He crossed the room, pulled back the heavy tapestries, and threw open the high narrow windows one by one, letting the night air into the chamber.  The wind swirled around him as he stood facing the dark, naked and empty-handed. Catelyn pulled the furs to her chin and watched him. He looked somehow smaller and more vulnerable, like the youth she had wed in the sept at Riverrun, fifteen long years gone. Her loins still ached from the urgency of his lovemaking. It was a good ache. She could feel his seed within her. She prayed that it might quicken there. It had been three years since Rickon. She was not too old. She could give him another son.   I will refuse him,  Ned said as he turned back to her. His eyes were haunted, his voice thick with doubt.  Catelyn sat up in the bed.  You cannot. You must not.    My duties are here in the north. I have no wish to be Robert’s Hand.    He will not understand that. He is a king now, and kings are not like other men."
