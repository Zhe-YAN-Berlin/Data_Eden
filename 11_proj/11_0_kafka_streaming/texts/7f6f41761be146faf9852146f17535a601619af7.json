Four Riders did indeed follow me,  but they turned back  after a  wh ile and made  for the Ford,  it seems. That  helped a  little,  for there  were only five, not  nine,  when your camp was  attacked.       'I  reached here at last  by  a long  hard  road,  up the Hoarwell  and  through the  Ettenmoors, and down from the north . It took me nearly fourteen  days  from  Weathertop,  for  I  could  not  ride  among  the rocks  of  the   ####-troll-fells, and  Shadowfax departed.  I sent  him back to his master; but a   great friendship has grown between us, and if I have need he will come at my  call.  But so it  was  that I  came to Rivendell  only three days before the  Ring, and news of  its peril had already been brought here-which proved well  indeed.       `And  that, Frodo, is  the end of my account. May Elrond and the others  forgive  the length of  it.  But such a thing has not happened  before, that  Gandalf broke tryst and did not come  when  he  promised. An account to  the  Ring-bearer of so strange an event was required, I think.       'Well, the  Tale is now  told, from first to last. Here we all are, and  here is the Ring. But we have not yet come any  nearer to our  purpose. What  shall we do with it?'       There was silence. At last Elrond spoke again.       `This  is grievous news concerning Saruman,' he  said; `for  we trusted  him and he  is deep in  all our counsels. It is perilous to study too deeply  the arts of the Enemy, for  good  or  for ill. But such falls and betrayals,   alas, have happened before. Of  the tales that  we have heard  this  day the  tale  of  Frodo was most strange  to me. I have known few hobbits, save Bilbo  here; and it seems to me that he is  perhaps  not so alone and singular as I  had thought him. The world has changed much since I last was on the  westward  roads.       `The  Barrow-wights we know by  many names; and of the Old Forest   many  tales have been told: all that now remains is but an outlier of its northern  march. Time was when a squirrel could go from tree to tree from what  is now  the  Shire to Dunland west of Isengard. In those lands I journeyed once, and  many things wild and strange I knew. But I had forgotten Bombadil, if indeed  this is still the same that walked the woods and  hills long  ago, and  even  then was older than the old. That was not then his name. Iarwain Ben -adar we  called  him,  oldest and  fatherless. But many another name he has since been   given by other folk:  Forn by the Dwarves,  Orald by Northern Men, and other   names beside. He is a strange creature, but maybe I should have summoned  him  to our Council.'       `He would not have come,' said Gandalf.       `Could  we not still send messages to him  and obtain his help?'  asked   ####-Erestor. `It seems that he has a power even over the Ring.'       `No, I should not put  it so,'  said Gandalf. `Say rather that the Ring  has no power over him. He is  his own master.  But he  cannot alter  the Ring  itself,  nor break its  power over  others.  And now he is withdrawn  into a   little  land,  within  bounds that  he  has set, though none  can  see them,  waiting perhaps for a change of days, and he will not  step beyond them.'       `But within those bounds nothing seems to  dismay him,'  said  Erestor.  `Would he not take the Ring and keep it there, for ever harmless?'       `No,' said Gandalf, `not willingly. He might  do so,  if all  the  free  folk of the world begged  him, but he would not understand the need. And  if  he were given  the Ring,  he would soon  forget  it, or most likely throw it  away. Such  things  have  no hold on his mind. He  would  be  a  most unsafe  guardian; and that alone is answer enough. '       `But in any case,' said Glorfindel, `to send the Ring to him would only  postpone the day of evil. He  is far away. We could not now take  it back to  him, unguessed, unmarked by any spy.  And even if we could, soon or late the  Lord of  the Rings wou ld learn of  its hiding place and  would bend  all his  power towards it. Could that power be defied by Bombadil alone? I think not.  I think that in the end, if all  else is conquered, Bombadil will fall, Last  as he was First; and then Night will come.'       `I know little of Iarwain save the name,' said Galdor; `but Glorfindel,  I think, is right. Power to defy our Enemy is not in him, unless  such power   is  in the earth itself. And yet we see that Sauron  can torture and destroy  the very hills. What power still remains lies with us,  here in Imladris, or   with Cirdan at the Havens, or in Lurien. But have they the strength, have we  here the strength to withstand the Enemy, the  coming of Sauron at the last,  when all else is overthrown?'       `I have not the strength,' said Elrond; `neither have they.'       `Then if the  Ring cannot be  kept  from him for ever by strength' said  Glorfindel, `two things only remain  for  us to attempt: to send it over the  Sea, or to destroy it."
