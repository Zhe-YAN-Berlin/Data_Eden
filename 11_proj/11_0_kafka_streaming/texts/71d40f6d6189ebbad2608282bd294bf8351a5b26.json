  "text": " I bad a  great-great-great-granduncle once, Bullroarer Took, and â€”\"  \"Yes, yes, but  that was  long ago,\" said Gloin. \"I was  talking about you. And I  assure  you  there  is  a  mark  on  this  door-the  usual  one  in  the  trade,  or used  to be.  Burglar  wants  a  good  job,  plenty  of  Excitement  and  reasonable  Reward,  that's  how  it  is  usually  read.  You  can  say  Expert  Treasure-hunter  instead of Burglar  if  you like. Some of them do. It's all the same to us. Gandalf told us that there was a  man of  the  sort  in  these parts  looking  for  a  Job  at once,  and  that he had arranged  for a meeting here this Wednesday tea-time.\"  \"Of course there is a mark,\" said Gandalf. \"I put it there myself. For very good  reasons. You asked me to find the fourteenth man for your expedition, and I chose  Mr. Baggins.  Just  let  any one say I chose the wrong man or the wrong house, and  you can stop at  thirteen and have all  the bad  luck you  like, or go back  to digging  coal.\"  He  scowled  so  angrily  at Gloin  that  the  dwarf  huddled  back  in  his  chair;  and  when  Bilbo  tried  to  open  his  mouth  to  ask  a  question,  he  turned  and  frowned  at  him and stuck oat his bushy eyebrows, till Bilbo shut his mouth tight with a snap.   ####-\"That's  right,\"  said  Gandalf.  \"Let's  have  no  more  argument.  I  have  chosen  Mr.  Baggins  and  that  ought  to  !6te  enough  for  all  of  you.  If  I  say  he  is  a  Burglar,  a  Burglar he is, or will be when the time comes. There is a lot more in him than you  guess,  and  a  deal  more  than  he  has  any  idea  of  himself.  You  may  (possibly)  all  live to thank me yet. Now Bilbo, my boy, fetch the lamp, and let's have little light  on this!\"  On  the  table  in  the  light  of  a  big  lamp  with  a  red  shad  he  spread  a  piece  of  parchment rather like a map.  \"This was made  by  Thror,  your  grandfather,  Thorin,  he  said  in  answer  to  the  dwarves' excited questions. \"It is a plan of the Mountain.\"  \"I  don't  see  that  this  will  help  us  much,\"  said  Thorin  disappointedly  after  a  glance. \"I remember the Mountain well enough and the lands about it. And I know  where Mirkwood is, and the Withered Heath where the great dragons bred.\"  \"There  is  a dragon marked  in  red on  the Mountain,  said Balin,  \"but  it will be  easy enough to find him without that, if ever we arrive there.\"  \"There  is one point  that you haven't noticed,\"  said  the wizard,  \"and  that  is  the  secret  entrance.  You  see  that  rune  on  the  West  side,  and  the  hand  pointing  to  it  from the other runes?** That marks a hidden passage to the Lower Halls.  \"It may  have  been  secret  once,\"  said  Thorin,  \"but  how  do  we  know  that  it  is  secret  any  longer?  Old  Smaug  had  lived  there  long  enough  now  to  find  out  anything there is to know about those caves.\"  \"He may-but he can't have used it for years and years. \"Why?\"  \"Because  it  is  too  small.  'Five  feet  high  the  door  and  three may walk  abreast'  say  the  runes,  but  Smaug  could  not  creep  into  a  hole  that  size,  not even when he  was  a  young  dragon,  certainly  not  after  devouring  so  many  of  the  dwarves  and  men of Dale.\"  \"It  seems  a  great  big  hole  to me,\"  squeaked Bilbo  (who  had  no  experience  of  dragons  and  only  of  hobbit-holes) He was getting excited and  interested  again, so  that he forgot to keep his mouth shut. He loved maps, and in his hall there hung a  large  one  of  the  Country  Round with  all  his  favourite walks marked  on  it  in  red  ink.  \"How  could  such  a  large  door  be  kept  secret  from  everybody  outside,  apart  from the dragon?\" he asked. He was only a little hobbit you must remember.   \"In lots of ways,\" said Gandalf. \"But in what way this one has been hidden we  don't  know  without  going  to  see.  From  what  it  says  on  the  map  I  should  guess  there  is  a  closed  door  which  has  been  made  to  look  exactly  like  the  side  of  the                                                                 ** Look at the maps with this book, and you will see the runes there.      ####-Mountain. That is the usual dwarves' method- I think that is right, isn't it?\" \"Quite  right,\" said Thorin.  \"Also,\" went on Gandalf, \"I forgot  to mention  that with  the map went a key, a  small and curious key. Here it is!\" he said, and handed to Thorin a key with a long  barrel and intricate wards, made of silver. \"Keep it safe!\"  \"Indeed  I  will,\"  said  Thorin,  and  he  fastened  it  upon  a  fine  chain  that  hung  about his neck and under his jacket. \"Now things begin to look more hopeful. This  news alters them much for-the better. So far we have had no clear idea what to do.  We  thought  of  going  East,  as  quiet  and  careful  as  we  could,  as  far  as  the  Long  Lake. After that the trouble would begin.\"  \"A long time before that, if I know anything about the loads East,\" interrupted  Gandalf."
