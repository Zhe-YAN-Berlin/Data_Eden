As soon as she had  squeezed her  soft  squelching  body and its folded  limbs out of the upper exit from her lair, she moved with a  horrible speed,  now running on her creaking legs, now making a sudden bound. She was  between  Sam  and his master. Either she did  not see Sam, or she avoided him for the  moment as  the bearer of the  light` and fixed all her intent upon one prey,  upon Frodo,  bereft of  his Phial, running heedless up the path, unaware yet  of his  peril. Swiftly he ran, but Shelob was  swifter;  in a few  leaps she  would have him.       Sam gasped and gathered  all his  remaining breath  to shout. 'Look out  behind!  ' he yelled.  'Look  out  master!  I'm'  -- but suddenly his cry was  stifled.       A long clammy hand went over his mouth and  another caught  him  by the  neck, while something wrapped itself about his leg.  Taken off  his guard he  toppled backwards into the arms of his attacker.       `Got him! ' hissed Gollum in his ear. `At  last, my precious, we've got  him, yes, the nassty hobbit. We takes this one. She'll get the other. O yes,  Shelob will get him,  not Smjagol: he promised; he won't hurt Master at all.  But he's got you, you nassty filthy little sneak!' He spat on Sam's neck.       Fury at the treachery, and desperation at the delay when his master was  in  deadly  peril, gave  to Sam  a sudden violence and strength that was far   ####-beyond anything that Gollum had expected from this slow stupid hobbit, as he  thought him.  Not Gollum  himself  could have twisted  more quickly  or more  fiercely. His hold on Sam's mouth slipped, and Sam ducked and lunged  forward  again, trying to tear away from the grip on his neck. His sword was still in  his hand, and on his   left arm,  hanging by  its thong, was Faramir's staff.   Desperately  he tried to turn and stab his enemy. But Gollum  was too quick.  His long right arm shot out, and he  grabbed  Sam's wrist:  his fingers were  like a vice; slowly and relentlessly he bent the hand down and forward, till  with a cry of pain Sam released the sword and it fell to the ground; and all  the while Gollum's other hand was tightening on Sam's throat.       Then Sam played his last trick. With all his  strength  he  pulled away  and got his feet firmly planted; then suddenly he drove his legs against the  ground and with his whole force hurled himself backwards.       Not  expecting  even this simple trick from Sam, Gollum fell  over with  Sam on top, and he received the weight of the sturdy hobbit in  his stomach.   A sharp hiss came out  of him, and  for a second his hand upon  Sam's throat  loosened;  but his  fingers still gripped the sword-hand. Sam  tore  himself  forward  and  away,  and stood up, and then  quickly he wheeled away  to his  right,  pivoted on the  wrist held by Gollum.  Laying hold of the staff with  his  left hand,  Sam swung it up, and down it came with a whistling crack on  Gollum's outstretched arm, just below the elbow.        With a squeal Gollum let go. Then  Sam  waded in; not waiting to change   the staff from left to right he dealt another savage blow. Quick as  a snake  Gollum slithered  aside. and the stroke aimed at his head  fell  across  his  back. The staff  cracked and broke.  That was  enough for him. Grabbing from  behind  was an old game of his,  and  seldom  had he failed in it.  But this  time,  misled by spite,  he  had made the  mistake  of speaking and gloating  before he had  both hands on his  victim's  neck. Everything  had gone wrong  with  his beautiful plan,  since that horrible  light  had  so  unexpectedly  appeared in the darkness. And now he was face to face with a furious  enemy,  little less than his own size. This fight was not for him. Sam  swept up his  sword from the ground and raised it. Gollum squealed , and springing aside on  to all fours, he  jumped away in one big bound like a frog. Before Sam could  reach him, he was off, running with amazing speed back towards the tunnel.        Sword in  hand  Sam  went  after him.  For the  moment he had forgotten   everything else but the red fury in his brain and the desire to kill Gollum.   ####-But before he could overtake him, Gollum  was gone. Then  as the  dark  hole  stood before him and the stench came out to meet him, like a clap of thunder   the thought of Frodo  and the monster  smote upon Sam's mind. He spun round,  and rushed wildly up the path, calling and calling his master's name. He was  too late. So far Gollum's plot had succeeded.     ####-   Chapter 10. The Choices of Master Samwise            Frodo was lying face upward  on the ground and the monster  was bending  over  him, so intent  upon her victim  that she took  no heed of Sam and his  cries, until  he was close at  hand. As he rushed up he  saw that Frodo  was  already  bound  in  cords, wound about him from ankle to  shoulder,  and the   monster with her great forelegs was beginning half to lift, half to drag his  body away."
