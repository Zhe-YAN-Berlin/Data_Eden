Old Will Whitfoot had been in the Lockholes longer than any, and though  he had  perhaps  been treated  less harshly  than  some,  he needed a lot of  feeding up before he could look the part of Mayor; so Frodo agreed to act as  his Deputy, until Mr. Whitfoot was  in shape again. The  only  thing that he  did as  Deputy Mayor was  to reduce the Shirriffs to  their proper functions  and numbers. The task of  hunting  out the last remnant of  the ruffians was  left to Merry and  Pippin,  and  it was soon done. The southern gangs, after   hearing the news of the Battle of  Bywater, fled out of the land and offered  little resistance to the Thain. Before the Year's End the few survivors were  rounded  up in  the  woods,  and those  that  surrendered were shown  to the   ####-borders.        Meanwhile the  labour  of  repair went on apace, and   Sam was kept very  busy. Hobbits can work like bees when the mood  and the need comes on   them.  Now  there were thousands of willing  hands of all ages, from the  small but  nimble ones of the hobbit lads and lasses to the well-worn and horny ones of  the gaffers  and gammers.  Before Yule not a brick was left standing of  the  new Shirriff-houses  or of anything that had been built by 'Sharkey's  Men';   but the bricks were used to repair many an old hole, to make it snugger  and   drier. Great stores of goods a nd  food, and beer,  were found that had  been  hidden away  by  the  ruffians in  sheds and barns and deserted  holes,  and  especially in the tunnels  at Michel  Delving  and  in the  old quarries  at  Scary; so that there was a great deal better cheer that Yule than anyone had  hoped for.       One of the first  things done in Hobbiton,  before even  the removal of  the new mill, was the clearing of the Hill and Bag End, and the  restoration  of Bagshot Row. The front of the new sand-pit was all levelled and made into  a large sheltered garden, and new holes were dug in the southward face, back  into the Hill, and they  were lined with brick. The Gaffer  was  restored to  Number Three; and he said often and did not care who heard it:       'It's an  ill wind as  blows nobody no good, as I always say. And All's  well as ends Better!'       There was some discussion of the name that the new row should be given.  Battle  Gardens  was thought  of,  or Better  Smials.  But  after a while in  sensible hobbit-fashion it was just called New Row. It was a purely  Bywater   joke to refer to it as Sharkey's End.       The trees were the worst loss and damage, for at Sharkey's bidding they  had been  cut down recklessly far  and wide over the Shire; and Sam  grieved  over this more than anything else. For  one thing, this hurt would take long  to heal, and only  his great-grandchildren, he thought,  would see the Shire  as it ought to be.       Then  suddenly  one day, for he had  been too busy for  weeks to give a   thought to  his adventures,   he remembered the gift of Galadriel. He brought   the box  out and showed it to  the  other Travellers (for  so they were  now  called by everyone), and asked their advice.       'I wondered when you would think of it,' said Frodo. 'Open it!'       Inside it was filled with a grey  dust, soft and fine, in the middle of   ####-which was a seed, like a small nut with a  silver shale. 'What can I do with  this?' said Sam.       'Throw it in the air on  a breezy day  and  let it do  its  work!' said  Pippin.       'On what?' said Sam.       'Choose one spot  as  a  nursery, and  see what happens  to the  plants  there,' said Merry.       'But I'm  sure  the Lady  would not like me to keep it all  for my  own  garden, now so many folk have suffered,' said Sam.       'Use all the wi ts and knowledge you have of your own, Sam,' said Frodo,   'and then  use the  gift to  help  your  work  and  better  it. And  use  it  sparingly. There is not much here, and I expect every grain has a value.'       So Sam planted saplings in all the  places where specially beautiful or   beloved trees had been destroyed, and he put a grain of the precious dust in  the soil at the root of each. He went up and  down the Shire in this labour;  but if he  paid special attention to Hobbiton and Bywater no one blamed h im.  And  at  the end he found that he still had a little of the dust left; so he  went to the Three-Farthing  Stone, which is as near the centre of the  Shire  as no matter, and cast it  in  the air with his  blessing. The little silver   nut he  planted  in the Party Field where the tree had  once  been;  and  he  wondered  what would  come  of  it. All through  the winter  he remained  as  patient  as  he  could,  and tried  to  restrain himself  from  going  round  constantly to see if anything was happening.       Spring surpassed his wildest hopes. His trees began to sprout and grow,  as if time was in a hurry and  wished to make one year do for twenty. In the  Party Field a beautiful young sapling leaped up: it had silver bark and long  leaves and burst into golden flowers  in April."
