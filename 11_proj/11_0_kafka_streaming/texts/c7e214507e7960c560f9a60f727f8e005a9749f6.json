Who can know the mind of a wolf?  Ser Rodrik Cassel said when Bran asked him why they howled. Bran’s lady mother had named him castellan of Winterfell in her absence, and his duties left him little time for idle questions.   It’s freedom they’re calling for,  declared Farlen, who was kennelmaster and had no more love for the direwolves than his hounds did.  They don’t like being walled up, and who’s to blame them? Wild things belong in the wild, not in a castle.    They want to hunt,  agreed Gage the cook as he tossed cubes of suet in a great kettle of stew.  A wolf smells better’n any man. Like as not, they’ve caught the scent o’ prey.   Maester Luwin did not think so.  Wolves often howl at the moon. These are howling at the comet. See how bright it is, Bran? Perchance they think it is the moon.   When Bran repeated that to Osha, she laughed aloud.  Your wolves have more wit than your maester,  the wildling woman said.  They know truths the grey man has forgotten.  The way she said it made him shiver, and when he asked what the comet meant, she answered,  Blood and fire, boy, and nothing sweet.   Bran asked Septon Chayle about the comet while they were sorting through some scrolls snatched from the library fire.  It is the sword that slays the season,  he replied, and soon after the white raven came from Oldtown bringing word of autumn, so doubtless he was right.  Though Old Nan did not think so, and she’d lived longer than any of them.  Dragons,  she said, lifting her head and sniffing. She was near blind and could not see the comet, yet she claimed she could smell it.  It be dragons, boy,  she insisted. Bran got no princes from Nan, no more than he ever had.  Hodor said only,  Hodor.  That was all he ever said.  And still the direwolves howled. The guards on the walls muttered curses, hounds in the kennels barked furiously, horses kicked at their stalls, the Walders shivered by their fire, and even Maester Luwin complained of sleepless nights. Only Bran did not mind. Ser Rodrik had confined the wolves to the godswood after Shaggydog bit Little Walder, but the stones of Winterfell played queer tricks with sound, and sometimes it sounded as if they were in the yard right below Bran’s window. Other times he would have sworn they were up on the curtain walls, loping round like sentries. He wished that he could see them.  He could see the comet hanging above the Guards Hall and the Bell Tower, and farther back the First Keep, squat and round, its gargoyles black shapes against the bruised purple dusk. Once Bran had known every stone of those buildings, inside and out; he had climbed them all, scampering up walls as easily as other boys ran down stairs. Their rooftops had been his secret places, and the crows atop the broken tower his special friends.  And then he had fallen.  Bran did not remember falling, yet they said he had, so he supposed it must be true. He had almost died. When he saw the weatherworn gargoyles atop the First Keep where it had happened, he got a queer tight feeling in his belly. And now he could not climb, nor walk nor run nor swordfight, and the dreams he’d dreamed of knighthood had soured in his head.  Summer had howled the day Bran had fallen, and for long after as he lay broken in his bed; Robb had told him so before he went away to war. Summer had mourned for him, and Shaggydog and Grey Wind had joined in his grief. And the night the bloody raven had brought word of their father’s death, the wolves had known that too. Bran had been in the maester’s turret with Rickon talking of the children of the forest when Summer and Shaggydog had drowned out Luwin with their howls.  Who are they mourning now? Had some enemy slain the King in the North, who used to be his brother Robb? Had his bastard brother Jon Snow fallen from the Wall? Had his mother died, or one of his sisters? Or was this something else, as maester and septon and Old Nan seemed to think?  If I were truly a direwolf, I would understand the song, he thought wistfully. In his wolf dreams, he could race up the sides of mountains, jagged icy mountains taller than any tower, and stand at the summit beneath the full moon with all the world below him, the way it used to be.   Oooo,  Bran cried tentatively. He cupped his hands around his mouth and lifted his head to the comet.  Ooooooooooooooooooo, ahooooooooooooooo,  he howled. it sounded stupid, high and hollow and quavering, a little boy’s howl, not a wolf’s. Yet Summer gave answer, his deep voice drowning out Bran’s thin one, and Shaggydog made it a chorus. Bran haroooed again. They howled together, last of their pack.  The noise brought a guard to his door, Hayhead with the wen on his nose. He peered in, saw Bran howling out the window, and said,  What’s this, my prince?   It made Bran feel queer when they called him prince, though he was Robb’s heir, and Robb was King in the North now."
