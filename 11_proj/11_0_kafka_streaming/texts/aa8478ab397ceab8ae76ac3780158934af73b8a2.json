But from her the lineage of the Elf-lords of  old descended among  Men.  There live  still those of whom  L®thien  was the  foremother,  and  it  is  said  that  her line shall  never fail.  Elrond of  Rivendell is of that Kin. For of  Beren and L®thien  was born Dior Thingol's  heir;  and of him Elwing  the White whom Edrendil wedded, he that sailed his  ship out of the mists of the world into the seas of heaven with the Silmaril  upon  his brow.  And  of  Edrendil  came  the  Kings  of  N®menor,  that  is  Westernesse.'       As Strider was speaking  they watched his strange eager face, dimly lit   ####-in the red glow of the wood-fire. His eyes shone, and his voice was rich and  deep. Above him was a black starry  sky. Suddenly a pale light appeared over   the crown  of Weathertop behind  him. The  waxing  moon  was climbing  slowly  above  the  hill that  overshadowed  them, and the  stars above the hill-top  faded.       The  story ended. The hobbits moved and stretched. 'Look!' said  Merry.  'The Moon is rising: it must be getting late.'       The others looked up. Even as they did so, they saw on the  top of  the  hill something small and dark  against  the  glimmer of the moonrise. It was  perhaps only a large stone or jutting rock shown up by the pale light.       Sam  and Merry  got up and walked away from the fire. Frodo  and Pippin  remained seated in silence.  Strider was watching the moonlight on  the hill  intently.  All seemed quiet and still, but Frodo felt  a cold dread creeping  over his heart,  now that Strider was  no longer speaking. He huddled closer   to the fire. At that moment Sam came running back from the edge of the dell.       'I don't  know what it is,'  he  said, 'but  I suddenly felt afraid.  I  durstn't  go  outside this dell  for any money;  I felt that  something  was  creeping up the slope.'       'Did you see anything?' asked Frodo, springing to his feet.       'No, sir. I saw nothing, but I didn't stop to look.'       'I  saw something,' said Merry; 'or  I thought  I did  -  away westwards  where  the moonlight was  falling  on  the  flats  beyond the  shadow of the  hill-tops, I thought there were two or three black shapes. They seemed to be  moving this way.'       'Keep close to the  fire, with your faces outward!' cried Strider. 'Get  some of the longer sticks ready in your hands!'       For a breathless  time  they sat there, silent  and  alert, with  their  backs  turned to the  wood-fire, each gazing into the shadows that encircled  them. Nothing happened. There was no sound or  movement in the night.   Frodo  stirred,  feeling that he must break the silence:  he longed  to  shout  out  aloud.       'Hush!' whispered Strider.  'What's  that?' gasped Pippin at  the  same  moment.       Over the  lip of the little dell, on the side away  from the hill, they  felt, rather  than saw, a shadow  rise,  one  shadow or  more than one. They   ####-strained their eyes, and the shadows  seemed to grow. Soon there could be no  doubt:       three or four  tall black  figures  were standing  there  on the slope,  looking down  on  them. So black were they that they seemed like black holes  in the deep shade behind them. Frodo  thought that he heard  a faint hiss as  of venomous breath  and felt a thin  piercing chill. Then the  shapes slowly  advanced.       Terror overcame Pippin and Merry, and they threw themselves flat on the  ground. Sam shrank to Frodo's side. Frodo was hardly less terrified than his  companions; he  was quaking  as  if he was bitter cold,  but his  terror was  swallowed  up in  a sudden temptation  to put on the Ring. The  desire to do   this laid hold of him, and he could think of nothing else. He did not forget  the Barrow,  nor  the  message  of  Gandalf;  but  something  seemed  to  be  compelling  him to disregard  all warnings, and he longed to yield. Not with   the hope of escape, or of doing anything, either good or bad: he simply felt  that he must take the Ring and put  it on his finger. He could not speak. He  felt Sam looking at him, as if  he knew  that  his  master was in some great  trouble, but  he could not turn  towards him. He shut his eyes and struggled  for a while; but  resistance became unbearable, and at  last he  slowly drew  out the chain, and slipped the Ring on the forefinger of his left hand.       Immediately, though everything  else remained as before,  dim and dark,  the shapes became  terribly clear. He was able to  see beneath  their  black   wrappings. There were  five  tall  figures: two standing on the lip  of  the  dell, three advancing. In their white faces burned  keen and merciless eyes;   under their mantles were long grey robes;  upon  their grey hairs were helms  of silver; in their haggard hands  were  swords of steel. Their eyes fell on  him and pierced him, as they rushed towards him."
