  "text": "        That view was somehow disquieting; so they  turned  from  the sight and   went down into  the hollow circle. In  the  midst of it there stood a single  stone, standing  tall  under  the  sun above,  and at this hour  casting  no  shadow. It was shapeless and yet significant: like a landmark, or a guarding  finger, or more like  a  warning. But they were now hungry, and the sun  was  still at the fearless noon; so they set their backs against the east side of  the stone. It was cool,  as if the sun had  had no power to warm  it; but at  that time this seemed pleasant. There they took food and drink,  and made as  good a noon-meal under the open sky as anyone could wish; for  the food came  from 'down under Hill'. Tom had provided them with plenty for the comfort of  the day. Their ponies unburdened strayed upon the grass.        Riding over  the hills,  and eating  their fill, the warm  sun and  the   ####-scent  of  turf,  lying a little  too long, stretching  out  their legs  and  looking at the sky above their noses: these things are,  perhaps,  enough to  explain  what  happened.  However,  that  may  be:  they  woke  suddenly and  uncomfortably from a sleep they had never meant  to take. The standing stone  was cold, and it cast a long pale shadow that stretched eastward  over them.  The sun, a pale and watery yellow, was gleaming  through the mist just above  the  west wall  of the  hollow  in which  they lay; north, south, and  east,  beyond the wall the fog was thick, cold and white. The air was silent, heavy  and  chill. Their ponies  were standing  crowded together  with their  heads  down.       The hobbits sprang to their feet in alarm,  and ran to the western rim.  They found that they were upon an island in the fog. Even as they looked out  in  dismay  towards the setting sun, it sank before their  eyes into a white  sea, and a cold grey shadow sprang up in the East behind. The fog  rolled up  to the walls and rose above them, and as it mounted it bent over their heads  until  it  became a roof: they were shut  in a  hall of  mist  whose central  pillar was the standing stone.       They felt as if a trap was closing about them; but  they did  not quite  lose heart. They still remembered  the hopeful view they had had of the line   of the Road ahead,  and they still knew in  which direction it  lay. In  any  case, they now had so great a dislike for that hollow place  about the stone  that no  thought  of remaining there  was in their minds.  They packed up as  quickly as their chilled fingers would work.       Soon  they were leading their ponies  in single file  over the  rim and  down the long northward slope of  the hill,  down into a foggy sea. As  they  went down the mist  became colder  and damper, and their hair hung lank  and  dripping  on  their foreheads. When they reached the bottom it  was so  cold   that  they halted  and got out cloaks and  hoods, which soon became  bedewed  with  grey drops. Then, mounting  their ponies,  they went  sl owly on again,   feeling their way by the rise and fall of the ground. They were steering, as  well as they could guess, for the gate-like opening at the far northward end  of  the  long valley which  they  had  seen in the  morning.  Once they were  through the  gap, they had only lo keep on in  anything like a straight line  and they were bound in the end to strike the Road. Their thoughts did not go  beyond that, except for a vague hope  that  perhaps  away  beyond the  Downs  there might be no fog.       Their going  was  very slow.  To  prevent their  getting separated  and   ####-wandering in different directions they went in file, with Frodo leading. Sam  was behind him, and after him came Pippin, and then Merry. The valley  seemed  to stretch on endlessly. Suddenly Frodo saw a hopeful sign.  On  either side  ahead a darkness began  to loom  through  the mist; and he guessed that they  were  at  last  approaching  the gap in  the hills,  the north-gate  of  the  Barrow-downs. If they could pass that, they would be free.       'Come on! Follow me!' he called back over  his shoulder, and he hurried  forward.  But  his  hope soon  changed  to bewilderment and alarm. The  dark  patches  grew darker, but they shrank; and suddenly he saw, towering ominous  before him and leaning  slightly towards one another like the pillars  of  a   headless door, two huge  standing  stones. He could not remember having seen  any sign  of  these in the  valley, when  he looked out from the hill in the  morning. He had passed  between them almost before he was aware: and even  as  he did so  darkness seemed to  fall round him. His pony  reared and snorted,   and he  fell off. When he looked back he found that he was alone: the others  had not followed him. 'Sam!' he  called.  'Pippin!  Merry! Come  along!  Why  don't you keep up?'       There was no answer. Fear  took him,  and he ran back  past the  stones  shouting  wildly: 'Sam!  Sam! Merry! Pippin!' The pony bolted into  the mist   and vanished."
