Though Orcs will often pursue foes  for many leagues into the plain, if they have a fallen captain to avenge.'       Frodo  did not answer. He looked at Sting, and the blade  was dull. Yet  he had heard something, or thought he had. As soon a s the shadows had fallen   ####-about them and the  road behind was dim, he had heard again the quick patter  of feet. Even now he heard it. He turned swiftly. There were two tiny gleams  of light behind, or for a moment he thought he  saw  them, but at once  they  slipped aside and vanished.       `What is it? ' said the dwarf.        `I don't know.' answered Frodo. 'I thought I heard feet,  and I thought  I saw a light -like  eyes. I  have thought so  often, since we first  entered  Moria.'       Gimli  halted and  stooped  to  the  ground. 'I  hear  nothing but  the  night-speech of plant  and stone,'  he said. 'Come! Let us hurry! The others  are out of sight.'       The  night-wind  blew  chill up the valley to  meet them. Before them a   wide  grey shadow loomed, and  they heard an endless  rustle of leaves  like  poplars in the breeze.       `Lothlurien! ' cried Legolas. 'Lothlurien! We have come to the eaves of  the Golden Wood. Alas that it is winter! '       Under  the night the trees stood tall before them, arched over the road  and stream that  ran suddenly  beneath their  spreading  boughs. In  the dim  light of  the stars their stems were grey, and their quivering leaves a hint  of fallow gold.       'Lothlurien! '  said  Aragorn. 'Glad I am to hear again the wind in the  trees! We are still little more than five leagues from the Gates, but we can  go no further. Here  let  us hope that the virtue of the Elves will  keep us  tonight from the peril that comes behind.'       `If Elves indeed still dwell here in the darkening world,' said Gimli.       'It is long since any  of my own folk journeyed hither back to the land  whence we wandered in ages long ago,' said Legolas, 'but we hear that Lurien  is not yet deserted, for there is a  secret power here  that holds evil from  the land.  Nevertheless its folk are seldom  seen, and maybe they  dwell now   deep in the woods and far from the northern border.'       'Indeed deep  in the  wood they dwell,' said Aragorn, and sighed as  if  some memory stirred in him. `We must fend for ourselves tonight.  We will go  forward a short way, until the trees are all about us, and then we will turn  aside from the path and seek a place to rest in.'       He stepped forward; but Boromir  stood irresolute and did  not  follow.   'Is there no other way?  ' he said.       `What other fairer way would you desire? ' said Aragorn.   ####-     `A plain road, though it  led through a hedge of swords,' said Boromir.  `By  strange  paths has this Company been  led, and so far  to evil fortune.  Against my will we passed under the shades of Moria, to our loss. And now we  must enter the Golden Wood, you say. But of that perilous land we have heard  in  Gondor, and it is said that few come out who once go in; and of that few   none have escaped unscathed.'       `Say not unscathed, but if you say unchanged, then maybe you will speak  the truth said Aragorn. But lore wanes in Gondor, Boromir, if in the city of  those who once were wise they now speak evil of Lothlurien. Believe what you   will,  there  is no other  way  for  us  --  unless  you  would  go  back  to  Moria -gate, or  scale the pathless mountains, or swim the  Great  River  all  alone.'       `Then lead on! ' said Boromir. `But it is perilous.'       `Perilous indeed,' said Aragorn, 'fair and perilous; but only evil need  fear it, or those who bring some evil with them. Follow me!  '       They  had gone  little more than a mile into the  forest when they came  upon  another  stream flowing  down swiftly from  the tree-clad  slopes that  climbed back westward towards the mountains.  They heard it splashing over a   fall away among the shadows on  their  right. Its dark  hurrying waters  ran  across the path before  them, and joined  the Silverlode in a  swirl  of dim  pools among the roots of trees.        `Here is Nimrodel! ' said  Legolas.  'Of this stream  the Silvan  Elves  made  many songs long ago, and still we sing them  in the North, remembering  the rainbow on its falls, and the  golden flowers  that floated in its foam.  All is  dark now  and the Bridge of Nimrodel is broken down. I will bathe my  feet, for it  is said that  the water is  healing to  the  weary.'  He  went  forward and climbed down the deep-cloven bank and stepped into the stream.       `Follow me!' he  cried. 'The water is not deep. Let us wade  across! On  the  further bank we can rest. and  the sound of the falling water may bring  us sleep and forgetfulness of grief.'       One by one they  climbed down and followed Legolas. For  a moment Frodo  stood near the brink and let the water flow over his tired feet."
