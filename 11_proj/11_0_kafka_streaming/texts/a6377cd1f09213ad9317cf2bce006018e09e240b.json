Cowering back  against the rock   they drew breath, and then they clutched at their  hearts.  Perching  now on  the wall  beside the ruined  gate the Nazgyl sent out its  deadly cries. All  the cliffs echoed.       In terror they  stumbled  on. Soon the road bent sharply eastward again  and exposed them  for  a dreadful  moment  to view from  the Tower. As  they  flitted  across they  glanced  back  and saw the  great black shape upon the  battlement; then they plunged down between high rock -walls in a cu tting that  fell steeply to join  the  Morgul-road. They came to  the way-meeting. There  was still  no sign of orcs, nor  of  an answer to the cry of the Nazgyl; but  they  knew that the silence would not last  long. At any moment now the hunt  would begin.       'This won't do, Sam,' said Frodo. 'If we were real orcs, we ought to be  dashing back  to the  Tower, not running away. The  first enemy we meet will  know us. We must get off this road somehow.'       'But we can't,' said Sam, 'not without wings.'       The eastern faces of the Ephel DÂ®ath  were  sheer, falling in cliff and  precipice to the black trough that lay between  them  and the inner ridge. A  short way beyond the  way-meeting,  after another  steep  incline,  a flying  bridge  of stone  leapt over the chasm  and  bore  the road  across into the  tumbled slopes and glens of the Morgai. With a desperate spurt Frodo and Sam  dashed along the bridge;  but  they had  hardly reached its further end when  they  heard  the hue and cry begin. Away  behind them, now high above on the  mountain-side, loomed  the  Tower of Cirith Ungol, its stones glowing dully.  Suddenly its harsh bell clanged  again, and  then broke  into  a  shattering  peal.  Horns sounded.  And now  from beyond  the  bridge-end came   answering  cries. Down in the dark trough,  cut off from the dying  glare of  Orodruin,   ####-Frodo  and  Sam  could not see ahead, but  already  they heard the  tramp of  iron-shod feet, and upon the road there rang the swift clatter of hoofs.       'Quick, Sam!  Over we  go!'  cried Frodo. They scrambled  on to  the low  parapet of the  bridge. Fortunately there  was no  longer any dreadful  drop  into the  gulf, for the slopes of the Morgai had already risen almost to the  level of the road;  but it was too dark for them to  guess  the depth of the  fall.       'Well, here goes, Mr. Frodo,' said Sam. 'Good-bye!'       He let go. Frodo followed. And even as they fell they heard the rush of  horsemen sweeping over  the bridge  and  the rattle  of orc-feet  running up  behind. But Sam would have laughed, if he had dared. Half fearing a breaking  plunge down on to unseen rocks the hobbits landed, in a drop of no more than  a dozen feet, with a thud  and  a crunch  into the last  thing that they had  expected: a tangle of thorny bushes.  There Sam  lay still, softly sucking a   scratched hand.       When  the sound of  hoof  and foot  had passed  he ventured a  whisper.  'Bless me, Mr. Frodo, but I didn't know as anything grew in Mordor! But if I  had a'known, this is just what I'd have  looked  for. These thorns must be a   foot long by the feel of them; they've stuck through everything I've got on.  Wish I'd a'put that mail -shirt on!'       'Orc-mail  doesn't keep  these thorns out,'  said Frodo.  'Not  even  a   leather jerkin is any good.'       They had a  struggle  to get out of the thicket. The thorns  and briars  were as tough as wire and as  clinging as  claws. Their cloaks were rent and  tattered before they broke free at last.       'Now down we  go, Sam,' Frodo whispered. 'Down into  the  valley quick ,  and then turn northward, as soon as ever we can.'       Day was coming again in the world outside, and far beyond the glooms of  Mordor the Sun  was climbing over the eastern  rim of Middle-earth; but here  all was still dark as night. The Mountain smoulder ed and its fires went out.  The glare  faded from the cliffs.  The easterly wind that  had  been blowing  ever since  they  left  Ithilien now seemed dead.  Slowly and painfully they  clambered down, groping, stumbling, scrambling among rock and briar and  dead  wood in the blind shadows, down and down until they could go no further.       At  length they stopped, and sat  side  by  side, their backs against a   boulder. Both were sweating.  'If Shagrat himself was to offer me a glass of   ####-water, I'd shake his hand,' said Sam.       'Don't say such things!' said Frodo. 'It only makes it  worse.' Then he  stretched himself out, dizzy and weary, and he spoke no more for a while. At  last with a struggle he got up again. To his amazement he found that Sam was  asleep.  'Wake  up,  Sam!'  he  said. 'Come on! It's time  we  made  another  effort.'       Sam scrambled  to  his feet.  'Well I  never!' he  said.  'I  must have  dropped off."
