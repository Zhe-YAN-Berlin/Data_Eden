At  first  it seemed  to  the hobbits  that  although  they walked  and  stumbled until  they were weary, they were creeping forward like snails, and   getting nowhere. Each  day  the land looked much the same as  it had the day  before. Yet steadily the  mountains were drawing nearer. South  of Rivendell  they rose ever higher, and bent westwards; and about the  feet  of the  main  range there was tumbled an ever  wider land of bleak hills, and deep valleys  filled with turbulent waters. Paths were few and winding, and led them often   only to the edge of some sheer fall, or down into treacherous swamps.        They had been a fortnight on the way when the weather changed. The wind  suddenly fell and then  veered round to  the south. The swift -flowing clouds  lifted and melted away, and the sun came out,  pale and bright. There came a  cold clear dawn  at the  end of a long stumbling night-march. The travellers  reached a low ridge crowned with ancient holly -trees whose grey-green trunks  seemed to have  been  bu ilt  out of the very  stone of the hills. Their dark  leaves shone and their berries glowed red in the light of the rising sun.       Away  in the  south Frodo could  see the  dim shapes of lofty mountains  that seemed now to stand across the path that the Company was taking. At the  left of this high  range rose three peaks; the  tallest and nearest stood up  like a tooth tipped with snow; its great, bare, northern precipice was still  largely  in the  shadow, but where the sunlight slanted upon  it,  it glowed  red.       Gandalf stood  at Frodo's side and  looked out under his hand. `We have  done well,' he said.  `We have reached the borders of the country  that  Men  call Hollin; many Elves lived here  in happier  days,  when Eregion was  its  name.  Five-and-forty leagues as the crow flies we  have come,  though  many  long miles further our feet  have walked. The land and the weather  will  be  milder now, but perhaps all the more dangerous.'       `Dangerous or  not, a  real sunrise  is  mighty  welcome,'  said Frodo,  throwing back his hood and letting the morning light fall on his face.       'But the mountains  are ahead of us,' said Pippin. `We must have turned  eastwards in the night.'   ####-     'No,'  said Gandalf. 'But you  see further ahead in  the  clear  light.  Beyond those peaks the range bends round south-west. There are  many maps  in  Elrond's house, but I suppose you never thought to look at them?'       `Yes I did, sometimes,' said Pippin, `but I don't remember them.  Frodo  has a better head for that sort of thing.'       `I need no map,' said  Gimli, who  had come  up  with Legolas,  and was  gazing out before him with a strange  light in his deep eyes. `There is  the  land where our fathers worked of old, and we have wrought the image of those  mountains  into many works of metal  and of  stone, and into  many songs and  tales. They stand tall in our dreams: Baraz, Zirak, Shathyr.       `Only once before have I seen them from afar in waking life, but I know  them and their names, for under them lies  Khazad-dym, the Dwarrowdelf, that  is  now  called  the Black Pit,  Moria in the Elvish  tongue.  Yonder stands  Barazinbar, the  Redhorn, cruel Caradhras; and beyond him are Silvertine and  Cloudyhead: Celebdil  the  White,  and  Fanuidhol  the Grey,  that  we  call  Zirak-zigil and Bundushathyr.       `There the  Misty  Mountains  divide, and between  their  arms lies the  deep-shadowed valley  which we cannot forget: Azanulbizar, the Dimrill Dale,  which the Elves call Nanduhirion.'       `It is for the Dimrill Dale  that we are  making,' said Gandalf. `If we  climb  the  pass that  is called the Redhorn Gate, under  the  far  side  of  Caradhras, we shall come down by the Dimrill Stair into the deep vale of the   Dwarves. There lies the Mirrormere, and there the River Silverlode rises  in  its icy springs.'       `Dark is  the water  of  Kheled-zvram,' said Gimli, `and  cold are  the  springs of Kibil-nvla. My  heart trembles at the thought that I may see them  soon.'       `May you have  joy of the sight, my good  dwarf  l' said  Gandalf.   'But  whatever you may do, we at least cannot stay in that valley. We must go down  the Silverlode into the secret woods, and so  to the Great  River,  and then   --'       He paused.       'Yes, and where then?' asked Merry.       'To the end of the  journey -- in the  end,' said  Gandalf.  'We cannot  look too  far ahead. Let us be glad that  the first stage is safely over.  I  think we  will rest here, not only today but  tonight as  well. There  is  a    ####-wholesome air about Hollin. Much evil must befall a country before it wholly  forgets the Elves, if once they dwelt there.'       'That is true,' said Legolas. `But  the Elves of  this land  were of  a   race strange to  us  of the  silvan folk, and the trees and the grass do not  now remember them: Only I hear the stones  lament them: deep they delved us,  fair  they wrought  us,  high they  builded us;  but they are gone."
