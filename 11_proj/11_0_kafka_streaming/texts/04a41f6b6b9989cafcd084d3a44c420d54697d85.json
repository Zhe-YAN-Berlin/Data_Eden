  "text": " Potter and Miss Granger,\" said Dumbledore calmly. \"I have just been talking to Sirius Black --\"  \"I suppose he's told you the same fairy tale he's planted in Potter's mind?\" spat Snape. \"Something about a rat, and Pettigrew being alive --\"  \"That, indeed, is Black's story,\" said Dumbledore, surveying Snape closely through his half-moon spectacles.  \"And does my evidence count for nothing?\" snarled Snape. \"Peter Pettigrew was not in the Shrieking Shack, nor did I see any sign of him on the grounds.\"  \"That was because you were knocked out, Professor!\" said Hermione earnestly. \"You didn't arrive in time to hear  \"Miss Granger, HOLD YOUR TONGUE!\"  \"Now, Snape,\" said Fudge, startled, \"the young lady is disturbed in her mind, we must make allowances --\"  \"I would like to speak to Harry and Hermione alone,\" said Dumbledore abruptly. \"Cornelius, Severus, Poppy -- please leave us.\"  \"Headmaster!\" sputtered Madam Pomfrey. \"They need treatment, they need rest --\"  \"This cannot wait,\" said Dumbledore. \"I must insist.\"  Madam Pomfrey pursed her lips and strode away into her office at the end of the ward, slamming the door behind her. Fudge consulted the large gold pocket watch dangling from his waistcoat.  \"The dementors should have arrived by now,\" he said. \"I'll go and meet them. Dumbledore, I'll see you upstairs.\"  He crossed to the door and held it open for Snape, but Snape hadn't moved.  \"You surely don't believe a word of Black's story?\" Snape whispered, his eyes fixed on Dumbledore's face.  \"I wish to speak to Harry and Hermione alone,\" Dumbledore repeated.  Snape took a step toward Dumbledore.  \"Sirius Black showed he was capable of murder at the age of sixteen,\" he breathed. \"You haven't forgotten that, Headmaster? You haven't forgotten that he once tried to kill me?\"  \"My memory is as good as it ever was, Severus,\" said Dumbledore quietly.  Snape turned on his heel and marched through the door Fudge was still holding. It closed behind them, and Dumbledore turned to Harry and Hermione. They both burst into speech at the same time.  \"Professor, Black's telling the truth -- we saw Pettigrew \"-- he escaped when Professor Lupin turned into a werewolf --\"  \"-- he's a rat --\"  \"-- Pettigrew's front paw, I mean, finger, he cut it off --\"  \"-- Pettigrew attacked Ron, it wasn't Sirius --\"  But Dumbledore held up his hand to stem the flood of explanations.  \"It is your turn to listen, and I beg you will not interrupt me, because there is very little time,\" he said quietly. \"There is not a shred of proof to support Black's story, except your word -- and the word of two thirteen-year-old wizards will not convince anybody. A street full of eyewitnesses swore they saw Sirius murder Pettigrew. I myself gave evidence to the Ministry that Sirius had been the Potters' Secret-Keeper.\"  \"Professor Lupin can tell you --\" Harry said, unable to stop himself  \"Professor Lupin is currently deep in the forest, unable to tell anyone anything. By the time he is human again, it will be too late, Sirius will be worse than dead. I might add that werewolves are so mistrusted by most of our kind that his support will count for very little -- and the fact that he and Sirius are old friends --\"  \"But --\"  \"Listen to me, Harry. It is too late, you understand me? You must see that Professor Snape's version of events is far more convincing than yours.\"  \"He hates Sirius,\" Hermione said desperately. \"All because of some stupid trick Sirius played on him --\"  \"Sirius has not acted like an innocent man. The attack on the Fat Lady -- entering Gryffindor Tower with a knife -- without Pettigrew, alive or dead, we have no chance of overturning Sirius's sentence.\"  \"But you believe us.\"  \"Yes, I do,\" said Dumbledore quietly. \"But I have no power to make other men see the truth, or to overrule the Minister of Magic....\"  Harry stared up into the grave face and felt as though the ground beneath him were falling sharply away. He had grown used to the idea that Dumbledore could solve anything. He had expected Dumbledore to pull some amazing solution out of the air. But no ... their last hope was gone.  \"What we need,\" said Dumbledore slowly, and his light blue eyes moved from Harry to Hermione, \"is more time.\"  \"But --\" Hermione began. And then her eyes became very round. \"OH!\"  \"Now, pay attention,\" said Dumbledore, speaking very low, and very clearly. \"Sirius is locked in Professor Flitwick's office on the seventh floor. Thirteenth window from the right of the West Tower. If all goes well, you will be able to save more than one innocent life tonight. But remember this, both of you: you must not be seen. Miss Granger, you know the law -- you know what is at stake.... You -- must -- not -- be -- seen.\"  Harry didn't have a clue what was going on. Dumbledore had turned on his heel and looked back as he reached the door.  \"I am going to lock you in. It is --\" he consulted his watch, \"five minutes to midnight. Miss Granger, three turns should do it. Good luck.\"  \"Good luck?\" Harry repeated as the door closed behind Dumbledore."
