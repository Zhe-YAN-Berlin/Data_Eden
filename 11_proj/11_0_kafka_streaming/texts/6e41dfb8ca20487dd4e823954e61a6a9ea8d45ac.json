They  gathered such small boulders and broken stones as they could find   to hand, and under  Gimli's direction  the Westfold-men blocked up the inner  end  of  the  culvert,  until  only  a  narrow  outlet  remained.  Then  the  Deeping-stream, swollen by the rain, churned and fretted in its choked path,   and spread slowly in cold pools from cliff to cliff.       'It will  be drier above,' said  Gimli. 'Come, Gamling, let us see  how  things go on the wall!'       He  climbed up and  found Legolas beside Aragorn and Jomer. The elf was   ####-whetting his long knife. There was  for a while a lull in the assault, since  the attempt to break in through the culvert had been foiled.       'Twenty-one!' said Gimli.       'Good!' said  Legolas.  'But my count  is  now  two  dozen. It has been  knife-work up here.'       Jomer  and Aragorn  leant wearily on their swo rds. Away on the left the  crash  and  clamour  of the battle  on the Rock rose  loud  again.  But  the  Hornburg still held fast, like an island in the sea.  Its gates lay in ruin;  but over  the  barricade of  beams and  stones  within no  enemy  as yet had  passed.       Aragorn  looked at the pale stars, and  at the moon, now sloping behind  the  western  hills that enclosed  the valley. 'This is a  night  as long as  years,' he said. 'How long will the day tarry?'       'Dawn is not far off,' said Gamling, who had now climbed up beside him.  'But dawn will not help us, I fear.'       'Yet dawn is ever the hope of men,' said Aragorn.       'But these creatures of  Isengard, these half-orcs and  goblin-men that  the foul craft of Saruman  has bred, they will not quail at the  sun,'  said  Gamling. 'And neither will  the wild men of the hills. Do you not hear their  voices?'       'I  hear them,' said  Jomer; 'but they are only the scream of birds and  the bellowing of beasts to my ears.'       'Yet  there  are many that cry in the Dunland tongue,' said Gamling. 'I   know that tongue.  It is an ancient speech  of men, and  once  was spoken in   many western valleys of the Mark. Hark! They hate us, and they are glad; for  our doom seems certain to them. 'The king the king!' they cry. 'We will take  their king.  Death to the Forgoil!  Death  to the Strawheads! Death  to  the   robbers of the North!'  Such names they have for  us. Not in half a thousand  years have they forgotten their  grievance that the lords of Gondor gave the  Mark to  Eorl the  Young and  made alliance with him. That old hatred Saruman  has  inflamed. They are fierce folk when roused. They  will not give way now  for dusk or dawn, until Thjoden is taken, or they themselves are slain.'       'Nonetheless day will bring hope to me,' said Aragorn.  'Is it not said  that no foe has ever taken the Hornburg, if men defended it?'       'So the minstrels say,' said Jomer.       'Then let us defend it, and hope!' said Aragorn.       Even as they  spoke there came a blare  of trumpets. Then there  was  a    ####-crash  and a flash of  flame and  smoke. The waters  of  the  Deeping-stream  poured out  hissing and  foaming: they were choked no longer, a gaping  hole  was blasted in the wall. A host of dark shapes poured in.       'Devilry of Saruman! ' cried  Aragorn.  'They have crept  in the culvert  again, while  we talked, and  they have  lit the fire of Orthanc beneath our  feet. Elendil, Elendil!' he shouted, as he leaped down into  the breach; but  even as he  did  so  a hundred ladders were raised  against the  battlements.   Over the wall and under  the wall the last assault came sweeping like a dark  wave upon a hill of  sand. The  defence  was  swept away. Some of the Riders  were driven back, further and further into the Deep, falling and fighting a s  they gave way, step  by step, towards the caves.  Others cut  their way back   towards the citadel.       A  broad  stairway,  climbed  from  the Deep  up  to the  Rock and  the  rear-gate of the Hornburg. Near the bottom stood  Aragorn. In his hand still  AndÂ®ril gleamed,  and  the terror of  the sword  for a while  held  back the  enemy,  as one by one all who  could  gain the  stair passed up  towards the  gate. Behind  on the upper  steps knelt Legolas. His bow  was  bent, but one   gleaned arrow  was all that he had left,  and he  peered out now,  ready  to  shoot the first Orc that should dare to approach the stair.       'All  who  can  have now got safe  within, Aragorn,' he  called.  'Come  back!'       Aragorn turned and sped up the stair; but as  he ran he stumbled in his  weariness. At once  his  enemies  leapt forward. Up  came the Orcs, yelling,   with  their  long arms stretched out to  seize  him. The foremost  fell with  Legolas' last  arrow in his  throat. but the rest sprang  over  him.  Then a   great boulder, cast from the outer wall above,  crashed down upon the stair,  and hurled them back into the Deep."
