'I came  west with him  in the spring.  I have often kept watch  on  the borders of the Shire in the  last few years,  when he was busy elsewhere. He seldom left it unguarded. We  last met on the first  of May: at  Sam  Ford down the Brandywine. He told me  that his business with you had gone well, and that you would be starting for   Rivendell in the last week  of September. As I knew  he  was at your side, I  went away on a journey of my own. And that has proved ill;  for plainly some  news reached him, and I was not at hand to help.       'I am troubled, for the  first time  since I have known  him. We should  have had messages, even if he  could not come himself. When I returned, many  days  ago, I heard the ill  news.  The tidings had gone  far  and wide  that  Gandalf was missing and the horsemen had been seen. It was the Elven-folk of  Gildor that told me this;  and  later  they told me that you had  left  your  home; but there was no news of your leaving Buckland. I  have  been watching  the East Road anxiously.'       'Do  you  think  the Black Riders  have  anything to do  with it  - with  Gandalf's absence, I mean?' asked Frodo.       'I  do  not know of anything else  that could have hindered him, except  the  Enemy himself,'  said  Strider. 'But do not give  up  hope! Gandalf  is  greater than you Shire-folk know  -  as a rule you can only see his jokes and  toys. But this business of ours will be his greatest task.'       Pippin yawned. 'I am sorry,' he said, 'but I am dead tired. In spite of  all  the danger and worry  I must go to  bed, or sleep where I sit. Where is  that silly fellow, Merry? It would be the last straw, if we had to go out in  the dark to look for him.'       At that moment they heard a door slam; then feet came running along the  passage. Merry came  in  with a  rush followed  by  Nob.  He shut  the  door   hastily, and leaned against it. He was out of breath. They  stared at him in  alarm for  a moment before he gasped: 'I have seen  them, Frodo! I have seen  them! Black Riders!'       'Black Riders!' cried Frodo. 'Where?'       'Here. In the village. I  stayed indoors for  an  hour. Then as you did   ####-not  come  back, I  went out  for a  stroll.  I  had come back again and was  standing just outside the light of the lamp looking at the stars. Suddenly I  shivered and felt that something horrible was creeping near: there was a son  of deeper shade among the shadows across the  road, just beyond the edge  of  the lamplight. It slid away at once into the dark without a sound. There was  no horse.'       'Which  way  did  it  go?'  asked Strider, suddenly  and sharply. Merry  started, noticing the  stranger for the  first  time. 'Go  on!' said  Frodo.  'This is a friend of Gandalf's. I will explain later.'       'It seemed to make  off  up  the  Road,  eastward,' continued Merry. 'I   tried to follow. Of course, it vanished almost at once; but I went round the  corner and on as far as the last house on the Road.'       Strider looked at Merry with wonder. 'You have a stout heart,' he said;  'but it was foolish.'       'I don't know,' said Merry. 'Neither brave nor silly, I  think. I could  hardly  help myself.  I  seemed to be drawn  somehow.  Anyway,  I  went, and  suddenly I heard voices by the hedge. One was muttering; and the  other  was  whispering,  or  hissing. I  couldn't hear a word  that was said. I did  not  creep  any  closer,  because  I  began  to  tremble  all over. Then  I  felt  terrified,  and I  turned  back,  and was  just  going  to  bolt  home, when  something came behind me and I... I fell over.'       'I  found  him,  sir,'  put in Nob.  'Mr. Butterbur sent me out with  a   lantern. I went down to West -gate, and then back up towards South-gate. Just  nigh  Bill Ferny's  house I thought  I could see  something in  the  Road. I   couldn't swear to  it, but it  looked to me as if two men was  stooping over   something, lilting  it. I gave a shout, but where I got up to the spot there  was  no  signs  of them,  and only Mr. Brandybuck lying by  the roadside. He  seemed to be asleep. \"I thought I had  fallen into  deep  water,\" he says to  me, when I shook him. Very queer he was, and as soon as I had roused him, he  got up and ran back here like a hare. '       'I am  afraid that's true,'  said Merry, 'though I  don't know  what  I  said. I had an ugly dream, which I can't remember. I went to pieces. I don't   know what came over me.'       'I  do,' said Strider.  'The Black Breath. The  Riders  must have  left  their horses outside, and passed back through the South-gate in secret. They   will know all the news now, for  they have visited  Bill Ferny; and probably   that Southerner was a spy as well. Something may happen in the night, before   ####-we leave Bree.'       'What  will happen?'  said  Merry."
