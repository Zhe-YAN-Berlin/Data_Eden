  "text": " I begin to see  it even  with my waking  eyes, and all else fades.'       Sam went  to him and kissed his hand. 'Then the sooner we're rid of it,  the sooner  to rest,'  he said  haltingly, finding no  better  words to say.  'Talking won't mend nothing,' he muttered to himself,  as he gathered up all  the  things  that they had chosen to cast away. He was  not willing to leave  them lying open in the wilderness  for any eyes  to see. 'Stinker picked  up  that  orc-shirt,  seemingly,  and he  isn't going to add a sword  to it. His  hands are bad enough when  empty. And he isn't going to mess  with my pans!'  With  that he carried all  the gear away to  one of the many gaping fissures  that scored  the land and thr ew them in. The clatter of his precious pans as  they fell down into the dark was like a death-knell to his heart.       He came back to Frodo, and then of his elven -rope he  cut a short piece  to  serve his master  as a girdle and bind  the grey cloak close  about  his  waist. The rest he carefully coiled and put back in his pack. Beside that he  kept  only the remnants of  their waybread  and the  water -bottle, and Sting  still hanging by his belt; and hidden away in a pocket of his tunic next his  breast the ph ial of Galadriel and the  little box that  she gave him for his   ####-own.       Now  at  last  they turned  their faces to  the Mountain  and  set out,  thinking no more of concealment,  bending  their weariness and failing wills  only  to the  one task of going on. In  the dimness  of  its dreary day  few  things even  in  that land  of  vigilance could have espied them, save  from  close  at hand. Of all the slaves of  the  Dark  Lord, only the Nazgyl could  have warned him of the  peril  that crept, small  but  indomitable, into the  very  heart of his  guarded realm. But the Nazgyl and their black wings were  abroad on another errand: they  were  gathered far away, shadowing the march  of  the Captains of the West, and thither the  thought of the Dark Tower was  turned .       That day it seemed to Sam that his master  had found some new strength,   more than could be explained by the small lightening of the load that he had  to carry.  In  the first marches they  went  further and faster than he  had  hoped. The land was rough  and hostile, and yet they made much progress, and  ever the Mountain drew nearer.  But as the  day wore on and all too soon the   dim light began to fail,  Frodo stooped again, and  began to stagger, as  if  the renewed effort had squandered his remaining strength.       At  their last halt he sank down and said: 'I'm thirsty,  Sam,' and did  not speak  again. Sam gave him  a mouthful  of water; only one more mouthful  remained. He went without himself; and now as once more the  night of  Mordor   closed over  them, through all his thoughts there came  the memory of water;  and every brook  or  stream or fount  that he  had  ever  seen, under  green  willow-shades or twinkling in  the sun, danced  and rippled for his  torment  behind the blindness of his eyes. He felt the cool mud about his toes  as he  paddled in the Pool at Bywater with Jolly Cotton and Tom and Nibs, and their  sister  Rosie. 'But that was years  ago,'  he sighed, 'and far away. The way  back, if there is one, goes past the Mountain.'       He could not sleep and he held a  debate with himself. 'Well, come now,   we've done better than you hoped,' he said sturdily.  'Began  well anyway. I  reckon we  crossed half the distance before we stopped. One more day will do  it.' And then he paused.       'Don't  be a  fool, Sam Gamgee,' came  an answer  in  his own voice. 'He  won't go another day like that, if he moves at all. And you can't go on much   longer giving him all the water and most of the food.'       'I can go on a good way though, and I will.'   ####-     'Where to? '       'To the Mountain, of course.'       'But what then, Sam Gamgee, what then? When you get there, what are you   going to do? He won't be able to do anything for himself.'       To his dismay Sam realized that he  had not  got an answer  to this. He  had no clear idea  at all. Frodo  had not spoken much to him  of his errand,  and Sam only knew vaguely that the Ring had somehow to be put into the fire.  'The Cracks of  Doom,' he muttered, the old name rising  to his mind. 'Well,  if Master knows how to find them, I don't.'       'There you are!' came the answer. 'It's  all quite useless.  He said so  himself. You are the fool, going on hoping and  toiling. You could have lain  down and gone to sleep  together days ago, if you hadn't been so dogged. But  you'll die just the same, or worse. You might just as well lie down  now and  give it up. You'll never get to the top anyway.'       'I'll get there, if  I leave everything but my bones behind,' said Sam.  'And I'll carry Mr. Frodo up myself, if it breaks my back and heart. So stop  arguing!'       At  that moment Sam felt a  tremor in the  ground  beneath  him, and he  heard or  sensed a deep remote rumble as  of  thunder  imprisoned  under the   earth."
