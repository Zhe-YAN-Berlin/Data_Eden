Where  all had looked so shabby  and grey before, the wood now gleamed with rich browns, and with the   smooth  black-greys  of bark  like polished leather.  The boles of the trees  glowed  with a soft green like young grass: early spring or  a fleeting vision of it  was about them.       In the face of the stony wall there was something like a stair: natural  perhaps, and  made by the weathering  and splitting  of the rock, for it was  rough and uneven. High up, almost level with the tops of forest -trees, there   ####-was a shelf under a cliff. Nothing grew there but a few grasses and weeds at  its edge, and  one old stump of a tree  with only two bent branches left: it  looked almost  like the figure  of some gnarled  old  man,  standing  there,  blinking in the morning-light.       'Up  we go!' said Merry joyfully. 'Now for a breath of air, and a sight  of the land!'       They climbed  and scrambled up the rock. If the  stair had been made it  was for bigger feet and longer legs than theirs. They were  too eager to  be  surprised at the  remarkable  way  in  which the  cuts  and  sores of  their  captivity  had healed and their  vigour had returned. They came at length to  the edge  of the shelf almost at the feet of the old stump; then they sprang  up  and  turned  round  with their backs  to the  hill, breathing  deep, and  looking  out eastward. They saw  that they had  only come some three or four  miles  into the  forest:  the heads  of the  trees marched  down  the slopes  towards the  plain. There, near the fringe  of  the forest,  tall spires  of  curling black smoke went up, wavering and floating towards them.       'The wind's changing,'  said Merry.  'It's  turned east again. It feels  cool up here.'       'Yes,'  said Pippin; 'I'm  afraid this is only a passing  gleam, and it  will  all go grey  again. What a  pity! This  shaggy  old  forest  looked so  different in the sunlight. I almost felt I liked the place.'       'Almost felt you liked the  Forest! That's good! That's uncommonly kind  of you,' said  a strange voice.  'Turn round and let  me have a look at your  faces. I almost feel that  I dislike you  both, but do  not let us be hasty.  Turn round!' A large knob-knuckled hand was laid on each of their shoulders,   and they  were twisted round,  gently but irresistibly; then  two great arms  lifted them up.       They  found that they  were looking  at a  most extraordinary face.  It  belonged to a  large  Man-like, almost Troll-like, figure, at least fourteen  foot high,  very sturdy, with a tall  head,  and hardly any neck. Whether it  was clad in stuff like green  and grey  bark, or  whether that was its hide,  was  difficult to say. At any  rate the  arms, at a short distance from  the  trunk, were not wrinkled,  but covered  with a brown smooth skin.  The large  feet had seven toes each. The lower part of the long face was covered with a   sweeping grey beard, bushy, almost twiggy  at the roots,  thin and mossy  at  the  ends. But  at  the moment the hobbits noted little but the eyes.  These  deep  eyes  were now  surveying them, slow and solemn, but very penetrating.   ####-They were brown, shot  with a green light. Often  afterwards Pippin tried to  describe his first impression of them.       'One felt  as if there was an enormous well behind them, filled up with  ages of  memory  and long, slow,  steady  thinking;  but  their surface  was  sparkling with  the present: like sun shimmering on the  outer  leaves of  a   vast tree, or on the ripples of a very deep lake.  I don't know but it  felt  as  if  something  that grew  in the  ground-asleep, you might say, or  just   feeling itself  as  something between  roof-tip  and leaf-tip, between  deep  earth  and sky had suddenly waked up, and was  considering you with the same  slow care that it had given to its own inside affairs for endless years.'       'Hrum, Hoom,'  murmured  the  voice,  a deep  voice  like a  very  deep  woodwind  instrument. 'Very odd indeed! Do  not  be hasty, that is my motto.  But if I had seen you,  before I heard your voices-I liked them: nice little  voices: they reminded me of something I cannot  remember ---if I had seen you   before I heard you, I should have just trodden on you, taking you for little  Orcs, and found out my mistake  afterwards. Very odd  you  are, indeed. Root  and twig, very odd!'       Pippin, though still amazed, no longer felt afraid. Under those eyes he  felt a curious suspense, but  not fear. 'Please.' he said, 'who are you? And  what are you?'       A queer look came into the old eyes, a kind of wariness; the deep wells  were covered over.  'Hrum, now,' answered the voice;  'well,  I am an Ent, or   that's  what  they call me.  Yes, Ent is the word. The Ent, I am,  you might  say,  in your  manner  of  speaking."
