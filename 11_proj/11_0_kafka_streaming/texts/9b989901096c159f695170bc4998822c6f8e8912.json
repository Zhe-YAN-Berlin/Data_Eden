He was so eager to lay his hands on his  prey that he could not wait at home, and he came forth to meet and to spy on   his messengers. But he came too late, for once,  and the battle was over and  beyond his help before he reached these parts. He did not  remain here long.   I  look into  his mind and I see his doubt. He has no woodcraft. He believes  that the horsemen slew and burned all  upon the field of battle; but he does  not know whether  the Orcs were bringing any  prisoners or not. And  he does  not know of  the  quarrel between his  servants and the Orcs  of Mordor; nor   does he know of the Winged Messenger.'       'The Winged  Messenger!' cried  Legolas. 'I shot at him with the bow of  Galadriel above Sarn Gebir, and I felled  him from the sky. He filled us all  with fear. What new terror is this?'       'One that you cannot slay with arrows,'  said  Gandalf. 'You on ly  slew  his steed.  It was a good deed; but the Rider was soon horsed again.  For he  was a Nazgyl, one of  the Nine, who ride now upon winged  steeds. Soon their  terror will overshadow the last armies of  our friends, cutting off the sun.  But they have not yet been allowed to cross the River, and  Saruman does not  know of this new shape  in which the Ringwraiths have been clad. His thought  is ever on  the Ring.  Was  it  present in the battle? Was it found? What if  Thjoden, Lord of the Mark, should come by  it and learn of its power? That is  the danger that he  sees,  and  he  has fled  back to Isengard to double and  treble his assault on Rohan. And all the time there is another danger, close  at  hand,  which  he does  not  see, busy  with his fiery  thoughts. He  has  forgotten Treebeard.'       'Now  you  speak  to  yourself  again,'  said  Aragorn  with  a  smile.  'Treebeard is not known to me. And I have guessed part of  Saruman's  double  treachery; yet I do not see in what way the coming of two hobbits to Fangorn  has served, save to give us a long and fruitless chase.'       'Wait a minute!'  cried Gimli. 'There  is another  thing that  I should  like to know first. Was it you, Gandalf, or Saruman that we saw last night?'       'You  certainly did  not see me, '  answered Gandalf,  'therefore I must   guess that you saw Saruman. Evidently we look so much alike that your desire  to make an incurable dent in my hat must be excused.'       'Good, good!' said Gimli. 'I am glad that it was not you.'       Gandalf laughed again. 'Yes, my good Dwarf,' he said, 'it is a  comfort  not to  be mistaken at all  points. Do I not know  it only too well! But, of  course, I  never blamed you for your welcome of me. How  could I  do so, who   ####-have so  often  counselled  my friends to suspect even their  own hands when  dealing  with  the Enemy. Bless you, Gimli, son of Gluin! Maybe you will see  us both together one day and judge between us!'       'But  the hobbits!' Legolas broke in. 'We have  come far to seek  them,  and you seem to know where they are. Where are they now?'       'With Treebeard and the Ents,' said Gandalf.        'The Ents!' exclaimed  Aragorn. 'Then there is truth in the old legends  about the dwellers in the deep forests and the giant shepherds of the trees?   Are  there  still  Ents in the  world? I thought they were  only a memory of  ancient days, if indeed they were ever more than a legend of Rohan.'       'A legend  of Rohan!' cried  Legolas. 'Nay, every Elf in Wilderland has  sung songs of the old Onodrim and their long sorrow. Yet even among us  they  are only a memory. If I were to meet one  still walking in this  world, then  indeed I should feel young again! But Treebeard: that is only a rendering of  Fangorn into the Common Speech; yet you seem  to  speak of a  person. Who is  this Treebeard?'       'Ah! now you are asking much,' said Gandalf. 'The little that I know of  his long  slow  story would  make  a  tale for which we  have no  time  now.   Treebeard  is Fangorn, the  guardian of the  forest; he is the oldest of the  Ents, the oldest living thing that still  walks  beneath the Sun  upon  this  Middle-earth. I  hope indeed,  Legolas, that you may yet meet him. Merry and  Pippin have been fortunate: they  met  him here, even where  we sit. For  he   came here  two days ago  and bore  them away to his  dwelling far off by the   roots of the  mountains. He often  comes here, especially  when  his mind is  uneasy, and rumours of  the world outside trouble him. I  saw him  four days  ago striding among the trees, and  I  think he saw me, for he  paused; but I  did not  speak,  for I was heavy with  thought, and  weary after my struggle  with the Eye of Mordor; and he did not speak either, nor call my name.'       'Perhaps  he also thought that you were  Saruman,' said Gimli. 'But you   speak of  him as if he was a friend. I thought Fangorn was dangerous.'       'Dangerous!'  cried  Gandalf."
