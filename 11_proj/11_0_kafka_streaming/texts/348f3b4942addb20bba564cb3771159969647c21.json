  "text": " But  there are other reasons.' He  stepped forward,  but Gandalf stayed him  with  his hand.       'Jowyn is safe now,' he said. 'But you, Wormtongue,  you have done what  you could for  your  true master.  Some reward you have earned at least. Yet  Saruman is apt to  overlook his bargains. I should advise you  to go quickly  and remind him, lest he forget your faithful service.'       'You lie,' said Wormtongue.   ####-     'That word comes too oft and easy from  your lips,' said Gandalf. 'I do  not lie. See, Thjoden, here is a snake! With  safety you cannot take it with  you,  nor can you leave it behind. To slay it  would be just. But it was not  always as it now is. Once it was a man,  and did you service in its fashion.  Give him a horse and  let him go at once, wherever he chooses. By his choice  you shall judge him.'       'Do  you hear this, Wormtongue?' said Thjoden. 'This is your choice: to  ride with me to war, and let us see in battle whether you are true; or to go  now,  whither  you will. But  then, if ever we  meet again, I  shall not  be  merciful.'       Slowly Wormtongue rose. He  looked  at them with half-closed eyes. Last  of all he scanned Thjoden's face and opened his mouth  as if  to speak. Then   suddenly he drew  himself up.  His  hands  worked. His eyes glittered.  Such  malice was in them that men stepped  back from  him. He bared his teeth; and  then with a  hissing breath he spat before the king's feet, and  darting  to  one side, he fled down the stair.       'After him!' said Thjoden. 'See that he does no harm to any, but do not  hurt him or hinder him. Give him a horse, if he wishes it.'       'And if any will bear him,' said Jomer.       One of the guards ran down the stair.  Another went to the  well at the  foot of  the terrace and in his helm drew water. With it he washed clean the  stones that Wormtongue had defiled.       'Now my guests, come!' said Thjoden. 'Come and take such refreshment as  haste allows.'       They passed back into the great house. Already they heard below them in   the town the heralds crying and the  war -horns  blowing. For the king was to  ride forth as soon as the  men of the  town and those dwelling near could be  armed and assembled.       At the  king's  board sat  Jomer  and  the four guests, and there  also  waiting  upon  the king was  the lady Jowyn. They ate and drank swiftly. The  others were silent while Thjoden questioned Gandalf concerning Saruman.       'How far back his treachery goes, who can guess?' said Gandalf. 'He was  not always evil. Once  I  do not doubt that he  was the friend of Rohan; and  even when his heart grew colder, he found you useful still. But for long now  he  has plotted  your  ruin, wearing the  mask of Friendship,  until  he was  ready. In those years Wormtongue's task was easy, and all that  you did  was  swiftly known in Isengard; for your  land  was  open, and strangers came and   ####-went. And  ever Wormtongue's  whispering was  in your ears,  poisoning  your  thought, chilling your heart, weakening your limbs, while others watched and  could do nothing, for your will was in his keeping.       'But  when I escaped and  warned you, then the mask was torn, for those  who would see. After  that Wormtongue played dangerously, always  seeking  to  delay  you, to  prevent  your full strength being gathered.  He  was crafty:  dulling men's  wariness, or working on their fears,  as served the occasion.  Do you not remember how eagerly  he urged  that no man should be spared on  a  wildgoose  chase  northward,  when  the  immediate  peril was  westward?  He  persuaded you  to  forbid Jomer to pursue the raiding Orcs. If Jomer had not   defied  Wormtongue's voice speaking  with your mouth, those Orcs would   have  reached Isengard by now,  bearing a great prize. Not indeed that prize which   Saruman desires  above all else, but at the least two members of my Company,  sharers of a  secret hope, of  which even  to you,  lord, I cannot yet speak  openly. Dare you think of what they might now be  suffering, or what Saruman  might now have learned to our destruction?'       'I owe much to  Jomer,' said Thjoden. 'Faithful heart  may have forward  tongue.' 'Say also,' said  Gandalf,  'that to crooked  eyes truth may wear a   wry face.'       'Indeed my eyes were almost blind,' said Thjoden. 'Most of all I owe to  you, my guest. Once again you have come in time. I would give you a gift ere  we  go, at your own  choosing. You  have only to name aught  that is mine. I  reserve now only my sword!'       'Whether I came in time or not is yet  to be  seen,' said Gandalf. 'But  as for your gift, lord, I will choose  one that will fit my need: swift  and  sure. Give me Shadowfax! He was  only lent  before, if loan we may  call it.   But now shall ride  him into great hazard,  setting silver against  black: I  would not risk anything that is not my own.  And already there is  a bond of  love between us.'       'You choose  well,' said Thjoden; 'and I give him now gladly."
