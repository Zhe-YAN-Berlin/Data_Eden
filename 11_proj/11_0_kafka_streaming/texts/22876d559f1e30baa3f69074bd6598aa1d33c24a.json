  "text": "'       'Do you think he------' began Frodo.       'No,  I  don't  think any  harm  of old Butterbur.  Only  he  does  not  altogether like  mysterious vagabonds  of my sort.' Frodo gave him a puzzled  look. 'Well, I have rather a rascally look, have I not?' said Strider with a   curl of his lip and a  queer gleam in  his eye. 'But I  hope we shall get to   ####-know one another better.  When we do, I hope you will explain  what happened  at the end of your song. For that little prank ------'       'It was sheer accident!' interrupted Frodo.       'I wonder,' said Strider. 'Accident, then. That  accident has made your  position dangerous.'       'Hardly more than it  was already,' said Frodo.  'I knew these horsemen  were pursuing me;  but now  at any rate they seem to  have  missed me and to  have gone away.'       'You  must not count on that!' said Strider sharply. 'They will return.  And more  are  coming. There are others. I know their  number. I know  these  Riders.' He paused,  and his  eyes were cold and hard. 'And there  are  some  folk  in Bree who  are  not to be  trusted,'  he went on.  'Bill  Ferny, for   instance. He  has an evil name in the Bree-land,  and queer folk call at his  house.  You  must  have  noticed him among the  company:  a swarthy sneering  fellow.  He  was very close with  one  of  the Southern  strangers, and they  slipped  out   together  just  after  your  \"accident\".  Not  all  of  those  Southerners mean well; and as for Ferny, he would sell anything  to anybody;  or make mischief for amusement.'       'What  will Ferny sell,  and what has my accident got to do  with him?'  said Frodo, still determined not to understand Strider's hints.        'News  of you,  of  course,'  answered  Strider.  'An  account of  your  performance would  be very interesting to certain  people.  After that  they  would hardly  need to be told your real name. It seems to me only too likely   that they will hear of it befor e this night is over. Is that enough? You can  do as you like  about my  reward: take me as a guide  or  not. But I may say  that I know all the lands  between the Shire and  the Misty Mountains, for I  have  wandered over  them for many years. I  am  older than  I look. I might   prove useful. You will  have to leave the  open  road after tonight; for the  horsemen will  watch  it  night and  day. You may  escape from  Bree, and be  allowed to  go forward while the Sun is up;  but you won't go far. They will  come on you in the wild, in some dark  place where  there is no help. Do you  wish them to find you? They are terrible!'       The  hobbits looked at him,  and  saw  with surprise that  his face was  drawn  as if with pain, and  his hands clenched the arms of  his  chair. The  room was very quiet and still, and the light seemed to have grown dim. For a  while he sat with unseeing eyes as if walking in distant memory or listening   to sounds in the Night far away.   ####-     'There!' he  cried  after  a moment, drawing his hand  across his brow.   'Perhaps I know  more about these pursuers than you  do.  You fear them, but  you do not fear them enough,  yet. Tomorrow you will  have to escape, if you  can. Strider can take  you by paths that  are  seldom trodden. Will you have  him? '       There was a heavy silence. Frodo made no answer, his mind was  confused  with doubt and fear. Sam frowned,  and looked at his  master; and at last he  broke out:       'With  your leave,  Mr. Frodo, I'd  say no! This Strider here, he warns  and he says take care; and  I say  yes to that, and let's begin with him. He  comes out  of  the Wild, and I  never heard no good  of such  folk. He knows  something, that's  plain,  and more  than  I like; but it's no reason why we  should let him go leading us out into  some dark place  far from help, as he  puts it.'       Pippin fidgeted and looked uncomfortable. Strider did not reply to Sam,  but turned his keen eyes  on Frodo. Frodo caught his glance and looked away.  'No,' he said slowly. 'I don't agree. I think, I think you are not really as  you  choose to  look. You began  to talk to me like the Bree-folk,  but your  voice has changed. Still Sam seems right in this: I don't see why you should  warn us to take care, and yet ask us to take you on trust. Why the disguise?   Who are  you? What do you really know about - about my business; and how   do  you know it?'       'The lesson in caution has been well learned,' said Strider with a grim  smile. 'But caution is one thing and wavering is another. You will never get  to Rivende ll now on your own, and to trust me is your only chance. You  must   make up your  mind. I will answer some of your  questions, if that will help  you to do so.  But  why should you believe  my story, if you do not trust me  already? Still here it is------'       At that  moment  there  came a  knock at the  door.  Mr. Butterbur  had  arrived with candles, and behind him was Nob with cans of hot water. Strider  withdrew into a dark corner."
