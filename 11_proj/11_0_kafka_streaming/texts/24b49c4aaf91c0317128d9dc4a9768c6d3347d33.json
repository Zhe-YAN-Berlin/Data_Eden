Will you not go or send to say  that  we  are come?' His eyes glinted  under his deep brows as he bent his gaze upon the man.       'Yes,  I will go,' he answered  slowly. 'But what names shall I report?   And what  shall I say of you? Old  and weary you seem now, and yet  you  are  fell and grim beneath, I deem'       'Well do you see and speak,' said the wizard. 'For I am Gandalf. I have  returned. And behold! I too bring back a horse. Here is Shadowfax the Great,  whom no other hand can tame. And here beside me  is Aragorn son of  Arathorn,  the heir of Kings, and it is to Mundburg that he goes. Here also are Legolas  the Elf and Gimli the  Dwarf, our  comrades. Go now and  say to your  master   that we are at  his gates and  would have speech with him, if he will permit  us to come into his hall.' 'Strange names you give indeed! But I will report  them as you  bid and learn my master's will,' said  the  guard. 'Wait here a   little  while, and f will bring you such answer as seems good to him. Do not   ####-hope  too much!  These are dark  days.' He  went  swiftly away,  leaving the  strangers  in the  watchful  keeping of his  comrades. After  some  time  he  returned. 'Follow me!'  he said. 'Thjoden gives you leave  to enter; but any  weapon that  you bear; be it only a  staff, you must leave on the threshold.  The doorwardens will keep them.'       The dark gates were swung open. The travellers entered, walking in file  behind their guide. They found  a broad path, paved  with hewn  stones,  now  winding  upward,  now climbing in  short  flights of well-laid  steps.  Many  houses  built of wood and many dark doors they passed.  Beside the  way in  a  stone  channel a stream of clear water flowed,  sparkling and chattering. At   length they came to the crown of the hill. There stood a high platform above  a  green terrace,  at the foot of which a bright  spring gushed from a stone  carved in the likeness of a  horse's  head;  beneath was  a  wide basin from  which the  water. spilled and fed the  falling stream. Up the  green terrace  went a stair of stone, high  and  broad, and  on either side of the  topmost   step were stone-hewn  sea,  There sat other  guards,  with drawn swords laid  upon their  knees. Their golden hair was braided on their shoulders the  sun  was blazoned upon  their green shields, their  long  corslets were burnished  bright, and when they rose taller they seemed than mortal men.       'There are the doors before you,' said the guide. 'I must return now to  my duty at the gate. Farewell! And  may the Lord  of the Mark be gracious to  you!'       He turned and went swiftly  back down  the road. The others climbed the  long stair under the eyes of the tall  watchmen. Silent they stood now above   and spoke no  word, until Gandalf stepped  out upon the paved terrace at the  stairs head. Then suddenly with clear voices they spoke a courteous greeting   in their own tongue.       Hail, corners from afar!' they said, and they turned the hilts of their  swords towards the travellers in token of  peace. Green  gems flashed in the  sunlight.  Then one of the guards stepped forward  and  spoke in  the Common  Speech.       'I am the Doorward of Thjoden,' he said. 'Hbma is my name. Here  I must   bid you lay aside your weapons before you enter.'       Then Legolas gave into his hand his silver -hafted knife, his quiver and  his bow. 'Keep these well,' he said, 'for they come from the Golden Wood and  the Lady of Lothlurien gave them to me.'       Wonder came into the man's eyes, and he laid the weapons hastily by the    ####-wall, as if he feared to handle them.  'No  man  will  touch them  I promise  you,' he said.       Aragorn stood a while hesitating. 'It is not my will,' he said,  'to put  aside my sword or to deliver And®ril to the hand of any other man.'       'It is the will of Thjoden,' said Hbma.       'It is not clear to  me that the  will of Thjoden son of  Thengel  even  though  he be lord of the  Mark, should  prevail over the will of Aragorn son   of Arathorn, Elendil's heir of Gondor.'       'This  is the house of  Thjoden, not of Aragorn, even  were  he King of  Gondor in  the seat of  Denethor,' said Hbma, stepping  swiftly  before  the  doors  and barring the  way. His sword  was now  in  his  hand and the point   towards the strangers.       'This is idle talk,' said  Gandalf. 'Needless is Thjoden's demand,  but  it is useless to refuse. A king will have his  way  in his own hall,  be  it  folly or wisdom.'       'Truly,' said Aragorn. 'And I would do as  the master of the house bade  me, were this only a woodman's cot, if I bore now any sword but And®ril.'       'Whatever its name may be,' said Hbma, 'here you shall lay it,  if  you   would not fight alone against all the men in Edoras.'       'Not alone!' said Gimli, fingering  the blade of his axe,  and  looking  darkly up at the  guard, as if he were a young tree that Gimli had a mind to  fell."
