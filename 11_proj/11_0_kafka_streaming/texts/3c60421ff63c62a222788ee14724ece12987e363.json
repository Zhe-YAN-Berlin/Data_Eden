Many of those that we pursued  had reached the havens before us, and brought their fear with them; and some  of  the ships had put off, seeking to escape down the River  or to reach  the  far shore; and many of  the  smaller  craft were  ablaze.  But the Haradrim,  being  now  driven  to the brink, turned at  bay,  and they were  fierce  in  despair; and they laughed when they looked on us, for they were a great army  still.       'But Aragorn  halted and cried with a great voice:  \"Now  come!  By the  Black Stone I call you! \" And suddenly the Shadow Host that had hung back at  the last  came up like a grey tide, sweeping all away before it. Faint cries  I heard, and  dim horns b lowing, and a murmur as of countless far voices: it   was like the echo of  some forgotten battle in the Dark Years long ago. Pale   swords were drawn; but I know not whether their blades would still bite, for   the Dead needed no longer any weapon but fear. None would withstand them.       'To every  ship they came that was drawn up, and then  they passed over   the water to those that were anchored; and all the mariners were filled with  a madness  of  terror and leaped  overboard, save the  slaves chained to the  oars. Reckless  we rode among  our fleeing foes,  driving them  like leaves,   until  we  came to  the  shore. And then to each  of  the  great  ships that  remained Aragorn sent one of the D®nedain,  and  they comforted the captives  that were aboard, and bade  them put aside fear and be free.       'Ere  that dark day ended none of the  enemy were left to resist us all  were drowned, or were flying  south in the hope to find their own lands upon  foot.  Strange and wonderful I thought it that  the designs of Mordor should  be overthrown by such wraiths of fear and darkness. With its own weapons was  it worsted!'       'Strange indeed,' said Legolas. 'In that  hour I  looked on Aragorn and   ####-thought how  great and terrible a Lord he might have become in the  strength  of his  will, had he taken the Ring to  himself.  Not for naught does Mordor   fear him. But nobler is his spirit than  the understanding of Sauron; for is  he not of  the children of  L®thien? Never shall that  line fail, though the  years may lengthen beyond count.'       'Beyond  the eyes of the Dwarves are  such  foretellings,'  said Gimli.  'But mighty indeed was  Aragorn that day. Lo! all the black fleet was in his  hands; and he chose the greatest ship to be his own, and he went up into it.  Then he  let sound a great concourse  of trumpets taken  from the enemy; and  the Shadow Host withdrew to the shore. There they stood silent, hardly to be   seen, save for a red gleam in their eyes that caught the glare of the  ships  that were  burning.  And Aragorn  spoke  in a  loud voice  to  the Dead Men,  crying:       ' \"Hear  now the words of the Heir of Isildur!  Your oath is fulfilled.  Go back and trouble not the valleys ever again! Depart and be at rest! \"       'And thereupon the King of the Dead stood out before the host and broke  his spear and cast it down. Then he bowed low and  turned away; and  swiftly  the whole grey host drew off and vanished like a mist that is driven back by   a sudden wind; and it seemed to me that I awoke from a dream.       'That  night  we  rested  while  others  laboured.  For there were many  captives set  free,  and many slaves released who  had  been folk  of Gondor   taken in raids; and  soon also  there  was  a great gathering  of men out of  Lebennin and the  Ethir, and Angbor of Lamedon came u p with all the  horsemen  that he could muster. Now that the fear of the Dead was removed they came to  aid us and to look on  the Heir of Isildur; for the  rumour of that name had  run like fire in the dark.       'And  that  is near the end  of our tale.  For  during  that evening and  night many ships were  made ready and  manned; and in the morning the  fleet  set forth. Long  past it now seems,  yet it was but the morn of  the day ere  yesterday, the  sixth  since  we rode  from Dunharrow. But still Aragorn was  driven by fear that time was too short.       '  \"It is forty leagues and  two from Pelargir to  the  landings at the  Harlond,\"  he  said.  \"Yet to  the  Harlond we must  come tomorrow  or  fail   utterly.\"       'The oars were now wielded by free men, and manfully they laboured; yet  slowly we passed up  the Great River, for  we strove against its stream, and   ####-though that is not swift down in  the South,  we had no help  of wind. Heavy  would my heart have been, for all our victory at the  havens, if Legolas had  not laughed suddenly.       ' \"Up  with your beard, Durin's son! \" he said. \"For thus is it spoken:  Oft hope is  born, when  all is forlorn.\" But what hope  he saw from afar he  would  not tell. When  night came it  did  but deepen  the darkness, and our  hearts were  hot, for away in  the North we saw a red glow under the  cloud,   and Aragorn said: \"Minas Tirith is burning."
