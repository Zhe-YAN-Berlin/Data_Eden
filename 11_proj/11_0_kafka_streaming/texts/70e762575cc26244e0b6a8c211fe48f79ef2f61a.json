'You have the  keen  eyes  of  your fair  kindred, Legolas,' he said; 'and they  can tell  a   sparrow from a finch a league off. Tell me, can you sec anything away yonder   towards Isengard?'       'Many miles  lie between,' said Legolas, gazing thither and shading his  eyes with his long hand. 'I can see a darkness. There  are shapes moving  in  it,  great shapes  far away upon the bank of the river; but  what they are I   ####-cannot tell. It  is  not  mist  or  cloud that defeats  my  eyes: there is a   veiling shadow that  some power lays upon   the  land, and  it marches slowly  down  stream.  It  is as  if the twilight under  endless trees were  flowing  downwards from the hills.'       'And behind us comes a very storm of Mordor,' said Gandalf. 'It will be  a black night.'       As  the second day  of their riding drew on, the  heaviness in the  air  increased. In the afternoon the dark clouds began to overtake them: a sombre  canopy with great billowing  edges flecked with dazzling light. The sun went  down, blood-red in a smoking haze. The spears of  the Riders were tipped with  fire as  the  last shafts of light kindled the steep  faces  of the peaks of  Thrihyrne: now very near they stood  on the  northernmost arm of  the  White  Mountains, three jagged horns staring at  the  sunset. In the last red  glow  men in the vanguard saw a black speck, a horseman  riding back towards them.  They halted awaiting him.       He came, a  weary man  with dinted helm  and cloven shield.  Slowly  he  climbed from his horse and stood there a while gasping. At  length he spoke.   'Is  Jomer  here?' he asked. 'You come at last, but too late,  and with  too  little strength. Things have gone evilly since Thjodred fell. We were driven  back yesterday over the Isen with great loss; many perished at the crossing.  Then at  night fresh   forces  came  over  the river  against  our camp.  All  Isengard  must  be  emptied;  and Saruman has  armed the  wild  hillmen  and  herd-folk of Dunland beyond the rivers, and these also he loosed upon us. We  were overmastered. The  shield-wall was  broken. Erkenbrand of  Westfold has  drawn off those men he could gather towards his fastness in Helm's Deep. The  rest are scattered.       'Where is Jomer? Tell him there is no hope ahead.  He should  return to  Edoras  before  the wolves of Isengard come there.' Thjoden  had sat silent,  hidden from  the  man's sight behind his  guards; now  he  urged  his  horse  forward. 'Come, stand before me, Ceorl!'  he said. 'I am here. The last host   of the Eorlingas has ridden forth. It will not return without battle.'       The man's face lightened with joy and wonder.  He drew himself up. Then  he knelt,  offering his  notched sword to the king. 'Command  me, lord!'  he  cried. 'And pardon me! I thought--'       'You thought I remained  in Meduseld bent like an old tree under winter   snow. So  it was  when you  rode  to war. But  a  west  wind has shaken  the   boughs,' said Thjoden. 'Give this man a fresh horse! Let us ride to the help   ####-of Erkenbrand!'       While Thjoden was speaking, Gandalf  rode a short way ahead, and he sat  there  alone, gazing north  to Isengard and west to  the setting sun. Now he  came back.       'Ride,  Thjoden!' he said. 'Ride to Helm's Deep! Go not to the Fords of  Isen, and do not tarry in the plain! I must leave you for a while. Shadowfax  must  bear me now on a swift errand.'  Turning to Aragorn and Jomer  and the  men of the king's household, he cried: 'Keep well the Lord of the Mark, till  I return. Await me at Helm's Gate! Farewell!'       He spoke a word to Shadowfax, and like an arrow  from the bow the gr eat  horse sprang away. Even as they looked he was gone: a flash of silver in the  sunset, a wind over the  grass, a shadow that fled  and  passed  from sight.  Snowmane  snorted and reared,  eager to follow; but only a swift bird on the  wing could have overtaken him.       'What does that mean?' said one of the guard to Hbma.       'That Gandalf Greyhame has need of haste,' answered Hbma. 'Ever he goes  and comes unlooked-for:'       'Wormtongue, were he here, would not find it hard to explain  'Said the  other.       'True  enough,'  said Hbma; 'but for myself, I will  wait  until I  see  Gandalf again.'       'Maybe you will wait long,' said the other.       The host turned away now from  the  road to the  Fords of Isen and bent  their course southward. Night fell,  a nd still they rode on. The hills  drew  near, but the tall peaks of Thrihyrne were already dim against the darkening  sky.  Still  some miles away, on  the far side of the Westfold  Vale,  lay a   green coomb, a great bay in  the mountains,  out of which  a gorge opened in   the hills. Men of that land called it Helm's  Deep, after a hero of old wars  who  had  made  his refuge there. Ever steeper and narrower it wound  inward  from  the  north  under the shadow  of the Thrihyrne, till the  crow-haunted  cliffs rose  like mighty towers on either side, shutting out the light."
