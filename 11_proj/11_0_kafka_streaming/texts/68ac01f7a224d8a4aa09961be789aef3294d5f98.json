Aye, and maybe a few lions. Rattleshirt, Harma the Dogshead, Alfyn Crowkiller…    I know them as well as you do, Buckwell,  Thoren Smallwood snapped back.  And I mean to have their heads, every one. These are wildlings. No soldiers. A few hundred heroes, drunk most like, amidst a great horde of women, children, and thralls. We will sweep over them and send them howling back to their hovels.   They had argued for many hours, and reached no agreement. The Old Bear was too stubborn to retreat, but neither would he rush headlong up the Milkwater, seeking battle. In the end, nothing had been decided but to wait a few more days for the men from the Shadow Tower, and talk again if they did not appear.  And now they had, which meant that the decision could be delayed no longer. Jon was glad of that much, at least. If they must battle Mance Rayder, let it be soon.  He found Dolorous Edd at the fire, complaining about how difficult it was for him to sleep when people insisted on blowing horns in the woods. Jon gave him something new to complain about. Together they woke Hake, who received the Lord Commander’s orders with a stream of curses, but got up all the same and soon had a dozen brothers cutting roots for a soup.  Sam came puffing up as Jon crossed the camp. Under the black hood his face was as pale and round as the moon.  I heard the horn. Has your uncle come back?    It’s only the men from the Shadow Tower.  It was growing harder to cling to the hope of Benjen Stark’s safe return. The cloak he had found beneath the Fist could well have belonged to his uncle or one of his men, even the Old Bear admitted as much, though why they would have buried it there, wrapped around the cache of dragonglass, no one could say.  Sam, I have to go.   At the ringwall, he found the guards sliding spikes from the half-frozen earth to make an opening. It was not long until the first of the brothers from the Shadow Tower began wending their way up the slope. All in leather and fur they were, with here and there a bit of steel or bronze; heavy beards covered hard lean faces, and made them look as shaggy as their garrons. Jon was surprised to see some of them were riding two to a horse. When he looked more closely, it was plain that many of them were wounded. There has been trouble on the way.  Jon knew Qhorin Halfhand the instant he saw him, though they had never met. The big ranger was half a legend in the Watch; a man of slow words and swift action, tall and straight as a spear, long-limbed and solemn. Unlike his men, he was clean-shaven. His hair fell from beneath his helm in a heavy braid touched with hoarfrost, and the blacks he wore were so faded they might have been greys. Only thumb and forefinger remained on the hand that held the reins; the other fingers had been sheared off catching a wildling’s axe that would otherwise have split his skull. It was told that he had thrust his maimed fist into the face of the axeman so the blood spurted into his eyes, and slew him while he was blind. Since that day, the wildlings beyond the Wall had known no foe more implacable.  Jon hailed him.  Lord Commander Mormont would see you at once. I’ll show you to his tent.   Qhorin swung down from his saddle.  My men are hungry, and our horses require tending.    They’ll all be seen to.   The ranger gave his horse into the care of one of his men and followed.  You are Jon Snow. You have your father’s look.    Did you know him, my lord?    I am no lordling. Only a brother of the Night’s Watch. I knew Lord Eddard, yes. And his father before him.   Jon had to hurry his steps to keep up with Qhorin’s long strides.  Lord Rickard died before I was born.    He was a friend to the Watch.  Qhorin glanced behind.  It is said that a direwolf runs with you.    Ghost should be back by dawn. He hunts at night.   They found Dolorous Edd frying a rasher of bacon and boiling a dozen eggs in a kettle over the Old Bear’s cookfire. Mormont sat in his wood-and-leather camp chair.  I had begun to fear for you. Did you meet with trouble?    We met with Alfyn Crowkiller. Mance had sent him to scout along the Wall, and we chanced on him returning.  Qhorin removed his helm.  Alfyn will trouble the realm no longer, but some of his company escaped us. We hunted down as many as we could, but it may be that a few will win back to the mountains.    And the cost?    Four brothers dead. A dozen wounded. A third as many as the foe. And we took captives. One died quickly from his wounds, but the other lived long enough to be questioned.    Best talk of this inside. Jon will fetch you a horn of ale. Or would you prefer hot spiced wine?    Boiled water will suffice. An egg and a bite of bacon.    As you wish.  Mormont lifted the flap of the tent and Qhorin Halfhand stooped and stepped through.  Edd stood over the kettle swishing the eggs about with a spoon."
