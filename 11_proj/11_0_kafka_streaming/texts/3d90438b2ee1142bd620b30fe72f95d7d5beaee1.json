  "text": "  For the world is changing: I  feel it in the  water, I feel it in the earth,  and I smell it in the air. I do not think we shall meet again.'       And Celeborn said: 'I do not know, Eldest.' But Galadriel sa id: 'Not in  Middle-earth, nor  until the lands  that lie  under the wave  are lifted  up  again. Then in the  willow-meads  of  Tasarinan we may meet in  the  Spring.  Farewell!'       Last of all Merry and Pippin said good-bye to the  old Ent, and he grew  gayer as he looked at  them. 'Well, my merry folk,' he said, 'will you drink   another draught with me before you go?'       'Indeed we  will,' they said,  and he took them aside into the shade of  one  of the trees, and there they saw that  a  great stone jar had been set.  And Treebeard  filled  three bowls, and they drank; and they saw his strange  eyes looking at them over the  rim of his bowl. 'Take  care take  care!'  he  said. 'For you have already grown  since I saw you last.'  And  they laughed  and drained their bowls.        'Well, good-bye!' he said. 'And don't forget  that if you hear any news  of the Entwives in your land, you  will send word to me.'  Then he waved his  great hands to all the company and went off into the trees.          The  travellers now  rode with more  speed,  and  they made  their  way  towards  the Gap of Rohan; and Aragorn took leave  of them at last  close to  that  very place where  Pippin had looked  into  the Stone  of  Orthanc. The   ####-Hobbits were grieved at this parting; for Aragorn had never failed  them and  he had been their guide through many perils.        'I wish  we  could have a Stone that  we could see all our friends in,'  said Pippin, 'and that we could speak to them from far away!'       'Only  one  now remains  that you could use ,'  answered Aragorn for you   would not wish to see what the Stone of Minas Tirith would show you. But the  Palantnr of Orthanc the King will keep, to see what is passing in his realm,  and what his servants are doing. For do not forget, Peregrin Took, that  you   are a knight  of Gondor, and I do not release you from your service. You are  going now on leave, but I may recall you.  And remember, dear friends of the  Shire, that my realm  lies  also in the  North, and I shall  come there  one  day.'       Then Aragorn took leave of Celeborn and Galadriel; and the Lady said to  him: 'Elfstone,  through  darkness  you have come to your hope, and have now  all your desire. Use well the days!'       But  Celeborn  said: 'Kinsman,  farewell! May  your doom be  other than  mine, and your treasure remain with you to the end!'       With that they parted,  and  it was then the  time  of sunset; and when  after  a  while  they turned and looked back,  they saw the King of the West  sitting upon his horse with his knights about him; and the falling Sun shone  upon them and made all  their harness to gleam like red gold,  and the white  mantle of Aragorn  was turned  to a flame. Then Aragorn took the green stone  and held it up, and there came a green fire from his hand.       Soon the dwindling company, following the  Isen,  turned west  and rode  through  the  Gap  into  the  waste  lands  beyond,  and  then  they  turned  northwards, and passed over the borders of Dunland. The Dunlendings fled and  hid themselves, for they were afraid of Elv ish Folk,  though few indeed ever   came to  their country; but the travellers  did not heed them, for they were  still a great company and were well provided  with all that they needed; and   they went  on  their way at their leisure, setting  up their tents when they  would.       On the  sixth day  since their  parting  from the  King  they journeyed  through  a wood  climbing  down from the  hills  at the  feet  of the  Misty  Mountains that now marched on their right hand. As they came out  again into  the open country at sundown they overtook an old man leaning on a staff, and  he was clothed in rags of grey or dirty white, and at his heels went another   beggar, slouching and whining.   ####-     'Well Saruman!' said Gandalf. 'Where are you going?'       'What is  that to  you?' he answered. 'Will you  still  order my goings,   and are you not content with my ruin?'       'You know the  answers,' said Gandalf: 'no and no. But in  any case the  time of my labours now draws to an end. The King has taken on the burden. If  you had waited at Orthanc, you would have seen  him, and he would have  shown  you wisdom and mercy.'       'Then all the A more reason  to have left sooner,' said Saruman; 'for I  desire  neither  of  him.  Indeed if  you wish for  an answer  to your first  question, I am seeking a way out of his realm.'       'Then once  more you are going the wrong way,' said Gandalf, 'and I see  no hope in your journey.  But  will  you scorn our help?  For we offer it to  you.'       'To  me?' said  Saruman. 'Nay, pray do not smile  at me! I prefer  your  frowns. And as  for the Lady here, I do not trust her:  she always hated me,  and schemed  for your part."
