Long  ere day the masted ships  hoisted sail; and our speed grew, until dawn  whitened the foam at our prows. And so it was, as  you know, that we came in  the third  hour of the morning with a fair wind and the Sun unveiled, and we  unfurled the great standard in battle. It was a great  day and a great hour,  whatever may come after.'       'Follow what may, great deeds are not lessened in worth,' said Legolas.   'Great  deed was the riding of  the Paths  of the Dead, and great  it  shall  remain, though none be left  in Gondor to sing of it in the days that are to  come.'       'And  that may well befall,' said Gimli.  'For the faces of Aragorn and  Gandalf are grave. Much I  wonder what counsels they are taking in the tents  there below. For my part, like Merry, I wish that with our victory  the  war  was now over.  Yet whatever is still to do, I hope to have a part in it, for   the honour of the folk of the Lonely Mountain.'       'And I for the folk of the Great Wood,' said Legolas, 'and for the love  of the Lord of the White Tree.'       Then the companions fell silent, but a while they sat there in the high  place, each busy with his own thoughts, while the Captains debated.       When the Prince Imrahil had parted  from Legolas and Gimli, at once  he  sent  for Jomer; and he went down with him  from the  City, and they came to  the tents  of Aragorn that were set up on the field not  far  from the place  where King Thjoden had  fallen.  And there they took  counsel together  with  Gandalf and Aragorn and the sons of Elrond.       'My lords,' said Gandalf, 'listen to the words of the Steward of Gondor   before he died: You may triumph on the fields of the Pelennor for a day, but  against the Power that has  now arisen there is no victory. I do not bid you   despair, as he did, but to ponder the truth in these words.   ####-     'The  Stones of Seeing do  not lie, and not even  the Lord of Barad-dyr  can make  them do so. He can, maybe, by his will choose what things shall be  seen by weaker minds, or cause them to mistake the meaning of what they see.  Nonetheless it cannot be doubted that when Denethor saw great forces arrayed  against him  in Mordor,  and more  still being gathered, he  saw  that which  truly is.       'Hardly has our strength sufficed to beat off the first  grea t assault.  The next will be greater.  This war  then is without final hope, as Denethor   perceived. Victory  cannot be  achieved by  arms, whether  you sit  here  to  endure siege after siege, or  march  out to be overwhelmed beyond the River.  You  have  only a  choice  of  evils;  and prudence  would  counsel  you  to  strengthen such strong places as you have, and there await the onset; for so  shall the time before your end be made a little longer.'       'Then you would have  us retreat to Minas Tirith, or Dol  Amroth, or to  Dunharrow, and  there sit  like children on  sand-castles when  the tide  is  flowing?' said Imrahil.       'That would  be no new  counsel,' said Gandalf. 'Have you not done this  and  little more in all the  days of Denethor?  But no! I sa id this would be  prudent. I do not counsel prudence. I said  victory could not be achieved by  arms. I still hope for victory, but not by arms.  For into the midst  of all  these policies comes the Ring of Power, the foundation of Barad-dyr, and the  hope of Sauron.       'Concerning  this  thing,  my  lords, you now  all know enough for  the  understanding of our plight, and of  Sauron's. If he regains it, your valour  is  vain, and his victory will be swift and complete: so  complete that none  can foresee the  end of it while this world lasts. If it is destroyed,  then  he will fall; and his  fall will be so low that none can foresee his arising  ever again. For he will lose the best part of the  strength  that was native  to him in his beginning, and all that was made or begun with that power will   crumble, and he will  be maimed  for ever, becoming a mere  spirit of malice  that  gnaws itself in the shadows, but cannot again grow  or take shape. And  so a great evil of this world will be removed.       'Other evils there are  that may come;  for  Sauron  is  himself  but a   servant or emissary.  Yet it is  not our part to master all the tides of the  world, but to do what is in us for the succour of those years wherein we are  set, uprooting the  evil in the fields that we know, so  that those who live  after may have clean earth to till. What weather they shall have is not ours   ####-to rule.       'Now Sauron knows all this, and he knows that this precious thing which  he lost has been found again; but he does not yet know where it is, or so we  hope. And therefore he is now  in great doubt. For  if we  have  found  this  thing, there are some among us with strength enough to wield it. That too he  knows."
