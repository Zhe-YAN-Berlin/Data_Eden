Then Faramir came and sought her, and once more they stood on the walls  together; and he said to  her: 'Jowyn, why  do you tarry here, and do not go  to the rejoicing in  Cormallen beyond Cair Andros, where your brother awaits  you?'       And she said: 'Do you not know?'       But he answered: 'Two reasons there may be, but which is true, l do not  know.'       And she said: 'I do not wish to play at riddles. Speak plainer!'       'Then if you  will have it so, lady,' he  said: 'you do  not go, because  only your brother called for you, and to look on the Lord Aragorn, Elendil's   ####-heir, in his triumph would now bring you no joy. Or because I do not go, and  you  desire still to be near me. And maybe for both  these reasons,  and you   yourself cannot choose between them. Jowyn, do  you not love me, or will you   not?'       'I wished to be loved by another,' she answered. 'But I desire no man's  pity.'       'That I know,' he  said. 'You  desired  to  have  the love  of the Lord  Aragorn. Because he was high and puissant, and you wished to have renown  and  glory and to be  lifted far above the  mean things that crawl on  the earth.  And as a great captain may to a young soldier  he seemed  to you  admirable.  For so he is, a lord among men,  the greatest that  now is. But when he gave   you only  understanding and pity, then you desired to have nothing, unless a   brave death in battle. Look at me, Jowyn!'       And Jowyn  looked at Faramir long and  steadily; and Faramir  said: 'Do  not scorn pity that is the gift of a gentle heart, Jowyn! But I do not offer   you my pity. For  you  are  a lady high  and valiant  and  have yourself won  renown that shall not be forgotten; and you  are  a lady  beautiful, I deem,  beyond even the words of  the Elven-tongue  to tell. And I love  you. Once I   pitied your sorrow. But now, were you sorrowless, without fear  or any lack,  were you the blissful Queen of Gondor, still I would love you. Jowyn, do you  not love me?'       Then the heart of Jowyn changed, or else at last she understood it. And  suddenly her winter passed, and the sun shone on her.       I stand in Minas Anor, the Tower of the Sun,  she  said; and behold the  Shadow has departed! I  will be a shieldmaiden no longer, nor  vie  with the   great Riders, nor take joy only in the songs of slaying. I will be a healer,  and love all things that  grow and are not barren.' And again  she looked at  Faramir. 'No longer do I desire to be a queen,' she said.       Then Faramir laughed merrily.  'That is well,' he said; 'for I am not  a   king. Yet I will wed with the White Lady of Rohan, if it be her will. And if  she  will, then let us cross  the  River and in happier days let us dwell in  fair Ithilien  and there make a garden. All things will grow with joy there,  if the White Lady comes.'       'Then must I leave my own people, man of Gondor?' she said. 'And  would  you have  your proud  folk say of you: (There  goes a  lord who tamed a wild  shieldmaiden  of the North! Was  there  no woman of the race  of NÂ®menor  to   ####-choose?('       'I  would,'  said  Faramir. And he took her in his arms and  kissed her   under  the  sunlit sky, and he cared not that they stood high upon the walls  in  the  sight  of many. And many indeed saw  them  and the light that shone  about them as they came down from  the  walls  and went hand in hand  to the  Houses of Healing.       And to the Warden of  the Houses Faramir said:  'Here is the Lady Jowyn  of Rohan, and now she is healed.'       And the  Warden  said: 'Then I release her from  my charge and bid  her   farewell, and may she suffer never hurt nor sickness again. I commend her to  the care of the Steward of the City, until her brother returns.'       But Jowyn said:  'Yet  now that I have leave to depart, I would remain.  For this House has become to me of all dwellings  the most blessed.' And she  remained there until King Jomer came.       All things  were  now  made  ready  in  the City; and there  was  great  concourse of  people, for the tidings had gone out into all parts of Gondor,  from Min-Rimmon even to Pinnath Gelin and the far coasts of the sea; and all  that could  come to the  City made haste  to come.  And the City  was filled  again with women  and fair children  that returned to their homes laden with  flowers;  and from Dol Amroth came the harpers that harped most skilfully in  all the land; and there  were players upon viols and  upon  flutes and  upon  horns of silver, and clear-voiced singers from the vales of Lebennin.       At last an evening came when from the walls the pavilions could be seen  upon  the field, and all night lights were  burning as men  watched for  the  dawn. And when the sun rose in  the clear morning above the mountains in the  East, upon which shadows lay no more, then  all  the bells rang, and all the  banners  broke  and  flowed in the wind;  and upon  the White  Tower  of the   citadel the standard of  the Stewards,  bright argent like snow  in the sun,  bearing no charge nor device, was raised over Gondor for the last time."
