Appendix  Other Houses Great And Small      HOUSE ARRYN   The Arryns are descended from the Kings of Mountain and Vale, one of the oldest and purest lines of Andal nobility. House Arryn has taken no part in the War of the Five Kings, holding back its strength to protect the Vale of Arryn. The Arryn sigil is the moon-and-falcon, white, upon a sky-blue field. The Arryn words are As High As Honor.      ROBERT ARRYN, Lord of the Eyrie, Defender of the Vale, Warden of the East, a sickly boy of eight years, —his mother, LADY LYSA, of House Tully, third wife and widow of Lord Jon Arryn, and sister to Catelyn Stark,  —their household: —MARILLION, a handsome young singer, much favored by Lady Lysa,  —MAESTER COLEMON, counselor, healer, and tutor,  —SER MARWYN BELMORE, captain of guards,  —MORD, a brutal gaoler,      —his lords bannermen, knights, and retainers: —LORD NESTOR ROYCE, High Steward of the Vale and castellan of the Gates of the Moon, of the junior branch of House Royce, —Lord Nestor’s son, SER ALBAR,  —Lord Nestor’s daughter, MYRANDA,  —MYA STONE, a bastard girl in his service, natural daughter of King Robert I Baratheon,  —LORD YOHN ROYCE, called BRONZE YOHN, Lord of Runestone, of the senior branch of House Royce, cousin to Lord Nestor, —Lord Yohn’s eldest son, SER ANDAR,  —Lord Yohn’s second son, {SER ROBAR}, a knight of Renly Baratheon’s Rainbow Guard, slain at Storm’s End by Ser Loras Tyrell,  —Lord Yohn’s youngest son, {SER WAYMAR}, a man of the Night’s Watch, lost beyond the Wall,  —SER LYN CORBRAY, a suitor to Lady Lysa, —MYCHEL REDFORT, his squire,  —LADY ANYA WAYNWOOD, —Lady Anya’s eldest son and heir, SER MORTON, a suitor to Lady Lysa,  —Lady Anya’s second son, SER DONNEL, the Knight of the Gate,  —EON HUNTER, Lord of Longbow Hall, an old man, and a suitor to Lady Lysa,  —HORTON REDFORT, Lord of Redfort.      HOUSE FLORENT   The Florents of Brightwater Keep are Tyrell bannermen, despite a superior claim to Highgarden by virtue of a blood tie to House Gardener, the old Kings of the Reach. At the outbreak of the War of the Five Kings, Lord Alester Florent followed the Tyrells in declaring for King Renly, but his brother Ser Axell chose King Stannis, whom he had served for years as castellan of Dragonstone. Their niece Selyse was and is King Stannis’s queen. When Renly died at Storm’s End, the Florents went over to Stannis with all their strength, the first of Renly’s bannermen to do so. The sigil of House Florent shows a fox head in a circle of flowers.      ALESTER FLORENT, Lord of Brightwater, —his wife, LADY MELARA, of House Crane,  —their children: —ALEKYNE, heir to Brightwater,  —MELESSA, wed to Lord Randyll Tarly,  —RHEA, wed to Lord Leyton Hightower,  —his siblings: —SER AXELL, castellan of Dragonstone,  —{SER RYAM}, died in a fall from a horse, —Ser Ryam’s daughter, QUEEN SELYSE, wed to King Stannis Baratheon,  —Ser Ryam’s son, {SER IMRY}, commanding Stannis Baratheon’s fleet on the Blackwater, lost with the Fury,  —Ser Ryam’s second son, SER ERREN, held captive at Highgarden,  —SER COLIN, —Ser Colin’s daughter, DELENA, wed to SER HOSMAN NORCROSS, —Delena’s son, EDRIC STORM, a bastard of King Robert I Baratheon, twelve years of age,  —Delena’s son, ALESTIR NORCROSS, eight,  —Delena’s son, RENLY NORCROSS, a boy of two,  —Ser Colin’s son, MAESTER OMER, in service at Old Oak,  —Ser Colin’s son, MERRELL, a squire on the Arbor,  —his sister, RYLENE, wed to Ser Rycherd Crane."
