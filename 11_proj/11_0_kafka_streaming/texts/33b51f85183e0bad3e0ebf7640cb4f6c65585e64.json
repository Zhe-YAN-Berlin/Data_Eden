  "text": " I now repeat  it more correctly: Thank  you  very  much for coming  to my little party. Obstinate  silence. They all   feared that  a song or some poetry was now imminent;  and they  were getting  bored. Why couldn't he stop talking and let them drink his health? But Bilbo   did not sing or recite. He paused for a moment.       Thirdly  and finally, he said,  I wish to make an ANNOUNCEMENT. He  spoke  this last word so  loudly and suddenly that everyone sat up who still could.  I regret to announce that - though, as I said, eleventy -one years is far too  short a time to spend among you - this is the END. I am going. I  am leaving  NOW. GOOD-BYE!       He stepped down and  vanished. There was a blinding flash of light, and  the guests  all blinked. When they opened their eyes Bilbo was nowhere to be  seen. One hundred  and forty-four flabbergasted hobbits sat back speechless.    ####-Old  Odo Proudfoot  removed his feet from the table and stamped. Then  there  was  a  dead  silence,  until  suddenly, after  several deep breaths,  every  Baggins,  Boffin,   Took,   Brandybuck,   Grubb,  Chubb,  Burrows,   Bolger,  Bracegirdle,  Brockhouse, Goodbody, Hornblower, and  Proudfoot began to  talk   at once.       It  was generally agreed that the joke was  in very bad taste, and more  food and drink were needed to cure the guests  of shock and annoyance. 'He's  mad. I always said so,'  was probably  the  most  popular comment.  Even the  Tooks (with a few exceptions) thought  Bilbo's behaviour was absurd. For the  moment most of  them took it for granted that his disappearance was  nothing  more than a ridiculous prank.       But old Rory Brandybuck was not  so sure. Neither age  nor an  enormous  dinner  had clouded his wits, and he said to his daughter -in-law, Esmeralda:  'There's something fishy in this, my dear! I believe that mad Baggins is off  again. Silly old fool. But why worry? He hasn't taken the vittles with him.'  He called loudly to Frodo to send the wine round again.       Frodo  was the only one present who had said nothing. For some time  he  had  sat silent  beside  Bilbo's  empty  chair,  and ignored all remarks and  questions. He had enjoyed the  joke,  of course, even  though he had been in  the  know. He had  difficulty  in  keeping  from  laughter at the  indignant  surprise of  the guests.  But  at the  same time he felt deeply troubled: he  realized  suddenly  that he loved the old hobbit  dearly. Most of the guests  went on eating and drinking and discussing Bilbo Baggins' oddities, past and  present;  but the Sackville-Bagginses had already  departed in wrath.  Frodo  did not want to have any more  to do with the party. He gave orders for more  wine to be served; then he got up and drained his own glass  silently to the  health of Bilbo, and slipped out of the pavilion.       As for Bilbo Baggins,  even while he was making his speech, he had been  fingering the golden ring   in his pocket:  his magic ring that he  had  kept  secret for so many years. As he  stepped  down he slipped it on his  finger,  and he was never seen by any hobbit in Hobbiton again.       He walked  briskly back to his hole, and stood  for a moment  listening  with a smile to the din in  the pavilion and to the sounds of merrymaking in  other parts  of the field. Then he  went in.  He took off his party clothes,   folded up and wrapped  in tissue-paper his  embroidered  silk waistcoat, and  put it away. Then he put on quickly  some old untidy  garments, and fastened   ####-round his  waist a  worn leather  belt.  On it  he  hung a short sword in  a   battered  black-leather  scabbard.  From  a  locked  drawer,   smelling   of  moth-balls, he took out an old cloak and hood . They had been locked up as if  they were very precious, but they were  so  patched and weatherstained  that  their  original  colour  could hardly be guessed: it might  have  been  dark  green. They were rather too large for him. He then  went into his study, and  from  a  large  strong-box  took out a bundle  wrapped in  old cloths, and a   leather -bound  manuscript; and  also a large bulky  envelope.  The  book and   bundle  he stuffed  into  the top  of a heavy  bag  that was standing there,  already nearly full.  Into the envelope he slipped his  golden ring, and its  fine chain, and then  sealed it, and addressed it  to Frodo. At first he put  it  on the mantelpiece,  but  suddenly  he  removed it and  stuck  it in his  pocket. At that moment the door opened and Gandalf came quickly in.       'Hullo!' said Bilbo. 'I wondered if you would turn up.'       'I am glad to find you visible,' replied the wizard, sitting down  in a   chair, 'I wanted to catch you and have a few final words. I suppose you feel  that everything has gone off splendidly and according to plan?'       'Yes,  I do,' said  Bilbo. \"Though that flash was surprising: it  quite  startled  me,  let alone the  others. A  little  addition  of  your  own,  I  suppose?'       It was."
