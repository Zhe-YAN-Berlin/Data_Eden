It is something to have started.'       Treebeard marched on, singing with the others for a  while.  But after a   time his voice died to a murmur and fell silent again. Pippin could see that  his old  brow was wrinkled and  knotted.  At  last he  looked up, and Pippin  could see a sad look in his eyes,  sad but not unhappy. There was a light in  them, as if   the green  flame had  sunk deeper into the  dark  wells of  his  thought.       'Of course, it  is likely  enough, my friends,' he said slowly, 'likely  enough that we are going to  our doom: the last march of the Ents. But if we  stayed at home  and did noth ing, doom would find us anyway, sooner or later.  That thought has long been  growing in our hearts;  and that is  why we  are  marching now. It was not a hasty resolve. Now at least the last march of the  Ents may  be worth a song.  Aye,'  he sighed, 'we may help the other peoples  before we pass away. Still, I should have liked to see the  songs come  true  about the Entwives. I should dearly have liked to  see Fimbrethil again. But  there, my friends, songs  like trees bear fruit  only  in their own time and  their own way: and sometimes they are withered untimely.'       The Ents  went  striding  on at a great pace. They had descended into a   long fold of the land that fell away southward;  now they began to climb up,   and up, on to the high western  ridge. The woods fell  away and they came to  scattered groups of birch, and  then  to bare slopes where only  a few gaunt  pine-trees grew. The sun  sank behind the dark hill -back in front. Grey dusk   fell.   ####-     Pippin looked behind. The number of  the Ents had grown -- or  what was  happening? Where  the dim bare  slopes that  they had crossed should lie, he  thought he saw groves of trees. But they were  moving! Could it be  that the  trees of  Fangorn  were awake, and the  forest was rising, marching over the  hills to war? He rubbed his  eyes wondering if sleep and shadow had deceived  him; but the great grey shapes moved steadily onward. There was a noise like  wind  in many branches. The Ents were  drawing  near the  crest of the ridge  now, and all song had ceased. Night fell, and there was silence: nothing was  to be  heard save a faint quiver of the earth beneath the  feet of the Ents,   and a rustle, the shade of a whisper as of  many  drifting  leaves. At  last   they stood upon the summit, and looked down into a dark pit: the great cleft   at the end of the mountains: Nan Curunnr, the Valley of Saruman.       'Night lies over Isengard,' said Treebeard.     ####-   Chapter 5. The White Rider            'My very bones are chilled,' said Gimli, flapping his arms and stamping  his  feet.  Day  had  come at last.  At dawn  the companions  had made  such  breakfast as they could; now in the growing light they were getting ready to   search the ground again for signs of the hobbits.       'And do not forget that old man!' said Gimli. 'I should be happier if I  could see the print of a boot.'       'Why would that make you happy?' said Legolas.        'Because an old man with feet that leave marks might be no more than he  seemed,' answered the Dwarf.        'Maybe,' said the Elf; 'but a heavy boot might leave no print here: the  grass is deep and springy.'       'That would not  baffle a Ranger,' said Gimli.  'A bent blade is enough  for Aragorn to read.  But I do not expect  him to find any traces. It was an  evil phantom of Saruman that we saw last night.  I am sure of it, even under   the light of morning. His eyes are looking out on us from Fangorn even  now,   maybe.'       'It is likely enough,' said  Aragorn; 'yet I am not sure. I am thinking  of the horses. You said last night, Gimli, that they were scared away. Bu t I  did not think so. Did  you hear  them, Legolas? Did they  sound to you  like  beasts in terror?'       'No,' said Legolas. 'I heard them clearly. But for the darkness and our  own  fear I should have guessed that they  were beasts wild with some sudden  gladness.  They spoke as horses will when they meet a friend  that they have  long missed.'       'So I thought,'  said  Aragorn; 'but I  cannot  read the riddle, unless  they return. Come! The  light  is growing fast. Let  us look first and guess  later! We should  begin here,  near  to  our own  camping-ground,  searching   carefully all about, and working  up  the slope  towards the forest. To find  the  hobbits is  our  errand, whatever we may think of  our  visitor in  the  night. If  they  escaped by some chance,  then they  must have hidden in the  trees, or they would have been seen. If we find nothing between here and the  eaves of the wood, then we will make a last search upon the battle-field and   among the ashes. But there  is little hope there:  the horsemen  of Rohan did   ####-their work too well."
