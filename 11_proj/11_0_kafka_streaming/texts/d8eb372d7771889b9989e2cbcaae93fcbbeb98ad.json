Their great grey trunks were of mighty girth, but  their height could not be guessed.       `I will climb up,' said  Legolas. `I am at home among trees, by root or   bough, though  these  trees are of a kind strange to  me, save as  a name in   ####-song.  Mellyrn  they are called, and are those that bear the yellow blossom,  but I have never climbed in one. I will see now what is  their shape and way  of growth.'       `Whatever  it may be,'  said Pippin,  `they  will be  marvellous  trees  indeed if they can offer any rest at night, except to birds. I cannot  sleep  on a perch! '       'Then dig a hole in the  ground,' said Legolas, `if that  is more after  the fashion of your kind. But  you  must dig swift and deep, if you  wish to  hide from Orcs.' He sprang  lightly up from the ground  and  caught a branch  that grew from the trunk high above his head. But even as he swung there for  a moment, a voice spoke suddenly from the tree-shadows above him.       `Daro!'  it said in commanding tone, and Legolas dropped back to  earth  in surprise and fear. He shrank against the bole of the tree.       'Stand still! ' he whispered to the others. `Do not move or speak! '       There  was a sound  of soft laughter over their heads, and then another   clear voice spoke in an  elven-tongue. Frodo could understand little of what  was  said, for the speech that the  Silvan folk east of the  mountains  used  among themselves was unlike that of the West. Legolas looked up and  answered  in the same language.*       `Who are they, and what do they say? ' asked Merry.       `They're Elves,' said Sam. `Can't  you hear their voices? '       `Yes, they are Elves,'  said Legolas; `and they say that you breathe so  loud that they could  shoot you in the dark.' Sam  hastily put his hand over  his mouth.  'But they say also that  you need have  no fear. They have  been  aware of us for a long while. They heard  my  voice across the Nimrodel, and  knew that I  was one of their  Northern kindred, and therefore they did  not  hinder our  crossing; and  afterwards  they  heard  my song. Now they bid me  climb up  with Frodo;  for they seem  to have had some tidings of him and of  our journey. The others they ask to wait a little and to keep  watch at  the  foot of the tree, until they have decided what is to be done.'       Out of  the  shadows a  ladder  was  let  down:  it  was made  of rope,  silver -grey and  glimmering  in the dark, and  though it looked  slender  it  proved  strong enough to bear  many men. Legolas ran  lightly up, and  Frodo  followed slowly; behind  came Sam trying not to breathe loudly. The branches  of the mallorn-tree grew  out nearly straight from the trunk, and then swept  upward; but near the top the main stem divided into a crown  of many boughs,    ####-and  among these they  found that there had been built a wooden platform, or  flet as such things were called in those days: the  Elves called it a talan.  It  was  reached  by a round hole in  the  centre  through  which the ladder   passed.       When Frodo came at last up on to the flet he found Legolas seated  with  three other Elves. They were clad  in  shadowy-grey, and could  not  be seen  among  the tree-stems, unless they moved suddenly. They stood up, and one of  them uncovered a small lamp that  gave out a slender silver beam. He held it  up,  looking at Frodo's face,  and Sam's. Then he shut  off the light again,  and  spoke words of welcome in  his elven-tongue.  Frodo  spoke haltingly in  return.       `Welcome!' the Elf then said  again in the  Common  Language,  speaking  slowly. 'We seldom use any tongue but our own; for we dwell now in the heart  of the forest, and do not willingly have dealings  with any other folk. Even  our own kindred in the North are sundered from us. But there  are some of us  still  who  go  abroad  for  the gathering  of news and the watching  of our  enemies, and they speak the languages of other lands. I am one. Haldir is my   name. My brothers, RÂ®mil and Orophin, speak little of your tongue.       `But we have heard rumours of your coming, for the messengers of Elrond  passed by Lurien on their way home up the Dimrill Stair. We had not heard of  hobbits, or halflings, for many a long year,  and did not know  that any yet  dwelt in Middle-earth. You do not  look evil! And since you come with an Elf  of our  kindred, we are willing to befriend you, as  Elrond asked; though it  is not our custom to lead strangers through our land. But you must stay here  tonight. How many are you? '       `Eight,' said Legolas. `Myself, four hobbits; and two men, one of whom,  Aragorn, is an Elf-friend of the folk of Westernesse.'       `The  name of Aragorn son of Arathorn is known in Lurien,' said Haldir,  `and  he  has the favour of  the  Lady. All then is  well.  But you have yet  spoken only of seven.'       `The eighth is a dwarf,' said Legolas."
