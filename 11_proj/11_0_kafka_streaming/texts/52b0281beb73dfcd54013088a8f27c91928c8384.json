But Celebrimbor was  aware of him, and  hid the  Three which  he had made; and there was war, and  the land was laid waste, and the gate of Moria was shut.   ####-     Then through all the years that followed he  traced the Ring; but since  that history is elsewhere recounted, even as Elrond  himself  set it down in  his books of lore,  it is not   here recalled. For it is a long tale, full of  deeds great and terrible, and briefly though Elrond spoke,  the sun rode  up  the sky, and the morning was passing ere he ceased.       Of N®menor he spoke, its glory  and its fall,  and the  return  of  the  Kings of Men to Middle-earth out  of the  deeps of  the Sea, borne  upon the  wings  of storm.  Then Elendil the  Tall and  his  mighty sons,  Isildur and  Anbrion, became great lords; and the North-realm they made in Arnor, and the  South-realm  in  Gondor above  the mouths  of  Anduin. But Sauron of  Mordor   assailed them, and they made the Last Alliance of  Elves  and  Men,  and the  hosts of Gil-galad and Elendil were mustered in Arnor.       Thereupon  Elrond paused a  while  and  sighed.  `I  remember  well the  splendour  of  their banners,' he said.  `It recalled to me the glory of the  Elder  Days  and the hosts of Beleriand, so many great princes and  captains  were  assembled. And yet not so many, nor so fair, as when Thangorodrim  was  broken, and the  Elves deemed that evil was ended for ever,  and it was  not  so.'       `You  remember?'  said  Frodo,   speaking  his  thought  aloud  in  his  astonishment. `But I thought,' he stammered as Elrond turned towards him, 'I  thought that the fall of Gil-galad was a long age ago.'       'So  it was  indeed,' answered  Elrond gravely.  `But my memory reaches  back even  to the Elder Days. Edrendil was my sire, who was born in Gondolin  before its fall; and my mother was Elwing, daughter  of Dior, son of L®thien  of  Doriath .  I  have  seen  three ages in the West of the world,  and  many  defeats, and many fruitless victories.        `I  was the herald of Gil-galad and marched with his host. I was at the  Battle  of  Dagorlad before  the  Black Gate of  Mordor,  where  we had  the  mastery: for the Spear  of  Gil-galad and the  Sword of Elendil, Aiglos  and  Narsil, none could  withstand.  I beheld the  last  combat  on the slopes of  Orodruin, where Gil-galad  died, and  Elendil fell, and Narsil broke beneath   him; but Sauron himself  was overthrown, and Isildur  cut the Ring  from his  hand with the hilt-shard of his father's sword, and took it for his own.'       At this the stranger, Boromir, broke in. `So that is what became of the  Ring!' he  cried. `If ever  such a  tale was told  in the South, it  has long  been forgotten. I have  heard of  the Great Ring of him that we do not name;   but we believed  that it  perished from the world in the  ruin of  his first    ####-realm. Isildur took it! That is tidings indeed.'       `Alas! yes,' said Elrond. `Isildur took it, as should not have been. It  should have  been cast then into Orodruin's fire nigh  at hand  where it was  made. But few marked what Isildur did.  He alone stood by his father in that  last mortal  contest; and by Gil-galad only Cnrdan stood, and I. But Isildur  would not listen to our counsel.       '  \"This  I will have as weregild for  my father, and my  brother,\"  he  said; and  therefore whether we would or no, he took  it to treasure it. But  soon he was betrayed by  it  to  his death; and so  it is named in the North  Isildur's Bane. Yet death  maybe  was  better  than  what  else  might  have  befallen him.       'Only to the North did  these tidings come, and  only  to a few.  Small  wonder  it is that you have not heard them,  Boromir. From the  ruin  of the  Gladden Fields,  where Isildur perished, three men only came ever back  over  the mountains  after long wandering. One of these was  Ohtar, the esquire of  Isildur, who bore the shards of the sword of Elendil; and he brought them to  Valandil, the heir of Isildur, who being  but a  child had remained  here in  Rivendell.  But Narsil was broken and its light extinguished, and it has not  yet been forged again.       `Fruitless did I call the victory of the Last  Alliance? Not wholly so,  yet it  did not achieve  its  end. Sauron was diminished, but not destroyed.  His  Ring was  lost  but  not  unmade. The Dark  Tower  was broken,  but its  foundations were not removed; for they were made with the power of the Ring,  and while it remains  they wi ll endure. Many Elves and many mighty Men,   and  many  of  their  friends. had perished  in  the war. Anbrion  was slain, and  Isildur was slain; and Gil-galad and Elendil were no more. Never again shall   there  be  any  such  league  of  Elves  and  Men; for  Men  multiply and the  Firstborn decrease, and the two  kindreds are estranged."
