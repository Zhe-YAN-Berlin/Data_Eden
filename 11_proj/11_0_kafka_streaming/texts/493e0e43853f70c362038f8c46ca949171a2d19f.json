'It is good to learn that they are still alive,' said Gimli;  'for they  cost us great pains in our march over Rohan, and I would not have such pains  all wasted.'       Together the  Elf and the Dwarf entered Minas Tirith, and folk that saw  them  pass  marvelled to see such companions; for Legolas was fair  of  face  beyond the measure of Men, and  he sang an elven-song in a clear voice as he  walked in the morning; but Gimli stalked  beside him, stroking his beard and  staring about him.       'There is  some  good  stone-work here,'  he said as he  looked  a t the  walls;  'but also  some that is  less good, and  the streets could be better   contrived. When Aragorn comes into his own, I shall offer him the service of  stonewrights of the Mountain, and we will make this a town to be proud of.'       'They need more gardens,' said Legolas. 'The houses are dead, and there  is too little  here that grows and is glad.  If Aragorn comes into his  own,  the people of the Wood shall bring him birds that sing and trees that do not  die.'       At  length they came to the Prince  Imrahil, and  Legolas  looked at him  and bowed  low; for he  saw that here  indeed was one who had elven-blood in  his veins. 'Hail, lord!' he said.  'It is long since the people  of Nimrodel  left the woodlands of Lurien, and yet still one may see that  no t all sailed  from Amroth's haven west over water.'       'So it is said in the lore of my land,' said the Prince; 'yet never has  one of the fair folk been seen there for years beyond count. And I marvel to  see one here now in the midst of sorrow and war. What do you seek?'       'I  am  one of the Nine  Companions  who  set  out with Mithrandir from  Imladris, said Legolas and with  this Dwarf, my friend, I came with the Lord  Aragorn. But now we wish to see  our friends. Meriadoc and Peregrin, who are  in your keeping, we are told.'       'You  will  find them  in  the Houses of Healing, and  I will  lead you    ####-thither,' said Imrahil.       'It will be  enough if you send one to guide  us,  lord,' said Legolas.   'For Aragorn sends this message to you. He does not wish  to  enter the City  again at this  time. Yet there is need  for the captains to hold  council at  once, and he prays that you and Jomer of  Rohan will come down to his tents,   as soon as may be. Mithrandir is already there.'       'We will come,' said Imrahil; and they parted with courteous words.       'That  is  a  fair lord and a great captain of men,'  said Legolas. 'If  Gondor has such men still in these  days of fading, great must have been its  glory in the days of its rising.'       'And doubtless the good stone-work is the older and  was wrought in the  first building,' said  Gimli. 'It is ever so with the things that Men begin:  there  is a frost  in Spring, or a blight in Summer, and they  fail of their  promise.'       'Yet seldom do they fail of their seed,' said  Legolas. 'And that  will  lie in the dust and rot to spring up again in times and places unlooked-for.  The deeds of Men will outlast us, Gimli.'       'And yet come to naught in the end but might-have-beens, I guess,' said  the Dwarf.       'To that the Elves know not the answer,' said Legolas.        With that the servant of the  Prince came and led them to the Houses of  Healing; and there they found their friends in the garden, and their meeting  was a merry one.  For a while  they walked and talked, rejoicing for a brief  space in peace  and rest under  the morning high up in the windy  circles of  the City. Then when Merry became weary, they went and sat upon the wall  with  the  greensward of  the  Houses of Healing behind them; and  away  southward  before  them was the Anduin glittering in the sun, as it flowed away, out of  the  sight even  of Legolas, into the wide  flats and green haze of Lebennin  and South Ithilien.       And now Legolas fell silent, while the others talked, and he looked out  against the sun,  and as  he  gazed he  saw white sea -birds  beating  up the  River.       'Look!' he cried. 'Gulls! They are flying far inland. A wonder they are  to me and a trouble to my heart. Never in  all my life had I met them, until  we came to  Pelargir, and  there I heard them crying in the air as we rode to  the battle of the ships. Then I stood still, forgetting war in Middle-earth;   ####-for their wailing  voices spoke to me of the Sea. The Sea!  Alas! I have not  yet  beheld  it.  But  deep  in  the  hearts  of  a ll  my  kindred lies  the  sea -longing,  which it is perilous  to stir. Alas! for the  gulls. No  peace  shall I have again under beech or under elm.'       'Say not so!' said Gimli. 'There are  countless things still to see  in  Middle-earth, and great works  to  do. But if  all  the fair folk take to the  Havens, it will be a duller world for those who are doomed to stay."
