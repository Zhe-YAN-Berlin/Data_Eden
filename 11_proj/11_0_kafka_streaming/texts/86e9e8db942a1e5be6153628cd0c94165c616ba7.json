  "text": "           PPPS.  I hope  Butterbur  sends  this promptly.  A  worthy man, but his  memory is  like a lumber-roam: thing wanted always buried. If he  forgets, I   shall roast him.       Fare Well!       Frodo read the letter to himself, and then passed it to Pippin and Sam.  'Really  old Butterbur has  made  a mess of things!' he  said. 'He  deserves  roasting. If  I  had  got this  at  once,  we  might all have  been safe  in  Rivendell  by now. But what can have happened to Gandalf? He writes as if he  was going into great danger.'       'He has been doing that for many years,' said Strider.       Frodo  turned and looked at him thoughtfully, wondering about Gandalf's  second postscript. 'Why didn't you tell me that you were Gandalf's friend at  once?' he asked.  'It would have saved time.'       'Would it? Would any of  you have believed me till now?' said  Strider.  'I knew nothing  of this letter.  For  all I knew I  had  to persuade you to  trust me without proofs, if I was to help you. In any case, I did not intend  to tell you  all about myself at once. I had  to study you  first,  and make  sure of  you. The  Enemy has set traps  for  me before  now. As soon as I had  made up my  mind, I was  ready to tell you  whatever  you asked.  But I must  admit,' he added with a queer laugh,  'that I hoped you would take to me for   my  own  sake. A  hunted  man sometimes  wearies  of distrust  a nd longs for  friendship. But there, I believe my looks are against me.'       'They  are - at first sight at any rate,'  laughed  Pippin with  sudden  relief after reading Gandalf's letter. 'But handsome is as handsome does, as  we  say in the Shire; and  I daresay  we  shall all look much the same after   lying for days in hedges and ditches.'       'It  would  take more than a few days, or weeks, or years, of wandering  in the Wild to make you look like Strider,' he answered. 'And you would  die  first, unless you are made of sterner stuff than you look to be.'       Pippin  subsided; but  Sam was not  daunted, and he  still eyed Strider   dubiously. 'How do we know you are the  Strider that  Gandalf speaks about?'  he  demanded. 'You  never  mentioned Gandalf, till this letter came out. You   might be  a  play-acting spy, for all I can see, trying to get us to go with   ####-you. You might have done in the real Strider and took his clothes. What have  you to say to that?'       'That you are a stout fellow,' answered  Strider;   'but I am  afraid my  only answer to you, Sam Gamgee, is this. If I had killed the real Strider, I  could kill you. And I  should have killed you already without  so much talk.  If I was after the Ring, I could have it - NOW!'       He stood up,  and seemed suddenly to grow taller. In his eyes gleamed a   light, keen and commanding. Throwing back his cloak, he laid his hand on the  hilt of a sword that had  hung concealed by  his  side. They did not dare to  move. Sam sat wide-mouthed staring at him dumbly.       'But I am the real Strider, fortunately,' he said, looking down at them  with his face softened by a sudden smile. 'I am Aragorn son of Arathorn; and  if by life or death I can save you, I will.'       There  was  a long silence.  At last Frodo  spoke  with  hesitation.  'I  believed  that you were  a friend before the letter came,' he  said,  'or at  least I wished to.  You  have frightened me several times tonight, but never   in the way that servants of the Enemy would, or so I imagine. I think one of  his spies would - well, seem fairer and feel fouler, if you understand.'       'I see,' laughed Strider. 'I  look foul and feel fair. Is that  it? All  that is gold does not glitter, not all those who wander are lost.'       'Did the  verses apply to you then?' asked Frodo. 'I could not make out  what they were  about.  But how did  you  know that they  were  in Gandalf's  letter, if you have never seen it?'       'I did not  know,' he answered. 'But I am Aragorn, and  those verses go  with  that  name.' He  drew out his swor d,  and they saw that  the blade was  indeed  broken  a  foot  below  the hilt. 'Not much  use is  it, Sam?'  said  Strider. 'But the time is near when it shall be forged anew.'       Sam said nothing.       'Well,' said Strider, 'with Sam's permission we will call that settled.  Strider shall be your guide. We shall have a rough road tomorrow. Even if we  are allowed  to  leave  Bree unhindered, we can hardly hope now to leave  it   unnoticed. But  I shall try to get  lost as soon as possible.  I know one or   two ways out of Bree-land other than the main road. If once we shake off the  pursuit, I shall make for Weathertop.'       'Weathertop?' said Sam. 'What's that?'       'It is a hill,  just to the north of the Road, about half way from here  to Rivendell.  It commands a wide view all round; and there we shall have  a    ####-chance to look about us. Gandalf will make for that point, if he follows us.  After Weathertop our  journey will become more difficult, and  we shall have  to choose between various dangers."
