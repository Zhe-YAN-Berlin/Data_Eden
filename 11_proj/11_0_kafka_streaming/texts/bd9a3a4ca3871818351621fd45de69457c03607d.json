If there is any other service I might perform, you need only ask.    One thing,  Ned told him.  I should be curious to examine the book that you lent Jon the day before he fell ill.    I fear you would find it of little interest,  Pycelle said.  It was a ponderous tome by Grand Maester Malleon on the lineages of the great houses.    Still, I should like to see it.   The old man opened the door.  As you wish. I have it here somewhere. When I find it, I shall have it sent to your chambers straightaway.    You have been most courteous,  Ned told him. Then, almost as an afterthought, he said,  One last question, if you would be so kind. You mentioned that the king was at Lord Arryn’s bedside when he died. I wonder, was the queen with him?    Why, no,  Pycelle said.  She and the children were making the journey to Casterly Rock, in company with her father. Lord Tywin had brought a retinue to the city for the tourney on Prince Joffrey’s name day, no doubt hoping to see his son Jaime win the champion’s crown. In that he was sadly disappointed. It fell to me to send the queen word of Lord Arryn’s sudden death. Never have I sent off a bird with a heavier heart.    Dark wings, dark words,  Ned murmured. It was a proverb Old Nan had taught him as a boy.   So the fishwives say,  Grand Maester Pycelle agreed,  but we know it is not always so. When Maester Luwin’s bird brought the word about your Bran, the message lifted every true heart in the castle, did it not?    As you say, Maester.    The gods are merciful.  Pycelle bowed his head.  Come to me as often as you like, Lord Eddard. I am here to serve.   Yes, Ned thought as the door swung shut, but whom?  On the way back to his chambers, he came upon his daughter Arya on the winding steps of the Tower of the Hand, windmilling her arms as she struggled to balance on one leg. The rough stone had scuffed her bare feet. Ned stopped and looked at her.  Arya, what are you doing?    Syrio says a water dancer can stand on one toe for hours.  Her hands flailed at the air to steady herself.  Ned had to smile.  Which toe?  he teased.   Any toe,  Arya said, exasperated with the question. She hopped from her right leg to her left, swaying dangerously before she regained her balance.   Must you do your standing here?  he asked.  It’s a long hard fall down these steps.    Syrio says a water dancer never falls.  She lowered her leg to stand on two feet.  Father, will Bran come and live with us now?    Not for a long time, sweet one,  he told her.  He needs to win his strength back.   Arya bit her lip.  What will Bran do when he’s of age?   Ned knelt beside her.  He has years to find that answer, Arya. For now, it is enough to know that he will live.  The night the bird had come from Winterfell, Eddard Stark had taken the girls to the castle godswood, an acre of elm and alder and black cottonwood overlooking the river. The heart tree there was a great oak, its ancient limbs overgrown with smokeberry vines; they knelt before it to offer their thanksgiving, as if it had been a weirwood. Sansa drifted to sleep as the moon rose, Arya several hours later, curling up in the grass under Ned’s cloak. All through the dark hours he kept his vigil alone. When dawn broke over the city, the dark red blooms of dragon’s breath surrounded the girls where they lay.  I dreamed of Bran,  Sansa had whispered to him.  I saw him smiling.    He was going to be a knight,  Arya was saying now.  A knight of the Kingsguard. Can he still be a knight?    No,  Ned said. He saw no use in lying to her.  Yet someday he may be the lord of a great holdfast and sit on the king’s council. He might raise castles like Brandon the Builder, or sail a ship across the Sunset Sea, or enter your mother’s Faith and become the High Septon.  But he will never run beside his wolf again, he thought with a sadness too deep for words, or lie with a woman, or hold his own son in his arms.  Arya cocked her head to one side.  Can I be a king’s councillor and build castles and become the High Septon?    You,  Ned said, kissing her lightly on the brow,  will marry a king and rule his castle, and your sons will be knights and princes and lords and, yes, perhaps even a High Septon.   Arya screwed up her face.  No,  she said,  that’s Sansa.  She folded up her right leg and resumed her balancing. Ned sighed and left her there.  Inside his chambers, he stripped off his sweat-stained silks and sluiced cold water over his head from the basin beside the bed. Alyn entered as he was drying his face.  My lord,  he said,  Lord Baelish is without and begs audience.    Escort him to my solar,  Ned said, reaching for a fresh tunic, the lightest linen he could find.  I’ll see him at once.   Littlefinger was perched on the window seat when Ned entered, watching the knights of the Kingsguard practice at swords in the yard below."
