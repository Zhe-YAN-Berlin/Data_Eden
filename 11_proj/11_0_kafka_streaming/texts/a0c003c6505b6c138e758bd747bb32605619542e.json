  "text": " You will come to  the rapids  of Sarn  Gebir,  and maybe at  last to the  great falls of  Rauros where the  River thunders down from Nen Hithoel; and there  are other perils. Boats may  make your journey less toilsome for  a while.  Yet they  will  not  give you   counsel:  in the  end  you must leave  them and the River, and turn  west -or  east.'       Aragorn  thanked  Celeborn  many times. The gift of boats comforted him  much, not least because there would now be no  need to decide his course for  some days. The others, too, looked more hopeful. Whatever perils  lay ahead,  it seemed better to float down the broad tide of Anduin to meet them than to  plod   forward  with  bent backs. Only Sam was doubtful: he at any rate still  thought boats as bad as wild horses, or worse, and not  all the dangers that  he had survived made him think better of them.       `All shall be prepared for you and await you  at the  haven before noon  tomorrow,'  said  Celeborn.  'I will send my people to you in the morning to  help you make ready for the journey. Now we will  wish  you all a fair night   and untroubled sleep.'       'Good  night,  my friends!  ' said Galadriel.  'Sleep in peace! Do  not  trouble your  hearts overmuch with thought of  the road tonight.  Maybe  the  paths that  you each  shall tread are  already laid before your feet, though  you do not see them. Good night! '       The  Company  now  took  their leave  and  returned to their  pavilion.  Legolas  went with them, for this  was to be their last night in Lothlurien,  and in spite of the words of Galadriel they wished to take counsel together.       For a  long time they debated what they should do, and  how it would be  best to attempt the fulfilling of their purpose with the Ring: but they came  to no decision. It was plain that most of them desired to go  first to Minas  Tirith, and to  escape at least for a while from  the  terror of  the Enemy.  They would have been willing to follow a leader  over the River and into the   shadow of Mordor; but Frodo spoke  no word, and Aragorn was still divided in  his mind.   ####-     His  own  plan, while Gandalf remained with  them, had been to go  with  Boromir, and with his sword help to deliver Gondor. For he believed that the  message of the dreams was a summons, and that the hour had come at last  when  the  heir of  Elendil  should  come  forth and  strive with  Sauron  for the  mastery. But in Moria  the burden of Gandalf had been laid  on  him; and  he   knew that he could not now forsake the Ring, if Frodo refused in  the end to   go with  Boromir. And  yet what help could he or any of the Company give  to  Frodo, save to walk blindly with him into the darkness?        `I shall go to Minas Tirith,  alone if need be, for it is my duty,' said  Boromir; and after  that he was  silent  for a while,  sitting with his eyes  fixed  on Frodo, as if  he was trying  to  read the Halfling's thoughts.  At  length he spoke  again, softly, as if he was debating  with himself. `If you   wish only to destroy  the Ring,' he said,  `then there is little use in  war  and weapons; and the Men of Minas  Tirith  cannot  help.  But if you wish to   destroy the armed might  of the  Dark Lord,  then it is folly  to go without  force into his domain; and folly  to throw away.' He  paused suddenly, as if  he had  become aware that he was  speaking his thoughts aloud. `It  would be  folly  to  throw  lives away,  I  mean,' he ended. `It is  a choice  between  defending a  strong place  and   walking openly  into the arms  of death.  At   least, that is how I see it.'       Frodo caught something  new  and strange  in  Boromir's glance, and  he  looked hard at  him.  Plainly Boromir's thought was different from his final  words. It would be folly to throw away: what? The Ring of Power? He had said  something like this  at the Council, but then he had accepted the correction  of Elrond. Frodo looked at Aragorn,  but he seemed  deep in  his own thought  and made no sign that he  had  heeded Boromir's wor ds.  And so  their debate  ended. Merry and Pippin were  already asleep, and Sam was nodding. The  night  was growing old.       In the  morning, as they were  beginning  to  pack their slender goods,   Elves that could speak their tongue came to them and brought them many gifts  of food and clothing for the  journey.  The food was  mostly in the  form of  very thin cakes, made of a meal that was baked a light brown on the outside,  and inside  was  the colour of  cream. Gimli took  up one  of  the cakes and  looked at it with a doubtful eye.       `Cram,' he said  under his breath,  as he broke off a crisp corner  and   ####-nibbled at it. His expression quickly changed, and  he ate  all the rest  of  the cake with relish.       `No more,  no  more!' cried the  Elves laughing.  `You have eaten enough  already for a long day's march.'       `I thought  it was  only a kind of cram, such as  the Dale-men make for  journeys in the wild,' said the Dwarf."
