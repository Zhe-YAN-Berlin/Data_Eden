  "text": " For do I not guess rightly, Aragorn, that you have shown  yourself to  him in the Stone of Orthanc?'       'I did so  ere I rode from the Hornburg,' answered  Aragorn. 'I  deemed  that the time was ripe, and that the  Stone had  come to me  for just such a   purpose. It was  then ten  days since the Ring-bearer went east from Rauros,   and the Eye of Sauron, I thought, should be drawn out from his own land. Too  seldom has he been challenged since he  returned to his  Tower. Though if  I  had foreseen how swift would be his onset in answer, maybe I should not have  dared to show myself. Bare time was given me to come to your aid.'       'But how is  this?' asked Jomer. 'All is  vain, you say,  if he has the  Ring. Why should he think it not vain to assail us, if we have it?'       'He is not yet sure,' said Gandalf, 'and  he has not built up his power  by waiting until his enemies are secure,  as we have done. Also we could not   learn how to wield the  full  power all in a day. Indeed it can be used only  by one master alone, not by many; and he will look for a time of strife, ere  one  of the great among us makes himself master and puts down the others. In  that time the Ring might aid him, if he were sudden.       'He  is  watching. He sees  much and hears much.  His Nazgyl  are still  abroad. They passed over this field ere the sunrise, though few of the  weary  and sleeping were aware of them. He studies the signs: the Sword that robbed  him of his treasure re-made; the winds of fortune turning in our favour, and  the defeat unlooked-for of his first assault the fall of his great Captain.       'His doubt will  be  growing, even  as we  speak here. His  Eye is  now  straining towards us,  blind  almost to all  else that is moving. So we must  keep it. Therein  lies all our hope. This, then, is my  counsel. We have not  the Ring. In wisdom or  great folly it has been sent away  to be  destroyed,  lest it destroy  us. Without it we  cannot by force defeat his force. But we  must  at all  costs  keep his Eye  from his true  peril. We  cannot  achieve  victory  by  arms, but by arms we can give the Ring-bearer his  only chance,  frail though it be.       'As Aragorn has begun, so  we must go  on. We must push  Sauron  to his  last throw. We must call out his hidden strength, so that he shall empty his   ####-land. We must march out to meet him at  once.  We  must  make ourselves  the  bait, though his jaws  should close  on us. He will take that bait,  in hope  and in  greed, for he will think that in  such rashness he sees the pride of  the new Ringlord: and he will say: \"So!  he pushes out his neck too soon and  too far. Let him come on, and behold I will have him in a trap from which he  cannot escape.  There  I  will  crush  him, and  what he  has taken  in  his  insolence shall be mine again for ever.\"       'We must walk open-eyed into that  trap, with courage,  but small  hope  for ourselves.  For, my  lords,  it may  well prove  that we ourselves shall  perish utterly in  a black battle far from the living lands; so that even if  Barad-dyr  be thrown down, we shall not live to  see a new age.  But this, I  deem, is our  duty. And better so than  to perish nonetheless - as we surely  shall, if we sit here  - and know as we die that no new age shall be.'       They were  silent for a while.  At  length Aragorn  spoke.  'As  I have  begun, so I  will go on.  We  come  now  to the  very brink, where hope  and  despair are akin. To waver is to fall.  Let none  now reject the counsels of  Gandalf,  whose long labours against  Sauron come at last to their test. But  for him all would long ago have been lost. Nonetheless I do not yet claim to   command any man. Let others choose as they will.'       Then said Elrohir: 'From the North we came with this purpose,  and from  Elrond our father we brought this very counsel. We will not turn back.'       'As for  myself,'  said Jomer, 'I have little knowledge of  these  deep  matters; but I need it not. This I know, and it is enough, that as my friend  Aragorn succoured  me and my people, so I will aid him when he calls. I will  go.'       'As  for  me,'  said  Imrahil,  'the  Lord  Aragorn  I  hold to  be  my  liege-lord, whether he  claim it or no. His wish  is to me a command. I will  go also. Yet for a  while I stand in the place of the Steward of Gondor, and  it is mine to think first of its people. To prudence some heed must still be  given. For we must prepare against  all chances, good as well as  evil. Now,   it may be that we shall triumph, and while there is any hope of this, Gondor   must be protected.  I  would not have us return  with victory  to a City  in  ruins and a land ravaged behind us. And yet we learn from the  Rohirrim that  there is an army still unfought upon our northern flank.'       'That is true,' said Gandalf. 'I  do not  counsel you to leave the City  all unmanned.  Indeed  the force that  we lead east need not be great enough  for any  assault in earnest   upon Mordor, so  long as it be great enough  to   ####-challenge battle."
