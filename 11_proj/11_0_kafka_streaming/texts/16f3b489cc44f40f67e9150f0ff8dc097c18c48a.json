It  will be better for him than lying in the dark while others sleep.'       'I will keep  Jomer and ten Riders,'  said the  king. 'They shall  ride  with me at early day.  The rest may go with Aragorn and ride as soon as they  have a mind.'       'As you  will,'  said Gandalf. 'But  make all  the speed you may to the  cover of the hills, to Helm's Deep!'       At that moment  a shadow fell over them. The bright moonlight seemed to  be suddenly cut  off. Several of the Riders cried out, and crouched, holding  their  arms above  their hea ds, as if to ward off a blow from above: a blind  fear and a deadly  cold fell on them. Cowering they looked up. A vast winged  shape  passed over the moon like a  black cloud. It wheeled and went  north,  flying at a speed greater than any wind of Middle-earth. The  stars  fainted  before it. It was gone.       They stood up, rigid as stones. Gandalf was gazing up, his arms out and  downwards, stiff, his hands clenched.       'Nazgyl!' he cried.  'The messenger of Mordor. The storm is coming. The   Nazgyl have crossed the River!  Ride, ride! Wait  not for the  dawn! Let not   the swift wait for the slow! Ride!'       He  sprang  away, calling Shadowfax  as  he ran.  Aragorn followed him.   Going  to Pippin, Gandalf picked him up in his arms. 'You shall come with me  this  time,' he said.  'Shadowfax shall show you his  paces.' Then he ran to  the place  where he had slept. Shadowfax  stood there  already. Slinging the   small bag which was all his luggage  across his  shoulders, the wizard leapt  upon the  horse's back. Aragor n lifted Pippin and set him in Gandalf's arms,    ####-,wrapped in cloak and blanket.       'Farewell! Follow fast!' cried Gandalf. 'Away, Shadowfax!'       The  great  horse  tossed his  head. His  flowing tail  flicked in  the  moonlight. Then he leapt forward, spurning the  earth, and was gone like the  north wind from the mountains.        'A beautiful, restful  night!' said  Merry to Aragorn. 'Some folk  have  wonderful luck. He did not want to sleep, and he wanted to ride with Gandalf  -- and there he goes! Instead of being turned into  a stone himself to stand  here for ever as a warning.'       'If  you had been the first to lift the Orthanc-stone, and not  he, how  would it be now?' said Aragorn. 'You might have done worse. Who can say?  But  now it is your luck to come with me, I fear. At  once. Go and get ready, and   bring anything that Pippin left behind. Make haste!'       Over the  plains  Shadowfax  was  flying,  needing  no  urging  and  no  guidance. Less than  an hour  had  passed, and they had reached the Fords of  Isen and crossed  them. The Mound of the Riders and its cold spears lay grey  behind them.       Pippin was recovering. He  was warm, but the wind in his  face was keen  and refreshing. He was  with  Gandalf. The horror of  the stone  and  of the  hideous shadow over the  moon was fading, things left behind in the mists of  the mountains or in a passing dream. He drew a deep breath.       'I did not know  you rode bare-back, Gandalf,' he said. 'You  haven't a   saddle or a bridle!'       'I  do not ride elf-fashion,  except on Shadowfax,' said Gandalf.  'But  Shadowfax will have no harness. You do not ride Shadowfax:  he is willing to  carry you -or not. If he is willing, that is enough. It  is then his business  to see that you remain on his back, unless you jump off into the air.'       'How  fast is  he going?'  asked Pippin. 'Fast  by  the  wind, but very  smooth. And how light his footfalls are!'       'He  is  running  now  as  fast  as  the swiftest horse could  gallop,'  answered Gandalf; 'but that is not fast for him. The land is rising a little  here, and is more broken than it was beyond the river. But see how the White  Mountains are  drawing near under the stars! Yonder are the  Thrihyrne peaks  like black spears. It will not  be long before we reach the  branching roads  and come to the Deeping-coomb, where the battle was fought two nights ago.'       Pippin was silent again for a while. He heard Gandalf singing softly to   ####-himself, murmuring brief snatches of rhyme in many tongues, as the miles ran  under them. At last the wizard passed into a song of which the hobbit caught   the  words: a few lines came clear  to his  ears  through the rushing of the  wind:       Tall ships and tall kings       Three times three,       What brought they from the foundered land        Over the flowing sea?       Seven stars and seven stones       And one white tree.       'What are you saying, Gandalf?' asked Pippin.       'I was  just  running over  some of the  Rhymes  of  Lore in  my mind '  answered  the wizard. 'Hobbits,  I suppose, have forgotten  them, even those   that they ever knew.'       'No, not  all,'  said  Pippin.  'And  we have many  of our  own,  which  wouldn't interest you, perhaps."
