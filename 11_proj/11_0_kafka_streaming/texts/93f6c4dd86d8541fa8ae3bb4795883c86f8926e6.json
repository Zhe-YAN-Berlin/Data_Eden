And Aragorn is dangerous, and Legolas  is  dangerous. You  are  beset with  dangers,  Gimli  son  of Gluin; for you are  dangerous yourself,  in your own fashion. Certainly the forest of Fangorn is  perilous-not  least to those that are too ready with their axes; and Fangorn  himself, he  is perilous too; yet he is wise and kindly nonetheless. But now   ####-his long slow wrath is brimming over, and all the forest is filled  with it.  The coming of the hobbits and the tidings that they brought have spilled it:  it will soon be running like a flood; but its tide is turned against Saruman  and the axes of Isengard.  A thing is about to happen which has not happened  since the Elder  Days: the Ents are going to wake up and find that they  are  strong.'       'What will they do?' asked Legolas in astonishment.       'I do not know,' said Gandalf. 'I do not think  they know themselves. I  wonder.' He fell silent, his head bowed in thought.       The  others looked  at him. A gleam of sun through fleeting clouds fell  on his hands, which lay now  upturned on his  lap: they seemed to  be filled  with light as  a  cup is with water. At last he looked up and gazed straight  at the sun.       'The morning is wearing away,' he said. 'Soon we must go.'       'Do we go to find our friends and to see Treebeard?' asked Aragorn.       'No,' said Gandalf. 'That is not  the road that  you must take. I  have  spoken words of hope. But only of hope. Hope is not victory. War is       upon us and all  our friends, a war in which only the use  of  the Ring  could give us surety of victory. It fills me with great sorrow and great       fear: for much shall be destroyed and all may be lost. I am Gandalf,       Gandalf the White, but Black is mightier still.'       He rose and gazed out  eastward, shading his eyes, as if he  saw things  far away that none of them could see. Then he shook his head. 'No,' he  said  in  a soft voice, 'it has gone beyond our reach. Of that at least let  us be  glad. We can no longer be tempted to use the Ring. We must go down to face a   peril near despair, yet that deadly peril is removed.'       He turned. 'Come, Aragorn son of  Arathorn!'  he said. 'Do  not  regret  your choice in the valley of the Emyn Muil,  nor call it a vain pursuit. You   chose amid doubts the path that seemed right: the  choice  was just,  and it  has  been rewarded. For so we have met in time, who otherwise might have met  too late. But the quest  of  your companions is over. Your  next  journey is  marked by your given word. You must go to Edoras and seek out Thjoden in  his  hall. For you are needed. The  light of AndÂ®ril must now be uncovered in the  battle for  which it has so long waited. There is  war in  Rohan,  and worse  evil: it goes ill with Thjoden.'       'Then are we not to see the merry young hobbits again?' said Legolas.   ####-     'I  did not say so,' said Gandalf. 'Who knows?  Have patience. Go where  you must go, and hope! To Edoras! I go thither also.'       'It is a long  way for  a man to walk, young or old,'  said Aragorn. 'I  fear the battle will be over long ere I come there. '       'We shall  see,  we  shall see,' said  Gandalf. 'Will you come now with  me?'       'Yes, we will set out together,' said Aragorn. 'But I do not doubt that  you  will  come  there before me, if you wish.' He rose and  looked  long at  Gandalf. The others gazed at them in silence as they stood there facing  one  another. The grey figure of the Man, Aragorn son of Arathorn,  was tall, and  stern as stone, his hand upon the hilt of his sword; he  looked  as  if some  king out of the mists of the sea had stepped upon the  shores of lesser men.  Before him stooped the old figure, white; shining now as if with some  light   kindled within,  bent, laden  with  years,  but holding a  power beyond  the  strength of kings.        'Do I not say truly, Gandalf,' said Aragorn at last, 'that you could go  whithersoever you wished quicker  than  I?  And this I also say: you are our  captain and our banner.  The Dark Lord  has Nine. But we have One,  mightier   than  they: the White Rider. He  has passed through the fire and  the abyss,  and they shall fear him. We will go where he leads.'       'Yes, together we will  follow you,' said Legolas. 'But first, it would  ease my heart, Gandalf, to hear what befell you  in Moria. Will you not tell  us? Can you not stay even to tell your friends how you were delivered?'       'I have stayed already too long,' answered Gandalf. 'Time is short. But  if there were a year to spend, I would not tell you all.'       'Then  tell  us what  you will, and  time allows!'  said  Gimli. 'Come,  Gandalf, tell us how you fared with the Balrog!'       'Name him  not!' said Gandalf,  and for a moment it seemed that a cloud  of pain passed over his face, and he sat silent, looking old as death."
