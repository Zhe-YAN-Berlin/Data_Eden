  "text": "        The  hobbits said nothing. Sam looked at Frodo. At last Frodo spoke. `I   do  not wish to go,' he said; `but neither do I wish to refuse the advice of  Gandalf. I  beg that there should be  no vote,  until we  have slept on  it.  Gandalf will get votes easier in the light of the morning than in this  cold  gloom. How the wind howls! '       At  these  words  all fell  into silent thought. They  heard  the  wind  hissing among the rocks and trees, and there was a howling and wailing round  them in the empty spaces of the night.       Suddenly  Aragorn leapt to  his feet. 'How the wind howls! '  he cried.  'It is howling with wolf-voices. The  Wargs have  come west of the Mountains!   '       'Need we wait until morning then? ' said Gandalf. `It is as I said. The  hunt  is  up! Even if  we live to see the dawn, who now will wish to journey   south by night with the wild wolves on his trail? '       'How far is Moria? ' asked Boromir.       `There was a door south-west  of Caradhras,  some  fifteen miles as the  crow flies, and maybe twenty as the wolf runs,' answered Gandalf grimly.       'Then let  us start as soon as it is light tomorrow, if  we can,'  said  Boromir. 'The wolf that one hears is worse than the orc that one fears.'       `True!' said Aragorn, loosening his sword in its sheath. `But where the  warg howls, there also the orc prowls.'       `I  wish I had taken Elrond's advice,' muttered Pippin to Sam. `I am no  good after all. There is not enough of the breed of Bandobras the Bullroarer   in  me:  these  howls  freeze my  blood.  I  don't ever  remember feeling so  wretched.'       'My heart's  right  down  in my  toes, Mr. Pippin,' said Sam.  'But  we  aren't etten yet,  and there are some stout folk here with  us. Whatever may  be in store for old Gandalf, I'll wager it isn't a wolf's belly.'       For their defence in the  night the Company  climbed to the  top of the  small hill under which they had been sheltering. it was crowned  with a knot   of old and twisted trees, about which lay a broken circle of boulder stones.  In the midst of  this they lit a fire,  for there was  no hope that darkness  and silence would keep their trail from discovery by the hunting packs.        Round the  fire  they  sat,  and those  that  were  not on  guard dozed  uneasily.  Poor  Bill the  pony  trembled  and sweated where he  stood.  The    ####-howling of the wolves was now all round them, sometimes nearer and  sometimes  further off.  In the dead  of the night many shining eyes were  seen peering  over the brow of the  hill. Some advanced almost to the ring of stones. At a   gap  in the circle a great  dark wolf-shape  could be seen halted, gazing at  them.  A shuddering howl  broke from him, as if he  were a captain summoning  his pack to the assault.       Gandalf stood  up and strode forward, holding his staff aloft. 'Listen,  Hound of Sauron! ' he cried. `Gandalf is here.  Fly, if you value  your foul  skin! I will shrivel you from tail to snout, if you come within this ring.'       The wolf snarled and  sprang towards  them  with a great leap.  At that  moment  there was a sharp twang. Legolas  had  loosed his bow.  There  was a   hideous yell, and the leaping shape thudded to  the ground; the elvish arrow  had  pierced  its  throat. The  watching  eyes were  suddenly  extinguished.  Gandalf  and  Aragorn strode forward, but the hill was deserted; the hunting  packs had fled. All about them  the darkness grew silent, and no cry came on  the sighing wind.       The  night was  old, and westward the waning moon was setting. gleaming  fitfully  through the breaking clouds.  Suddenly  Frodo started  from sleep.  Without warning  a  storm of  howls broke out fierce and wild all  about the  camp. A great host of Wargs ha d gathered silently and was now attacking them  from every side at once.       `Fling  fuel on the  fire!' cried  Gandalf to  the  hobbits. `Draw your  blades, and stand back to back!'       In the leaping light, as  the fresh wood blazed up, Frodo saw many gr ey  shapes spring over  the  ring of stones. More and more followed. Through the  throat of one  huge  leader  Aragorn passed his sword with a thrust; with  a   great sweep Boromir hewed the head off another. Beside them Gimli stood  with  his  stout  legs apart,  wielding  his  dwarf-axe.  The  bow of  Legolas was  singing.       In the wavering firelight  Gandalf seemed suddenly to grow: he rose up,  a  great menacing shape like the monument of some ancient king of  stone set  upon a hill. Stooping like a cloud, he lifted a burning branch and strode to  meet the wolves. They gave  back before him. High in  the air he  tossed the  blazing  brand.  It flared with a  sudden white radiance like lightning; and  his voice rolled like thunder.   ####-     `Naur an edraith ammen! Naur dan i ngaurhoth!' he cried.       There was a roar and a crackle, and  the  tree above him  burst  into a   leaf and bloom of blinding flame. The fire leapt  from tree-top to tree-top."
