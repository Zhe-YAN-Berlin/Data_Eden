Slender they looked, but strong,  silken  to the touch, grey of hue like the  elven-cloaks.        `What  are  these?  '  asked  Sam,  handling  one  that  lay  upon  the  greensward.       `Ropes indeed! ' answered an Elf  from the  boats.  'Never  travel  far  without  a rope! And one that is long and strong and light. Such  are these.  They may be a help in many needs.'       'You don't  need to  tell me  that! ' said Sam. `I came without any and  I've been worried ever since. But I was wondering  what these  were made of,   knowing a bit about rope -making: it's in the family as you might say.'       `They are made of hithlain ,' said the Elf, `but there is no time now to  instruct  you  in  the  art of their making. Had we  known that  this  craft   delighted  you, we  could  have taught  you  much. But  now alas! unless you  should at some time return hither, you must be content with our gift. May it  serve you well! '       `Come! ' said Haldir.  `All is now ready  for you. Enter the boats! But  take care at first! '       'Heed the words! ' said the other  Elves. 'These boats are light-built,  and they are crafty and  unlike the boats of other folk. They will not sink,  lade them as you will; but they are wayward if mishandled. It would be  wise  if you accustomed yourselves to stepping  in and out,  here where there is a   landing-place, before you set off downstream.'       The Company  was  arranged in this way: Aragorn, Frodo, and Sam were in  one boat; Boromir,  Merry,  and Pippin  in another; and  in the  third  were  Legolas and Gimli, who  had now become fast friends. In this last boat  most  of  the goods and packs were  stowed. The boats were moved and  steered with  short-handled paddles that had broad leaf-shaped blades. When all  was ready  Aragorn led them  on a trial up  the Silverlode. The current  was  swift and  they went  forward slowly. Sam sat  in the  bows,  clutching the  sides, and  looking back wistfully to  the  shore. The sunlight  glittering on the water   dazzled his eyes.  As they passed beyond the green field of the Tongue,  the  trees  drew down to the  river's  brink. Here and there golden lea ves tossed  and floated on the  rippling stream.  The air was very bright and still, and  there was a silence, except for the high distant song of larks.   ####-     They turned a sharp bend in  the river, and there, sailing proudly down  the stream toward them, they saw a  swan of great size. The water rippled on   either  side of the white  breast beneath its curving neck. Its  beak  shone  like burnished gold, and its eyes glinted like jet set in yellow stones; its  huge white wings  were half lifted.  A music came down the river as it  drew  nearer; and suddenly they perceived that it was  a ship, wrought  and carved  with elven-skill in the likeness of  a bird. Two elves clad in white steered  it  with  black paddles. In the midst of the vessel sat Celeborn, and behind  him  stood Galadriel, tall and white; a circlet of golden flowers was in her   hair, and in her hand she held a harp, and  she sang. Sad and  sweet was the  sound of her voice in the cool clear air:       I sang of leaves, of leaves of gold, and leaves of gold  there grew:        Of wind I sang, a wind there came and in the branches blew.        Beyond the Sun, beyond the Moon, the foam was on the Sea,       And by the strand of Ilmarin there grew a golden Tree.       Beneath the stars of Ever-eve in Eldamar it shone,       In Eldamar beside the walls of Elven Tirion.       There long the golden leaves have grown upon the branching years,       While here beyond the Sundering Seas now fall the Elven-tears.       O Lurien! The Winter comes, the bare and leafless Day;       The leaves are falling in the stream, the River flows away.       O Lurien! Too long I have dwelt upon this Hither Shore       And in a fading crown have twined the golden elanor.       But if of ships I now should sing, what ship would come to me,       What ship would bear me ever back across so wide a Sea?       Aragorn stayed his boat as the Swan-ship drew alongside. The Lady ended  her  song and greeted them. `We have come to bid you our last farewell,' she  said, `and to speed you with blessings from our land . '       `Though  you have  been our guests,'  said Celeborn, `you have  not yet  eaten with  us, and we  bid you, therefore, to a parting feast, here between  the flowing waters that will bear you far from Lurien.'       The Swan passed on slowly to the hythe, and they turned their boats and  followed it. There in the last  end  of  Egladil  upon  the  green grass the  parting feast was held;  but Frodo ate  and drank  little,  heeding only the  beauty of the Lady and her voice. She seemed no longer perilous or terrible,   nor  filled with hidden power. Already she seemed to him, as by men of later  days Elves still  at times are seen: present and yet remote, a living vision   ####-of that  which has already been left far behind by  the  flowing  streams of  Time."
