  "text": "       `Of our  lore and manners they have learned what they would,  and their  lords speak our speech at need; yet for  the most part they hold by the ways  of their  own  fathers and  to their  own  memories, and  they  speak  among  themselves  their own North  tongue. And  we  love them: tall men  and  fair   women,  valiant  both  alike, golden-haired, bright-eyed,  and strong;  they  remind us of the youth of Men, as they were in the  Elder Days. Indeed it is  said by our lore-masters that they  have from of  old  this affinity with us  that they  are  come  from those same  Three  Houses  of  Men  as  were  the  N速menoreans  in  their  beginning  not  from  Hador  the  Goldenhaired,  the  Elf-friend, maybe, yet from such of his sons and people as went not over Sea  into the West, refusing the call.       'For so we reckon Men in our lore, calling them the High, or Men of the  West, which  were N速menoreans; and  the Middle Peoples, Men of the  Twilight,  such as are  the Rohirrim and their kin  that  dwell still far in the North;  and the Wild, the Men of Darkness.        `Yet  now,  if the  Rohirrim are  grown in  some  ways more like to us,  enhanced in arts and gentleness, we too  have become more like  to them, and  can scarce claim any longer the title High. We are become Middle Men, of the  Twilight, but with memory of other things.  For  as the Rohirrim do, we  now  love  war  and valour as things good in themselves, both a sport and an end;   and  though  we still  hold  that  a  warrior  should have more  skills  and  knowledge than only the craft of weapons  and slaying, we esteem a  warrior,  nonetheless, above men  of other  crafts.  Such is the need  of our days. So  even was  my brother,  Boromir:  a  man of  prowess,  and for  that  he  was  accounted the best man in Gondor. And very valiant indeed he was: no heir of  Minas  Tirith has  for long  years  been so hardy  in  toil, so  onward into  battle, or blown a mightier note on the Great Horn.' Faramir sighed and fell  silent for a while.       `You don't say much in all your tales  about the Elves, sir,' said Sam,  suddenly plucking up courage. He  had noted that Faramir seemed  to refer to  Elves with reverence, and this even more than his courtesy, and his food and    ####-wine, had won Sam's respect and quieted his suspicions.       `No indeed, Master Samwise,' said Faramir, `for  I  am  not  learned in  Elven-lore. But there you touch upon another point in which we have changed,  declining from N速menor to  Middle -earth. For as you may know, if   Mithrandir  was  your companion and you have spoken with Elrond, the Edain,  the Fathers  of the  N速menoreans,  fought  beside the  Elves in the first  wars, and were  rewarded by the gift of the kingdom in the midst of the Sea, within sight of  Elvenhome. But in Middle-earth Men and Elves became estranged in the days  of  darkness, by the arts of the Enemy, and by the slow changes of time in which  each  kind  walked  further down  their sundered  roads. Men  now  fear  and   misdoubt the Elves, and yet know little of them. And we of  Gondor grow like  other  Men, like  the men of  Rohan; for even they, who are the  foes of the  Dark Lord, shun the Elves and speak of the Golden Wood with dread.       `Yet there are among us still  some  who have dealings  with the  Elves  when they may, and  ever and anon one will go in secret to  Lurien, seldom to  return. Not I.  For I deem it perilous now for  mortal man  wilfully to seek   out the Elder People. Yet I envy you that have spoken with the White Lady.'       `The Lady of Lurien!  Galadriel!' cried Sam. `You should see her indeed  you should, sir. I am only a hobbit, and gardening's my job at home, sir, if  you understand me, and I'm  not much good at poetry  -- not  at making  it: a   bit of  a comic rhyme, perhaps. now and again, you know, but not real poetry  -- so I can't tell you what I mean. It ought to  be sung. You'd have  to get  Strider,  Aragorn that is, or  old Mr. Bilbo, for that.  But I wish  I could  make a song about her. Beautiful she is, sir! Lovely! Sometimes like a great  tree  in flower,  sometimes like a white  daffadowndilly,  small and  slender   like. Hard  as di'monds, soft as moonlight. Warm as sunlight,  cold as frost   in the stars. Proud and far-off as a snow-mountain, and as merry as any lass  I  ever saw with daisies  in  her hair in  springtime.  But that's a lot  o'  nonsense, and all wide of my mark.'       'Then she must be lovely indeed,' said Faramir. `Perilously fair.'       `I don't know about perilous,' said Sam. `It strikes me that folk takes  their  peril  with them into Lurien,  and finds  it  there  because  they've  brought it. But perhaps you could call her perilous, because she's so strong  in herself. You, you could dash yourself to pieces on her, like a ship on  a   rock;  or drownd  yourself, like a hobbit in a  river. But  neither rock nor    ####-river would be to blame. Now Boro -- ' He stopped and went red in the face."
