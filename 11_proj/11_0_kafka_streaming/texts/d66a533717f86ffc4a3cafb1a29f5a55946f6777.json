Frodo's face was peaceful, the marks of fear and care had left it;  but it looked old,  old and beautiful, as  if the  chiselling of the shaping  years was now revealed  in  many  fine lines  that  had before  been hidden,  though the  identity of the face was not changed. Not that Sam Gamgee put it  that  way to himself.  He shook  his  head, as if finding words useless, and  murmured:  `I  love  him. He's  like that, and  sometimes it shines through,   ####-somehow. But I love him, whether or no.'       Gollum returned quietly  and  peered over  Sam's  shoulder.  Looking at  Frodo, he shut his eyes  and crawled away without a sound. Sam came  to him a   moment later and found him  chewing something  and muttering  to himself.  On  the ground beside him lay two small rabbits, which he was  beginning to  eye  greedily.       'Smjagol always helps,' he said. `He has brought rabbits, nice rabbits.   But ma ster has gone  to sleep,  and perhaps Sam wants to sleep. Doesn't want  rabbits now?  Smjagol  tries  to help,  but he can't catch  things all in  a   minute.'       Sam,  however, had no objection to rabbit at all, and said so. At least  not to cooked rabbit. All hobbits, of  course,  can cook, for they  begin to  learn the art before their letters (which  many never reach):  but Sam was a   good  cook, even by  hobbit  reckoning,  and he had  done a good deal of the  camp-cooking on their travels, when there was a  chance. He  still  hopefully  carried some of his gear in his pack: a  small tinder -box, two small shallow  pans,  the smaller fitting into  the  larger; inside them  a wooden spoon, a   short  two-pronged  fork and  some skewers were  stowed;  and hidden  at the  bottom of the pack in a flat wooden box a dwindling treasure, some salt. But  he needed a  fire, and other things besides. He thought for  a bit, while he  took out his  knife, cleaned and whetted it, and began to dress the rabbits.   He was not going to leave Frodo alone asleep even for a few minutes.       'Now,  Gollum,'  he said, 'I've  another job for you. Go and fill these  pans with water, and bring  'em back!  '       'Smjagol will fetch water, yes,' said Gollum. 'But what does the hobbit  want all that water for? He has drunk, he has washed.'       'Never you mind,' said Sam. `If you  can't guess, you'll soon find out.  And  the  sooner you fetch the  water,  the  sooner you'll  learn. Don't you   damage one of my pans, or I'll carve you into mincemeat.'       While Gollum was  away Sam took  another look  at Frodo.  He  was still  sleeping quietly, but Sam was now struck  most  by the leanness  of his face  and hands. 'Too thin and drawn he is,' he muttered. 'Not right for a hobbit.  If I can get these coneys cooked, I'm going to wake him up.'       Sam gathered a pile of the driest fern, and then scrambled  up the bank   collecting a  bundle of twigs and broken wood; the fallen branch of a  cedar  at the top gave him a good supply. He cut out some turves at the foot of the   ####-bank just outside the fern-brake, and made a shallow hole and laid  his fuel  in it. Being handy with flint and tinder he soon had a small blaze going. It   made little or no smoke but gave off an aromatic scent. He was just stooping   over  his  fire,   shielding it and  building  it up with heavier  wood, when  Gollum returned, carrying the pans carefully and grumbling to himself.        He set the pans down, and then suddenly saw what Sam was doing. He gave  a thin hissing shriek, and seemed to be both frightened and angry. `Ach! Sss  -- no!' he cried. `No! Silly  hobbits, foolish, yes foolish! They mustn't do  it!'       `Mustn't do what?' asked Sam in surprise.       `Not make  the nassty  red  tongues,'  hissed Gollum. `Fire, fire! It's  dangerous, yes it is.  It burns, it kills. And it will  bring enemies, yes it  will.'       'I don't think so,' said  Sam. `Don't see  why it  should, if you don't  put wet stuff on it and make a  smother.  But if it does, it does. I'm going  to risk it, anyhow. I'm going to stew these coneys.'       'Stew the rabbits!'  squealed Gollum in  dismay. `Spoil  beautiful meat  Smjagol  saved for  you,  poor  hungry  Smjagol! What for? What  for,  silly  hobbit? They are young, they are tender, they are nice. Eat them, eat them!'  He clawed a t the nearest rabbit, already skinned and lying by the fire.       `Now, now! ' said Sam. `Each to his own fashion. Our bread chokes  you,  and raw  coney chokes me. If you give  me a coney, the coney's mine, see, to  cook,  if  I have  a mind. And  I have.  You needn't watch me.  Go and catch   another  and eat it as you  fancy  -- somewhere private  and out o' my sight.  Then you  won't see the  fire, and  I shan't see you, and we'll both  be the  happier. I'll see the fire don't smoke, if that's any comfort to you.'       Gollum withdrew grumbling,  and  crawled  into  the  fern."
