It was not until  Frodo commanded him angrily and  laid a hand on  his sword-hilt  that Gollum  would get up again. Then at last he rose with  a snarl, and went before them  like a beaten dog.       So they stumbled on through  the weary end  of the night, and until the  coming  of another  day of  fear they walked  in silence with  bowed  heads,   seeing nothing, and hearing nothing but the wind hissing in their ears.     ####-   Chapter 3. The Black Gate is Closed            Before  the  next day dawned  their journey to  Mordor  was  over.  The  marshes and the desert  were  behind them. Before  them, darkling  against a   pallid sky, the great mountains reared their threatening heads.        Upon the west of  Mordor marched the gloomy range  of  Ephel D®ath, the  Mountains of Shadow, and upon the north  the broken peaks and barren  ridges  of  Ered  Lithui, grey as ash. But as these ranges  approached one  another,  being indeed  but  parts  of  one  great  wall about  the mournful plains of  Lithlad and of Gorgoroth, and the bitter inland sea of N®rnen amidmost, they  swung out  long arms northward;  and between  these arms  there  was a  deep  defile.  This was Cirith Gorgor,  the Haunted Pass, the entrance to the land  of the Enemy. High cliffs lowered upon either side, and thrust forward  from  its mouth were two  sheer  hills, black -boned and bare. Upon  them stood the  Teeth  of  Mordor, two towers strong and  tall. In days long past they  were  built by the Men of Gondor in their pride and power,  after the overthrow of  Sauron and his flight, lest he  should seek to return to his old realm.  But  the strength of Gondor  failed, and men slept, and for long years the towers  stood  empty.  Then Sauron returned. Now  the watch-towers, which  had fallen  into  decay,  were  repaired, and  filled  with arms,  and  garrisoned  with  ceaseless vigilance. Stony-faced they were, with  dark  window-holes staring  north and east and west, and each window was full of sleepless eyes.       Across the  mouth of the pass, from cliff to cliff,  the Dark Lord  had  built a rampart of stone. In it  there  was a single gate of  iron, and upon  its battlement sentinels paced unceasingly. Beneath the hills on either side  the  rock  was bored into  a hundred caves and maggot -holes: there a host of  orcs lurked, ready at a signal to issue forth like black ants going to  war.  None could pass the  Teeth of  Mordor and not feel  their bite, unless  they  were summoned by Sauron, or knew the  secret  passwords  that would open  the  Morannon, the black gate of his land.       The two hobbits  gazed at the towers and the wall in despair. Even from  a distance they could see  in the dim light the movement of the black guards  upon the wall,  and  the patrols before the gate. They lay now peering  over   the edge of a rocky hollow beneath the out-stretched shadow of the northmost    ####-buttress of Ephel D®ath. Winging  the heavy air in a straight flight a crow,  maybe, would have flown  but a furlong from  their hiding-place to the  black  summit  of  the  nearer  tower. A faint smoke curled  above it, as  if  fire  smouldered in the hill beneath.       Day  came, and the fallow sun blinked over the lifeless  ridges of Ered  Lithui.  Then su ddenly the cry of brazen-throated  trumpets was  heard: from  the watch-towers they blared, and far away from hidden holds and outposts in  the  hills  came  answering calls; and  further  still, remote but  deep and  ominous, there echoed in  the hollow land  beyond the mighty horns  and drums  of Barad-dyr. Another dreadful day of fear and toil had come to Mordor;  and  the night-guards were  summoned to their dungeons and  deep  halls, and  the  day-guards, evil-eyed and fell,  were marching to their posts. Steel gleamed  dimly on the battlement.       `Well, here we are! ' said Sam. `Here's the Gate, and it looks to me as  if that's about as far as we are ever going  to get. My word, but the Gaffer   would have a thing or two to say, if he saw me now! Often said I'd come to a  bad  end, if I didn't watch my step, he  did. But  now I don't suppose  I'll  ever see  the  old fellow again. He'll miss his chance of  I told'ee so, Sam:  more's the  pity. He could go on telling me as  long as he'd got breath,  if  only I could see his old face again. But I'd have to get a wash first, or he  wouldn't know me.       `I suppose it's no good asking \"what way do we go now?\" We  can't go no  further -unless we want to ask the orcs for a lift.'       `No, no! ' said Gollum. `No use. We can't  go further. Smjagol  said so.  He said: we'll go to the Gate, and then we'll see. And we do see. O yes.  my  precious, we do see. Smjagol  knew  hobbits  could  not  go this way. O yes.   Smjagol knew '       'Then  what the plague  did you  bring  us here  for? '  said  Sam, not  feeling in the mood to be just or reasonable."
