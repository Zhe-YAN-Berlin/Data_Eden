  "text": " It is the opening of day in the sky-fields.'       'Then  we must  set  out  as soon as may be,' said Jomer.  'Even so  we  cannot hope to come to Gondor's aid today.'       Merry waited to  hear  no  more, but slipped away to get ready for  the  summons to the march. This was  the last stage before the battle. It did not  seem  likely to him  that  many of them would survive it. But he thought  of  Pippin and the flames in Minas Tirith and thrust down his own dread.       All  went well that day, and no sight  or sound had  they  of the enemy  waiting to waylay them. The Wild Men had put  out a screen  of wary hunters,   so that no orc or roving spy should learn of the movements in the hills. The  light was more dim  than ever as they drew nearer to  the  beleaguered city,  and the Riders  passed  in long files like dark shadows  of men and  hor ses.  Each  company  was guided by  a wild woodman; but old Ghvn walked beside  the  king. The  start had been slower than was  hoped, for it had  taken time for   the Riders, walking and leading their horses, to find paths over the thickly  wooded ridges behind   their camp  and down into the hidden Stonewain Valley.  It was  late in the afternoon  when the leaders came  to wide  grey thickets  stretching beyond the eastward side of  Amon Don, and masking a great gap in  the line of hills that from Nardol to Don ran east and west. Through the gap  the forgotten wain-road long ago had run down,  back into the main horse -way  from the City  through Anurien; but now for many lives of men  trees had had  their way with  it, and it had vanished, broken and buried under  the leaves  of uncounted years. But  the  thickets offered to the Riders their last hope  of cover before they went into open battle; for beyond them lay the road and  the plains  of Anduin,  while east and southwards  the slopes  were bare and   rocky,  as the writhen hills  gathered  themselves  together and climbed up,  bastion upon bastion, into the great mass and shoulders of Mindolluin.       The leading company was halted, and as those behind filed up out of the  trough of the Stonewain Valley they spread out  a nd passed to camping-places  under the grey trees. The king  summoned the captains to council. Jomer sent  out scouts to spy upon the road; but old Ghvn shook his head.       'No good to send Horse-men,' he said. 'Wild Men  have already  seen all  that can be seen in the bad air. They will come soon and speak to me here.'       The  captains came;  and  then  out of  the  trees crept  warily  other   pÂ®kel-shapes so like old Ghvn that Merry  could hardly tell them apart. They  spoke to Ghvn in a strange throaty language.   ####-     Presently Ghvn turned to the king. 'Wild Men say many things ' he said.  'First, be wary! Still many  men in camp beyond Don, an hour's walk yonder,'  he waved  his arm west  towards the black beacon. 'But  none  to see between  here and Stone-folk's new walls. Many busy  there. Walls stand up no longer:  gorgyn  knock them down with earth -thunder and with clubs of black iron. They  are unwary and do not  look about  them. They think  their friends watch all   roads!' At that old  Ghvn made a curious gurgling noise, and it seemed  that  he was laughing.       'Good tidings!' cried Jomer. 'Even in this gloom hope gleams again. Our  Enemy's devices  oft serve us in his  despite.  The accursed darkness itself  has been a cloak to us. And now, lusting to destroy Gondor and throw it down  stone from stone, his  orcs have  taken away  my greatest fear. The out-wall  could have been held long against us. Now we  can sweep through - if once we  win so far.'       'Once again I thank you, Ghvn-buri-Ghvn of  the woods,'  said  Thjoden.   'Good fortune go with you for tidings and for guidance!'       'Kill  gorgyn! Kill orc-folk! No other words please Wild Men ' answered   Ghvn. 'Drive away bad air and darkness with bright iron!'       'To do these things we have ridden far,'  said the king,  'and we shall  attempt them. But what we shall achieve only tomorrow will show.'       Ghvn-buri-Ghvn  squatted down and touched the earth with his horny brow  in token of farewell. Then he got up as if to depart.  But suddenly he stood  looking u p like some startled  woodland  animal snuffling  a  strange air. A  light came in his eyes.        'Wind  is  changing!' he cried, and  with  that, in a  twinkling as  it  seemed, he and his fellows had vanished into the glooms, never to be seen by  any Rider of Rohan again. Not long after far away  eastward  the faint drums  throbbed again. Yet  to no heart in all the host came any fear that the Wild  Men were unfaithful, strange and unlovely though they might appear.       'We need  no further  guidance,' said E lfhelm; 'for there are riders in  the host who have ridden down to Mundburg in days of peace. I for  one. When  we come to  the road it will veer south, and there will lie before  us still  seven leagues ere we reach the wall of the townlands."
