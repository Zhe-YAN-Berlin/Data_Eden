  "text": " We shall meet bitter cold, if no worse, before we come down  on the other side. It will not help  us to keep so secret that we are frozen  to death. When we leave here, where  there are still a few trees and bushes,   each of us should carry a faggot of wood, as large as he can bear.'       'And Bill could take a bit more, couldn't  you lad?' said Sam. The pony  looked at him mournfully.       'Very well,' said Gandalf. `But we must not  use the wood -- not unless  it is a choice between fire and death.'       The Company set out again with good speed at first; but soon their  way  became steep  and  difficult.  The twisting  and climbing road  had  in many   places almost disappeared, and was  blocked  with  many fallen  stones.  The  night grew deadly dark under great clouds. A  bitter wind swirled among  the  rocks. By midnight they had climbed to the knees of the great mountains. The  narrow path now wound  under a sheer wall of cliffs to the left, above which   the grim flanks of Caradhras towered up invisible in the gloom; on the right   was a gulf of darkness where the land fell suddenly into a deep ravine.       Laboriously they climbed a  sharp slope and halted for a  moment at the  top. Frodo felt a soft touch on his face. He put out his arm and saw the dim  white flakes of snow settling on his sleeve.       They went on. But before  long the snow was falling fast,  filling  all  the air, and swirling into Frodo's eyes. The dark bent shapes of Gandalf and  Aragorn only a pace or two ahead could hardly be seen.       'I don't like this at all,' panted Sam  just behind.  'Snow's all right  on a fine morning,  but I like to be in  bed while it's falling. I wish this  lot would  go off to Hobbiton! Folk  might  welcome  it there.' Except on the  high moors of the Northfarthing a heavy fall was rare in the Shire,  and was  regarded as  a pleasant event and  a chance for fun. No  living hobbit (save   ####-Bilbo) could remember the Fell Winter of 1311, when the white wolves  invaded  the Shire over the frozen Brandywine.       Gandalf  halted. Snow  was  thick on  his  hood and  shoulders;  it was  already ankle-deep about his boots.        \"This is what I feared,' he said. `What do you say now, Aragorn?'       'That I feared  it too,' Aragorn answered, `but less than other things.  I knew the  risk of  snow, though it seldom falls heavily so far south, save  high up in the mountains. But we are not  high yet;  we are still  far down,  where the paths are usually open all the winter.'       'I wonder if this  is a contrivance  of the Enemy,' said Boromir. \"They  say in my land that he can govern the storms in the Mountains of Shadow that  stand upon the borders of Mordor. He has strange powers and many allies.'       'His arm  has grown long indeed,' said Gimli, `if he can draw snow down  from the North to trouble us here three hundred leagues away.'       'His arm has grown long,' said Gandalf.       While  they  were halted,  the wind died  down, and the snow  slackened  until  it almost ceased. They tramped on again.  But they had not  gone more  than a  furlong when the storm returned with fresh  fury. The  wind whistled  and  the snow became a blinding blizzard. Soon even Boromir found it hard to  keep going. The hobbits, bent nearly double, toiled along behind  the taller  folk, but it was  plain  that they could not  go much  further,  if the snow  continued.  Frodo's  feet felt like lead. Pippin  was dragging behind.  Even  Gimli, as stout as any dwarf could be, was grumbling as he trudged.       The Company  halted  suddenly, as if  they  had  come  to  an agreement  without any words  being  spoken. They  heard eerie noises in  the  darkness  round them.  It may have been only a  trick of  the wind in  the cracks  and  gullies  of the  rocky wall, but the sounds were those of shrill  cries, and  wild  howls  of  laughter.  Stones  began  to  fall  from the mountain-side,  whistling over  their heads, or crashing on the path beside them. Every  now  and  again they heard a dull  rumble,  as a gr eat  boulder rolled  down from  hidden heights above.       `We cannot go further  tonight,' said Boromir. `Let those  call it  the  wind who will; there are fell voices on the  air; and these stones are aimed  at us.'       `I do call it the wind,' said Aragor n. `But that does not make what you   say untrue. There are many evil and unfriendly things in the world that have   ####-little  love for those that go on two legs, and  yet are not in  league with  Sauron, but have purposes of  their own. Some have been in this world longer   than he.'       'Caradhras was called the Cruel, and had an ill name, said Gimli, `long  years ago, when rumour of Sauron had not been heard in these lands.'       `It matters little who is the enemy, if we cannot beat off  his attack;  said Gandalf.       'But what can we do?'  cried Pippin miserably. He  was leaning on Merry  and Frodo, and he was shivering.       `Either stop where we are, or  go back,' said Gandalf."
