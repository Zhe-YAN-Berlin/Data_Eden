  "text": " An angry Ent is terrifying. Their fingers,   and  their toes,  just  freeze  on  to  rock;  and  they  tear  it  up  like  bread-crust. It was like watching the work of  great tree-roots in a hundred  years, all packed into a few moments.       'They pushed,  pulled,  tore,  shook,  and  hammered;  and  clang-bang,  crash-crack,  in five minutes they had these huge gates just lying in  ruin;  and  some were  already beginning to eat into  the walls,  like rabbits in a   sand-pit. I don't know what Saruman thought was happening; but anyway he  did   ####-not know how to deal with it. His wizardry may have been falling off lately,   of course;  but anyway  I think he has not much grit, not much plain courage  alone in a tight place without a lot of  slaves and machines  and things, if  you  know what I mean. Very different from old Gandalf. I wonder if his fame  was not all along mainly due to his cleverness in settling at Isengard.'       'No,'  said  Aragorn. 'Once he was as  great as his fame made h im.  His  knowledge  was deep,  his thought  was  subtle,  and his hands  marvellously   skilled; and  he  had  a power  over the  minds of others. The wise he could  persuade, and the smaller folk he could daunt. That power he certainly still  keeps. There are not  many in Middle-earth that I  should  say were safe, if  they were  left  alone to talk with him,  even now  when he  has suffered  a   defeat. Gandalf, Elrond, and Galadriel, perhaps, now that his wickedness has  been laid bare, but very few others.'       'The Ents are safe,' said Pippin. 'He seems  at one  time to  have  got  round them, but never again. And anyway  he did  not understand them; and he  made  the great mistake of  leaving them out of his  calculations. He had no  plan for them, and there was no time to make any, once they had set to work.  As  soon  as  our  attack began,  the few remaining rats in Isengard started  bolting through  every  hole that the Ents  made.  The Ents  let the Men go,  after they had questioned them, two or three dozen only down  at this end. I  don't think many orc-folk, of any size, escaped. Not  from the Huorns: there  was a wood  full of them all round Isengard by  that time, as well as  those  that had gone down the valley.       'When  the  Ents  had reduced a large part  of  the  southern walls  to  rubbish,  and  what was  left of his people  had  bolted  and  deserted him,  Saruman fled in a panic. He seems to have been at the gates when we arrived:  I expect he came  to watch his splendid army march out. When the  Ents broke  their  way in,  he  left in a hurry. They did not spot him at first. But the  night had opened out, and there was a great light of stars, quite enough for   Ents to see by,  and suddenly  Quickbeam  gave a  cry  \"The tree-killer, the  tree-killer!\"  Quickbeam is a gentle creature, but he  hates Saruman all the  more fiercely for that: his people suffered cruelly from orc-axes. He  leapt  down the path from the inner gate, and he  can  move like a wind when  he is  roused. There was a pale figure hurrying away  in and out of the  shadows of  the pillars, and it had nearly reached the stairs  to the tower -door. But it  was a near thing. Quickbeam was so hot after  him, that he was within a step  or two of being caught and strangled when he slipped in through the door.   ####-     'When Saruman  was  safe back in Orthanc, it was not long before he set  some of  his precious machinery to work. By  that time there were  many Ents  inside  Isengard: some  had followed Quickbeam, and others had burst in from  the  north  and  east ; they were roaming  about and  doing a great  deal  of  damage. Suddenly up came fires and foul fumes: the vents and shafts all over  the  plain began to spout  and belch. Several of the Ents  got scorched  and  blistered.  One of them,  Beechbone  I  think he was  called,  a  very  tall  handsome Ent,  got caught in a spray of some  liquid fire and burned like  a   torch: a horrible sight.       'That sent them mad. I thought that they had been really roused before;  but  I  was wrong. I saw  what it was like at last.  It was staggering. They  roared and boomed and trumpeted, until stones began to crack and fall at the   mere noise of them. Merry  and  I lay on  the  ground and stuffed our cloaks  into our ears. Round  and  round the  rock of Orthanc the Ents went striding  and  storming like a howling gale, breaking pillars,  hurling avalanches  of  boulders  down the shafts, tossing up huge slabs of stone into the air  like  leaves.  The tower was in the  middle  of a spinning  whirlwind. I  saw iron  posts  and blocks of  masonry go rocketing  up hundreds  of feet, and  smash  against the windows  of Orthanc. But Treebeard kept his head. He had not had  any burns, luckily. He  did not want  his  folk to hurt themselves in  their  fury,  and  he  did  not  want  Saruman to  escape out of some hole  in  the   confusion.   Many  of  the   Ents   were   hurling  themselves  against  the  Orthanc-rock;  but that defeated  them."
