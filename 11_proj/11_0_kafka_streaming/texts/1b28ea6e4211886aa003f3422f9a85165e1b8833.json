  "text": " It seems a long while since we could eat  to heart's content.'       'It does not seem to have done you any harm,' said Aragorn. 'Indeed you   look in the bloom of health.'       'Aye, you do indeed,' said Gimli, looking them up and down over the top    ####-of his cup. 'Why,  your hair is twice as thick and curly  as when we parted;  and I would swear that you have both grown somewhat, if that is possible for  hobbits of your age. This Treebeard at any rate has not starved you.'       'He has not,' said Merry. 'But Ents on ly drink, and drink is not enough  for content. Treebeard's draughts may be nourishing,  but one feels the need  of something solid. And even lembas is none the worse for a change.'       'You have drunk of  the waters of the  Ents, have  you?'  said Legolas.   'Ah, then I think it is likely that Gimli's eyes do not deceive him. Strange  songs have been sung of the draughts of Fangorn.'       'Many strange tales  have been told about that land,' said Aragorn.  'I   have never entered it. Come, tell me more about it, and about the Ents!'       'Ents,'  said Pippin,  'Ents are -- well  Ents are all different for on  thing. But their eyes now, their eyes are very odd.' He tried a few fumbling  words that trailed  off into silence. 'Oh, well,' he went on, 'you have seen  some at a distance, already -they saw you  at any rate, and reported that you   were on  the way-and you  will see many others,  I  expect, before you leave  here. You must form your own ideas.'       'Now,  now!' said Gimli. 'We are beginning the story  in the middle.  I  should like a tale in the  right order,  starting with that strange day when  our fellowship was broken.'       'You  shall have it, if there  is time,'  said Merry. 'But first -if you   have finished eating-you shall fill  your pipes and light up. And  then for a   little while we can pretend that we are all back safe  at Bree again,  or in  Rivendell.'       He produced a small leather bag full of tobacco. 'We have heaps of it,'  he said; 'and you can all pack as much as you wish, when we go. We  did some  salvage-work  this morning, Pippin and I. There are lots of things  floating  about. It  was Pippin who found two  small barrels,  washed up  out of  some   cellar  or  store-house, I suppose. When we opened them, we found they  were  filled with this:  as fine  a  pipe-weed  as  you could  wish  for, and quite  unspoilt.'       Gimli  took some  and rubbed it in his  palms and sniffed it. 'It feels  good, and it smells good,' he said.       'It is good!' said  Merry. 'My dear Gimli, it is Longbottom Leaf! There  were  the  Hornblower brandmarks on the barrels, as  plain as plain.  How it   came here, I can't imagine. For Saruman's private use. I fancy. I never knew  that it went so far abroad. But it comes in handy now?'   ####-     'It  would,' said Gimli, 'if I had a pipe to go  with it. Alas, I  lost  mine in Moria, or before. Is there no pipe in all your plunder?'       'No, I am  afraid  not,' said Merry. 'We have  not found any, not  even  here in the guardrooms. Saruman kept this dainty to himself. it seems. And I   don't think it would be any use knocking on the doors of  Orthanc  to beg  a   pipe of him! We shall have to share pipes. as good friends must at a pinch.'       'Half a moment!' said Pippin. Putting his hand inside the breast of his  jacket he pulled out a little soft wallet on a string. 'I keep a treasure or   two near my  skin, as precious as  Rings  to  me.  Here's one: my old wooden  pipe.  And  here's another: an unused one. I have carried  it  a  long way,,  though  I don't know why.  I never really expected to find  any pipe-weed on  the journey, when my own ran  out. But now it comes in useful after all.' He  held  up a small  pipe with a wide  flattened bowl, and handed it to  Gimli.  'Does that settle the score between  us?' he said. 'Settle it!' cried Gimli.  'Most noble hobbit, it leaves me deep in your debt.'       'Well, I am going back into the  open air, to see what the wind and sky  are doing!' said Legolas.        'We will come with you,' said Aragorn.       They went  out and seated themselves  upon the piled stones before  the  gateway. They could see far down into the valley now; the mists were lifting   and floating away upon the breeze.       'Now let  us take our ease  here for a little!' said Aragorn.  'We will  sit  on the  edge  of  ruin and talk,  as Gandalf  says,  while  he  is busy  elsewhere. I feel a weariness such as I have seldom felt before.' He wrapped   his grey cloak about him, hiding  his mail-shirt, and stretched out his long  legs. Then he lay back and sent from his lips a thin stream of smoke.       'Look!' said Pippin. 'Strider the Ranger has come back!'       'He has never been away,' said Aragorn.  'I am Strider and DÂ®nadan too,   and I belong both to Gondor and the North.'       They smoked in silence for a while, and the sun shone on them; slanting  into the valley from among white clouds high in the West."
