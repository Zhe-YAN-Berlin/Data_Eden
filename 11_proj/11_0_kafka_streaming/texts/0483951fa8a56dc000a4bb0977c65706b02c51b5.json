  "text": " I thought at first that this here Redhorn,  or  whatever its  name is, might  be it, till Gimli spoke his piece.  A fair  jaw-cracker dwarf-language  must be!' Maps  conveyed nothing  to Sam's mind,  and all  distances in  these strange lands  seemed so vast that he was quite  out of his reckoning.       All that day the Company remained in hiding. The dark birds passed over   now  and  again;  but  as  the  westering  Sun  grew  red  they  disappeared  southwards. At dusk  the  Company set out, and  turning  now half  east they  steered their course towards  Caradhras, which far away still glowed faintly  red  in the last  light of the vanished Sun. One  by one  white stars sprang  forth as the sky faded.       Guided by Aragorn they struck a good path. It looked to Frodo   like the  remains of an ancient road, that had once been broad and  well planned, from  Hollin to the  mountain -pass.  The  Moon, now  at the  full,  rose  over the  mountains, and cast a pale light in which the shadows of stones were  black.  Many  of  them looked  to  have been worked by hands, though  now  they  lay  tumbled and ruinous in a bleak, barren land.       It  was the cold chill hour before the first stir of dawn, and the moon  was low. Frodo looked  up at the sky. Suddenly  he saw or felt a shadow  pass  over the high  stars, as  if for a  moment they faded  and  then flashed out  again. He shivered.       `Did you see anything pass over?' he whispered to Gandalf, who was just   ahead.       `No, but I felt it, whatever  it was,' he answered. `It may be nothing,  only a wisp of thin cloud.'       `It was moving fast then,' muttered Aragorn, `and not with the wind.'       Nothing  further  happened  that  night.  The next morning  dawned even   brighter  than  before.  But the air was chill  again; already  the wind was  turning back towards the east. For two more nights they marched on, climbing  steadily but ever more slowly as their road wound up into the hills, and the  mountains towered up, nearer and nearer. On the third morning Caradhras rose  before  them, a mighty peak, tipped with  snow  like silver, but with  sheer    ####-naked sides, dull red as if stained with blood.       There was a  black look in the sky, and  the sun was wan. The  wind had  gone now round to the north-east. Gandalf snuffed the air and looked ba ck.       `Winter deepens behind us,' he said quietly to  Aragorn.  'The  heights  away  north  are whiter  than  they  were;  snow  is  lying far  down  their  shoulders. Tonight we shall be on our way high up  towards the Redhorn Gate.  We  may well be seen  by watchers  on that narrow path,  and waylaid by some  evil;  but the weather may prove a  more deadly enemy than any. What  do you   think of your course now, Aragorn?'       Frodo overheard  these  words, and understood that  Gandalf and Aragorn  were  continuing  some  debate  that  had  begun  long before.  He  listened  anxiously.       'I think no good of our course from beginning to end, as you know well,  Gandalf,' answered Aragorn. `And perils known and unknown will grow as we  go  on. But we must  go on; and it is no good our  delaying  the passage  of the  mountains. Further south  there are no passes, till one comes to the Gap  of  Rohan.  I do not trust  that way since your news of Saruman. Who knows  which  side now the marshals of the Horse-lords serve?'       'Who knows indeed!' said Gandalf. `But there is another way, and not by   the pass of Caradhras: the dark and secret way that we have spoken of.'       'But let us not speak of it again! Not yet. Say nothing to the others I  beg, not until it is plain tha t there is no other way.'       'We must decide before we go further,' answered Gandalf.       'Then let us weigh  the matter in our  minds, while the others rest and  sleep,' said Aragorn.       In the late afternoon, while the others were finishing their breakfast,  Gandalf and Aragorn  went aside together and stood looking at Caradhras. Its  sides  were now dark  and sullen, and  its head  was in  grey  cloud.  Frodo  watched them, wondering which way the debate would go. When they returned  to  the Company Ganda lf spoke, and then he knew that it had been decided to face  the weather and the high  pass. He was relieved. He could not guess what was  the other dark and secret way, but the very mention of it had seemed to fill  Aragorn with dismay, and Frodo was glad that it had been abandoned.       `From signs that we have  seen lately,' said Gandalf,  'I fear that the   ####-Redhorn Gate may be  watched; and also  I have doubts of the weather that is  coming up behind. Snow may come. We must go  with all the speed that we  can.  Even so it will take us more than two marches before we reach the top of the   pass.  Dark will come early this evening. We must leave  as  soon as you can  get ready.'       'I will  add a  word of  advice, if I  may,'  said Boromir. 'I was born  under the shadow of the White Mountains and  know  something of journeys   in  the high places."
