Holding aloft the Phial Frodo looked and  before him he  saw a greyness  which the radiance of the star-glass did not pierce  and did not illuminate,  as  if it  were  a  shadow that  being cast  by  no  light,  no  light could  dissipate. Across the  width and height of the  tunnel a  vast web was spun,  orderly as the web of some huge spider,  but  denser -woven  and far greater,   and each thread was as thick as rope.       Sam  laughed grimly.  `Cobwebs! '  he said. `Is that all?  Cobwebs! But  what a spider! Have at 'em, down with 'em! '       In a fury he  hewed at  them with his  sword,  but  the thread  that he  struck did  not break.  It gave a little and then sprang back like a plucked  bowstring,  turning the blade and tossing up both sword and a rm. Three times  Sam struck with all  his  force, and  at last  one single cord  of  all  the  countless  cords snapped and twisted, curling and whipping through  the air.   One end of it lashed Sam's hand, and he cried out in pain, starting back and  drawing h is hand across his mouth.       `It will take days to clear the road like this,' he said. `What's to be  done? Have those eyes come back? '   ####-     `No, not  to be seen,' said  Frodo.  `But  I still  feel  that they are  looking at me,  or  thinking about me: making some  other plan,  perhaps. If  this light were lowered, or if it failed, they would quickly come again.'       `Trapped in the end!  ' said Sam bitterly, his anger rising again above  weariness and despair. `Gnats  in a net. May the curse of Faramir bite  that  Gollum and bite him quick! '       'That would not help us now,' said Frodo. `Come! Let us see what  Sting  can  do. It is an elven-blade. There were webs of horror in the dark ravines  of  Beleriand where it was forged.  But you must be the  guard and hold back  the eyes. Here,  take  the  star -glass.  Do  not be afraid. Hold  it  up and  watch!'       Then Frodo stepped up to the great grey  net, and hewed it  with a wide  sweeping stroke,  drawing  the  bitter  edge  swiftly  across  a  ladder  of  close-strung cords, and  at  once  springing  away. The  blue-gleaming blade  shore through them like a scythe through grass, and they  leaped and writhed  and then hung loose. A great rent was made.       Stroke  after  stroke he dealt, until at last  all the  web within  his  reach was shattered, and the upper portion blew and swayed like a loose veil   in the incoming wind. The trap was broken.       `Come! ' cried Frodo. `On! On! ' Wild joy at their escape from the very  mouth  of despair suddenly filled  all his mind. His head whirled as  with a   draught of potent wine. He sprang out, shouting as he came.       It seemed light in that  dark land to his eyes  that had passed through  the den of night. The great smokes had risen and grown thinner, and the last   hours of a  sombre day were passing; the red glare of Mordor had died away in  sullen gloom. Yet it seemed to Frodo that he looked upon a morning of sudden  hope. Almost he had reached  the  summit of the  wall. Only  a little higher   now. The Cleft,  Cirith  Ungol, was before him, a dim  notch  in  the  black   ridge, and the horns of rock darkling  in  the sky on either side.  A  short  race, a sprinter's course and he would be through!        `The pass,  Sam! ' he  cried, not heeding the shrillness of  his voice,  that  released  from  the choking airs of the  tunnel  rang out now high and  wild. 'The  pass! Run, run, and we'll be  through-through before any one can  stop us! '       Sam came  up  behind as fast as he could  urge his legs; but glad as he  was  to be free, he was uneasy, and as he ran, he kept on  glancing back  at  the dark  arch of the tunnel, fearing to see eyes, or some  shape beyond his   ####-imagining,  spring out in  pursuit. Too little did he or  his master know of  the craft of Shelob. She had many exits from her  lair.       There agelong she had dwelt, an evil thing in spider -form, even such as  once of old had lived in the Land of the Elves in the West that is now under   the Sea, such as Beren fought in the Mountains of Terror  in Doriath, and so  came to L®thien upon the green sward amid the hemlocks in the moonlight  long  ago. How Shelob came there, flying from ruin, no tale tells, for out  of the  Dark  Years  few tales  have come. But still she was  there, who  was  there  before Sauron, and before the first  stone of Barad-dyr; and she served none  but herself, drinking the blood of Elves and Men, bloated and grown fat with  endless  brooding on her  feasts,  weaving  webs of shadow;  for all  living  things  were  her  food,  and her  vomit  darkness.  Far and wide her lesser   broods, bastards  of the miserable mates, her own offspring,  that she slew,   spread from  glen to glen, from the Ephel D®ath to the eastern hills, to Dol  Guldur and the fastnesses of Mirkwood. But none could  rival her, Shelob the  Great, last child of Ungoliant to trouble the unhappy world."
