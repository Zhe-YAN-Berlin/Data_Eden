Many of them had indeed been ordered a year before,  and  had  come  all  the way  from  the Mountain and from Dale, and  were of real  dwarf-make.       When  every guest had been  welcomed  and was finally inside the  gate,    ####-there were  songs, dances, music, games,  and,  of course,  food  and drink.  There were  three  official  meals: lunch,  tea, and dinner (or supper). But  lunch and  tea were marked chiefly by  the fact that at  those times all the  guests  were sitting  down and eating together. At  other  times  there were  merely lots  of  people  eating and drinking  -  continuously from elevenses  until six-thirty, when the fireworks  started.       The fireworks were by Gandalf: they were not only brought  by  him, but  designed and made by  him; and the  special effects, set pieces, and flights  of rockets were let off by him. But  there was  also a generous distribution  of  squibs,  crackers,  backarappers,   sparklers,  torches,  dwarf-candles,   elf-fountains, goblin-barkers  and thunder -claps. They  were all superb. The  art of Gandalf improved with age.       There were  rockets like  a flight  of scintillating birds singing with  sweet voices. There were green trees with trunks of dark smoke: their leaves   opened like a whole spring unfolding in a moment, and their shining branches  dropped glowing flowers down upon the  astonished hobbits, disappearing with  a  sweet  scent just  before they touched  their  upturned faces. There were  fountains  of butterflies that flew  glittering into  the trees;  there were  pillars  of  coloured  fires that rose  and  turned into eagles, or  sailing  ships,  or  a  phalanx of flying swans; there was a red  thunderstorm  and a   shower  of  yellow  rain; there was a  forest  of silver spears  that sprang  suddenly  into the  air with a  yell like an embattled  army, and came  down  again into the Water with a hiss like a  hundred hot snakes.  And there  was  also one last surprise,  in  honour of Bilbo,  and  it startled  the hobbits  exceedingly, as  Gandalf intended. The lights went out. A great  smoke  went  up. It shaped itself like a mountain seen in the distance, and began to glow  at  the summit. It spouted green  and scarlet flames. Out flew a  red-golden  dragon - not life-size, but terribly life-like: fire came from his jaws, his  eyes glared down; there  was  a  roar, and he whizzed three  times  over the  heads of the crowd. They all ducked, and  many fell fla t on their faces. The  dragon passed like an  express train,  turned a  somersault, and  burst over   Bywater with a deafening explosion.       'That is  the  signal for  supper!'  said  Bilbo.  The  pain  and alarm  vanished at once, and the prostrate hobbits  leaped to their feet. There  was  a splendid supper for everyone; for everyone, that  is, except those invited  to the special family dinner -party. This was held in the great pavilion with  the tree. The invitations were limited to twelve dozen (a number also called   ####-by the hobbits one Gross, though  the  word was not considered proper to use  of people); and  the  guests were selected  from  all  the families to which  Bilbo and Frodo were related, with  the addition of a  few special unrelated  friends (such as Gandalf). Many young hobbits  were included, and present by  parental permission; for hobbits were easy-going with their children in  the  matter  of  sitting up late,  especially when there  was a chance of getting  them a free meal. Bringing up young hobbits took a lot of provender.       There  were  many  Bagginses  and  Boffins,  and also  many  Tooks  and  Brandybucks;  there  were  various  Grubbs   (relations  of  Bilbo  Baggins'  grandmother), and various Chubbs (connexions of his Took grandfather); and a  selection  of  Burrowses,  Bolgers, Bracegirdles,  Brockhouses,  Goodbodies,  Hornblowers and Proudfoots. Some of these were only very distantly  connected  with Bilbo, and  some of them  had hardly ever  been in Hobbiton before,  as  they lived in remote corners of the Shire. The Sackville-Bagginses  were not  forgotten.  Otho and his wife Lobelia were present. They disliked Bilbo  and  detested Frodo,  but  so magnificent  was the invitation  card,  written  in  golden ink, that  they had felt it was impossible to refuse. Besides,  their  cousin, Bilbo, had been specializing  in  food for many years and  his table  had a high reputation.       All  the  one hundred  and forty-four guests expected a pleasant feast;  though they  rather  dreaded  the  after -dinner  speech  of their  host  (an  inevitable item). He was liable to drag  in bits of  what he  called poetry;  and sometimes, after  a glass or two, would  allude to the absurd adventures  of his mysterious journey. The guests were not disappointed: they had a very  pleasant feast, in fact an engrossing entertainment: rich, abundant, varied,  and prolonged."
