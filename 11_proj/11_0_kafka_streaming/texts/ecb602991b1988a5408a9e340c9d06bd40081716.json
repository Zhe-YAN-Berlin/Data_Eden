Ser Rodrik cleared his throat and looked uncomfortable.   She was very sad,  said Bran.  Ser Rodrik nodded.  Sad and gentle, and not at all uncomely for a woman of her years, for all her modesty. Yet a danger to the peace of your brother’s realm nonetheless.    Her?  Bran said, astonished.  Maester Luwin answered.  With no direct heir, there are sure to be many claimants contending for the Hornwood lands. The Tallharts, Flints, and Karstarks all have ties to House Hornwood through the female line, and the Glovers are fostering Lord Harys’s bastard at Deepwood Motte. The Dreadfort has no claim that I know, but the lands adjoin, and Roose Bolton is not one to overlook such a chance.   Ser Rodrik tugged at his whiskers.  In such cases, her liege lord must find her a suitable match.    Why can’t you marry her?  Bran asked.  You said she was comely, and Beth would have a mother.   The old knight put a hand on Bran’s arm.  A kindly thought, my prince, but I am only a knight, and besides too old. I might hold her lands for a few years, but as soon as I died Lady Hornwood would find herself back in the same mire, and Beth’s prospects might be perilous as well.    Then let Lord Hornwood’s bastard be the heir,  Bran said, thinking of his half brother Jon.  Ser Rodrik said,  That would please the Glovers, and perhaps Lord Hornwood’s shade as well, but I do not think Lady Hornwood would love us. The boy is not of her blood.    Still,  said Maester Luwin,  it must be considered. Lady Donella is past her fertile years, as she said herself. If not the bastard, who?    May I be excused?  Bran could hear the squires at their swordplay in the yard below, the ring of steel on steel.   As you will, my prince,  said Ser Rodrik.  You did well.  Bran flushed with pleasure. Being a lord was not so tedious as he had feared, and since Lady Hornwood had been so much briefer than Lord Manderly, he even had a few hours of daylight left to visit with Summer. He liked to spend time with his wolf every day, when Ser Rodrik and the maester allowed it.  No sooner had Hodor entered the godswood than Summer emerged from under an oak, almost as if he had known they were coming. Bran glimpsed a lean black shape watching from the undergrowth as well.  Shaggy,  he called.  Here, Shaggydog. To me.  But Rickon’s wolf vanished as swiftly as he’d appeared.  Hodor knew Bran’s favorite place, so he took him to the edge of the pool beneath the great spread of the heart tree, where Lord Eddard used to kneel to pray. Ripples were running across the surface of the water when they arrived, making the reflection of the weirwood shimmer and dance. There was no wind, though. For an instant Bran was baffled.  And then Osha exploded up out of the pool with a great splash, so sudden that even Summer leapt back, snarling. Hodor jumped away, wailing  Hodor, Hodor  in dismay until Bran patted his shoulder to soothe his fears.  How can you swim in there?  he asked Osha.  Isn’t it cold?    As a babe I suckled on icicles, boy. I like the cold.  Osha swam to the rocks and rose dripping. She was naked, her skin bumpy with gooseprickles. Summer crept close and sniffed at her.  I wanted to touch the bottom.    I never knew there was a bottom.    Might be there isn’t.  She grinned.  What are you staring at, boy? Never seen a woman before?    I have so.  Bran had bathed with his sisters hundreds of times and he’d seen serving women in the hot pools too. Osha looked different, though, hard and sharp instead of soft and curvy. Her legs were all sinew, her breasts flat as two empty purses.  You’ve got a lot of scars.    Every one hard earned.  She picked up her brown shift, shook some leaves off of it, and pulled it down over her head.   Fighting giants?  Osha claimed there were still giants beyond the Wall. One day maybe I’ll even see one…   Fighting men.  She belted herself with a length of rope.  Black crows, oft as not. Killed me one too,  she said, shaking out her hair. It had grown since she’d come to Winterfell, well down past her ears. She looked softer than the woman who had once tried to rob and kill him in the wolfswood.  Heard some yattering in the kitchen today about you and them Freys.    Who? What did they say?   She gave him a sour grin.  That it’s a fool boy who mocks a giant, and a mad world when a cripple has to defend him.    Hodor never knew they were mocking him,  Bran said.  Anyhow he never fights.  He remembered once when he was little, going to the market square with his mother and Septa Mordane. They brought Hodor to carry for them, but he had wandered away, and when they found him some boys had him backed into an alley, poking him with sticks.  Hodor!  he kept shouting, cringing and covering himself, but he had never raised a hand against his tormentors.  Septon Chayle says he has a gentle spirit.    Aye,  she said,  and hands strong enough to twist a man’s head off his shoulders, if he takes a mind to."
