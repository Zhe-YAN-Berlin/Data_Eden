'No, not altogether wicked,' said Frodo.       'Not wholly, perhaps,' said Faramir; 'but malice eats it like a canker,  and the  evil is growing. He will lead you to no good. If you will part with  him, I will give him safe-conduct and guidance to  any  point on the borders  of Gondor that he may name.'       `He would not take  it,' said  Frodo.  'He would  follow after me as he  long  has  done.  And I  have  promised  many  times  to  take him under  my    ####-protection  and to go where he led. You would not ask me to break faith with  him?'       'No,'  said  Faramir. `But my  heart would. For it  seems less  evil to  counsel another man to break troth than to do so oneself, especially if  one  sees a friend bound unwitting to his own  harm. But no  -- if he will go with  you, you must  now endure him. But I do not think  you are  holden to go  to  Cirith  Ungol, of which  he has told you  less than  he  knows. That much  I  perceived clearly in his mind. Do not go to Cirith Ungol!'       `Where then shall  I  go?  ' said   Frodo.  `Back  to the Black Gate and  deliver  myself  up  to the guard? What do  you know against this place that  makes its name so dreadful? '       `Nothing certain,' said Faramir. 'We of Gondor do not ever pass east of  the Road in these days, and none of us younger men has ever done so, nor has  any  of us  set foot upon the  Mountains of Shadow. Of them we know only old  report and the  rumour of bygone  days. But there  is some  dark terror that  dwells in the  passes above Minas Morgul. If Cirith Ungol  is named, old men  and masters of lore will blanch and fall silent.       ,The valley  of Minas Morgul passed into evil very long ago, and it was  a menace  and  a  dread while the banished  Enemy dwelt  yet far  away,  and  Ithilien was still for the most par t in our keeping.  As you know, that city  was once a strong place, proud and fair, Minas Ithil, the twin sister of our  own city.  But it was taken by fell men whom the Enemy in his first strength  had dominated, and who wandered homeless and masterless  aft er his fall.  It  is said  that  their lords  were  men of  N®menor  who had fallen  into dark  wickedness; to them the Enemy had  given rings of power, and he had  devoured  them: living ghosts  they were become, terrible  and  evil. After  his going  they took Minas  Ithil and  dwelt  there,  and they  filled  it, and all the  valley about, with decay: it seemed empty  and was  not so,  for a shapeless  fear  lived  within the ruined walls. Nine Lords there  were, and after  the  return  of their Master, which they aided and prepared  in secret, they grew  strong again.  Then the Nine Riders issued forth from  the  gates of horror,  and we could not withstand them. Do not approach their  citadel. You will be  espied. It  is a place of  sleepless malice, full of lidless eyes. Do not go  that way!  '       'But where else will you direct me? ' said Frodo. 'You cannot yourself,   you say, guide me to the mountains, nor over  them. But over the mountains I   ####-am bound, by solemn  undertaking to the  Council, to find a way or perish in  the seeking. And if  I turn back, refusing the road in its bitter end, where  then  shall I go  among Elves or Men? Would you have  me come to Gondor  with  this Thing, the Thing  that drove your  brother mad with  desire? What spell   would it work in Minas Tirith?  Shall  there be two  cities of Minas Morgul,   grinning at each other across a dead land filled with rottenness? '       `I would not have it so,' said Faramir.       `Then what would you have me do? '       `I know not. Only I would not have you go to death or to torment. And I  do not think that Mithrandir would have chosen this way.'       'Yet since he is gone, I must take such paths as I can find.  And there  is no time for long searching,' said Frodo.       `It is a hard doom and a hopeless errand,'  said  Faramir.  'But at the  least,  remember my  warning:  beware  of this guide,  Smjagol.  He has done  murder before now. I read it in him.' He sighed.       `Well, so we meet and  part,  Frodo son of Drogo. You have no  need  of  soft words: I do  not hope to see you again on any other day under this Sun.  But you shall go  now with my blessing upon you,  and upon  all your people.  Rest a little while food is prepared for you.       'I would gladly learn how this creeping Smjagol became possessed of the  Thing of which we speak, and how he lost it, but I will not trouble you now.   If ever beyond  hope you return to the lands of the living and we retell our  tales, sitting by a wall in the sun, laughing at  old  grief, you shall tell  me  then.  Until  that  time, or some  other time beyond the vision  of  the  Seeing-stones of N®menor, farewell! '       He rose and bowed low to Frodo, and drawing the curtain passed out into  the cave."
