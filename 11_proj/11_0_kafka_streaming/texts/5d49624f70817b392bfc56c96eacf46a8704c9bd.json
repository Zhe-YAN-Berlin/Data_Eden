The strength was  enough  -  barely . '       He drew a deep breath. 'It was  a bitter struggle, and the weariness is  slow to pass. I spoke no word to him, and in the end I wrenched the Stone to  my own  will. That alone he will find hard to endure. And he beheld me. Yes,   Master Gimli, he saw me, but in other guise than you  see  me here. If  that  will aid him, then I  have  done ill. But I do not think so. To  know that I  lived  and walked the earth was a blow  to his heart, I deem; for he knew it  not till now. The eyes in Orthanc did not see through the armour of Thjoden;   but Sauron has not  forgotten Isildur and the  sword of  Elendil. Now in the  very  hour  of  his  great  designs the  heir of  Isildur and the  Sword are  revealed; for l showed the blade re-forged  to him. He is not so mighty   yet  that he is above fear; nay, doubt ever gnaws him.'       'But he wields  great dominion, nonetheless,' said Gimli;  'and now  he  will strike more swiftly.'       'The hasty  stroke  goes oft astray,' said Aragorn. 'We must press  our  Enemy, and no longer wait upon him  for the move. See my friends, when I had  mastered  the  Stone,  I  learned many things.  A grave peril I  saw  coming  unlooked-for upon Gondor  from the  South that will  draw off great strength  from the defence of Minas Tirith. If  it  is not countered  swiftly,  I deem  that the City will be lost ere ten days be gone.'       'Then lost it must be,'  said Gimli. 'For  what  help is  there to send  thither, and how could it come there in time?'       'I have  no help  to send,  therefore I must  go myself,'  said Aragorn.  'But there is only one way through the mountains  that will  bring me to the  coastlands before all is lost. That is the Paths of the Dead.'       'The Paths of the Dead!' said Gimli.  'It is a fell name; and little to  the liking to the Men of Rohan, as I saw. Can the living use such a road and   not perish? And even if you pass that way, what will so few avail to counter   the strokes of Mordor?'   ####-     'The  living  have  never  used that  road  since  the  coming  of  the  Rohirrim,' said Aragorn, 'for it is closed to  them.  But  in this dark hour  the heir of Isildur may use  it, if he  dare. Listen! This is the word  that  the sons of  Elrond bring  to  me  from their father in Rivendell, wisest in  lore: Bid  Aragorn remember  the words  of the  seer,  and the Paths of  the  Dead.'       'And what may be the words of the seer?' said Legolas.        \"Thus spoke  Malbeth the  Seer,  in the days of  Arvedui,  last king at  Fornost,' said Aragorn:       Over the land there lies a long shadow,        westward reaching wings of darkness.       The Tower trembles; to the tombs of kings       doom approaches. The Dead awaken;       for the hour is come for the oathbreakers;       at the Stone of Erech they shall stand again        and hear there a horn in the hills ringing.       Whose shall the horn be? Who shall call them       from the prey twilight, the forgotten people?       The heir of him to whom the oath they swore.       From the North shall he come, need shall drive him:       he shall pass the Door to the Paths of the Dead.       'Dark ways doubtless, said  Gimli, but no darker than these staves  are  to me.'       'If you  would  understand them better, then I bid  you  come with me,'  said Aragorn; 'for that way I now shall take. But I do  not go  gladly; only  need drives me. Therefore, only of your free will would I have you come, for  you will find both toil and great fear, and maybe worse.'       'I will go with you even on the Paths of the Dead, and to whatever, end  they may lead,' said Gimli.       'I also will come,' said Legolas, 'for I do not fear the Dead.'       'I  hope  that the  forgotten people  will  not have  forgotten how  to  fight,' said Gimli; 'for otherwise I see not why we should trouble them.'       'That we shall know if ever  we come to Erech,' said  Aragorn. 'But the  oath  that  they broke  was  to  fight  against Sauron, and they must  fight  therefore,  if  they are to fulfil it. For at Erech there stands yet a black   stone that was brought, it was said, from NÂ®menor by Isildur; and it was set  upon a hill, and  upon it  the King of the Mountains swore allegiance to him   ####-in  the beginning of the realm of Gondor. But when Sauron returned and  grew  in might again, Isildur summoned the  Men of  the Mountains to  fulfil their  oath, and they would not: for they had worshipped Sauron in the Dark Years.       'Then Isildur said to  their king: \"Thou shalt be the last king. And if  the West prove mightier than thy  Black Master, this curse  I  lay upon thee  and thy folk: to rest never until your oath is  fulfilled. For this war will  last through years uncounted, and you  shall be summoned once again ere  the  end."
