'And  anyway all these notions  are only a trick,' he said  to himself.  'He'd spot me and cow me, before I could so much as shou t out. He'd spot me,  pretty  quick, if I put the Ring  on now, in Mordor. Well, all I can say is:   things look  as hopeless  as  a frost in spring.  Just when being  invisible  would be really useful, I can't use the Ring! And if ever I get any further,  it's going to be nothing but a drag and a burden every step. So what's to be  done?'       He was not  really  in any doubt. He knew  that he must go  down to the  gate and not linger any more. With a shrug of his shoulders,  as if to shake  off the shadow and dismiss  the phantoms, he began  slowly  to descend. With  each  step he seemed to  diminish. He had not gone far  before he had shrunk  again to a  very small and  frightened hobbit. He was now  passing under the   very walls of the Tower, and the cries and sounds of fighting could be heard  with his unaided ears. At the moment the  noise seemed to be coming from the  court behind the outer wall.         Sam was about half way down the path when out of the dark gateway  into  the red  glow there  came two orcs running . They  did not turn towards  him.  They were  making for the main road; but  even as they ran they stumbled and  fell  to the ground  and lay still.  Sam had seen no  arrows, but he guessed  that the orcs had  been shot down by others on  the battlements or hidden in  the shadow of the gate. He  went on, hugging  the wall on his left. One look   upward had  shown him that there was no hope of  climbing it. The stone-work  rose  thirty  feet, without  a crack  or ledge, to  overhanging courses like  inverted steps. The gate was the only way.       He crept on;  and  as he went  he wondered how many  orcs lived  in the  Tower with Shagrat, and how many Gorbag had, and what they  were  quarrelling  about, if  that was  what was  happening. Shagrat's company had seemed to be  about forty, and  Gorbag's more than twice as large; but of course Shagrat's  patrol  had  only been a part of his  garrison. Almost  certainly  they were  quarrelling  about  Frodo,  and the  spoil.  For  a second  Sam  halted, for  suddenly things seemed clear to him, almost as if he had seen them with  his   ####-eyes. The mithril coat! Of course, Frodo was wearing it, and they would find  it. And from what Sam had heard Gorbag would covet it. But the orders of the  Dark  Tower  were at present Frodo's  only  protection, and if they were set  aside, Frodo might be killed out of hand at any moment.       'Come on, you miserable sluggard!' Sam cried to  himself. `Now for it!'  He drew Sting and ran towards the  open gate. But  just as he was  about  to  pass under its great arch he felt a  shock: as if  he had run into some  web  like Shelob's, only invisible. He could see no obstacle,  but  something too  strong for his will to  overcome barred  the way. He  looked about, and then   within the shadow of the gate he saw the Two Watchers.       They were like great figures seated upon thrones. Each had three joined  bodies,  and three heads facing outward, and inward, and across the gateway.  The  heads had vulture-faces, and on  their  great knees were  laid clawlike  hands. They seemed to be carved out of huge blocks  of stone, immovable, and  yet they were aware: some dreadful  spirit of evil vigilance  abode in them.  They knew  an  enemy.  Visible or  invisible none  could pass unheeded. They  would forbid his entry, or his escape.       Hardening his  will  Sam thrust forward once again, and  halted  with a   jerk, staggering  as if from a blow  upon his  breast and head. Then greatly  daring, because he could  think  of nothing  else to do, answering  a sudden  thought that came to him, he drew slowly out the phial of Galadriel and held  it up.  Its white light quickened swiftly, and  the shadows under  the  dark  arch fled. The monstrous Watchers sat there cold and still, revealed  in all  their hideous shape. For a moment  Sam caught a  glitter in  the black stones   of their  eyes, the very malice of which made  him quail; but slowly he felt  their will waver and crumble into fear.       He sprang past them; but even as he  did so, thrusting the  phial  back   into his bosom, he was aware, as plainly as if a bar of steel had snapped to  behind  him,  that their vigilance was  renewed. And  from  those evil heads  there came  a high shrill cry that echoed  in the towering walls before him.  Far up above,  like  an answering signal,  a  harsh bell  clanged  a  single  stroke.         'That's done it!'  said Sam. `Now I've rung  the front-door bell! Well,  come   on  somebody!'  he  cried.  `Tell  Captain  Shagrat  that  the  great  Elf-warrior has called, with his elf-sword too!'       There  was no answer. Sam  strode forward."
