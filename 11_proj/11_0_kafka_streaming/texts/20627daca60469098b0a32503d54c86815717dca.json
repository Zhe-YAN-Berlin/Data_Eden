Ahead of them  there was a bay in the  valley-side, and  round the  head of this  the path  went on, no more than a   wide ledge with a chasm on the right; across the sheer southward face of the  mountain it crawled upwards, until it disappeared into the blackness above.       `I  must rest a  while, Sam,' whispered Frodo. `It's heavy  on me,  Sam  lad, very heavy. I wonder how far I can carry  it? Anyway I must rest before  we venture on to that.' He pointed to the narrow way ahead.       `Sssh! ssh! ' hissed Gollum hurrying back to them. `Sssh! ' His fingers  were on his lips and he shook his head urgently. Tugging  at Frodo's sleeve,   he pointed towards the path; but Frodo would not move.       `Not  yet,' he  said,  'not  yet.' Weariness and  more  than  weariness  oppressed him; it seemed as if a heavy spell was laid on his mind  and body.  `I must rest,' he muttered.       At  this  Gollum's fear  and  agitation became so  great that he  spoke  again,  hissing  behind  his hand, as  if to  keep  the  sound  from  unseen  listeners  in the air. `Not here, no. Not rest here. Fools! Eyes can see us.  When they come  to the  bridge they will see  us. Come away!  Climb,  climb!   Come!  '       `Come, Mr. Frodo,' said Sam. `He's right, again. We can't stay here.'       'All  right,'  said Frodo  in a  remote voice, as of one  speaking half  asleep. `I will try.' Wearily he got to his feet.       But  it  was too  late.  At that moment the rock quivered  and trembled  beneath them. The  great rumbling noise, louder than ever before, rolled  in  the ground and echoed in the mountains.  Then  with searing suddenness there  came a great red flash. Far beyond the eastern  mountains it leapt into  the   ####-sky and splashed the lowering clouds with cr imson.  In that valley of shadow  and  cold deathly light it  seemed  unbearably violent  and fierce. Peaks of  stone and ridges like notched knives sprang out in staring black against the  uprushing flame in Gorgoroth. Then came a great crack of thunder.       And Minas Morgul answered. There was a flare of livid lightnings: forks  of blue flame springing up from the tower and from the encircling hills into  the sullen clouds. The earth groaned; and out of the city there came  a cry.  Mingled  with harsh high voices as of birds of prey, and the shrill neighing  of horses wild with rage  and fear, there came a rending screech, shivering,  rising swiftly to a piercing pitch beyond the range of hearing.  The hobbits  wheeled round towards it, and cast themselves down, holding their hands upon  their ears.       As the terrible cry ended, falling back  through a long sickening  wail  to  silence, Frodo slowly  raised his head.  Across the  narrow  valley, now  almost on  a level with his eyes, the walls of the evil city stood ,  and its  cavernous  gate, shaped like an open mouth with gleaming  teeth,  was gaping  wide. And out of the gate an army came.       All that  host  was clad in  sable, dark  as the night. Against the wan  walls and  the luminous pavement  of  the  road Frodo could  see them, small  black figures in rank upon rank,  marching  swiftly  and  silently,  passing  outwards in  an endless stream. Before them went a great cavalry of horsemen  moving like  ordered shadows, and at their head was one greater than all the  rest: a Rider, all black, save that on his  hooded head he had a helm like a   crown that  flickered with  a  perilous  light.  Now he was drawing near the  bridge below,  and Frodo's staring eyes followed him,  unable to  wink or to  withdraw. Surely there was the Lord of the  Nine Riders returned to earth to  lead his ghastly  host to battle? Here, yes here indeed was the haggard king  whose cold  hand had smitten down the Ring-bearer with his deadly knife. The  old wound throbbed with pain and a great chill spread towards Frodo's heart.       Even  as these thoughts  pierced him with dread  and held him  bound as  with a  spell, the Rider halted suddenly, right  before the  entrance of the  bridge, and behind him all the host stood still. There was  a pause, a  dead  silence. Maybe it was  the Ring that called  to the  Wraith-lord, and for  a   moment he was troubled, sensing some other power within his valley. This way  and that turned the dark head helmed  and  crowned  with  fear, sweeping the  shadows with its unseen eyes. Frodo waited, like a bird at the approach of a   snake,  unable to move.  And  as  he  waited, he felt, more urgent than ever    ####-before,  the command  that  he  should  put on  the Ring.  But great as  the  pressure was, he felt no  inclination now to yield to it. He  knew that  the  Ring would only betray him, and that he had not, even if  he  put it on, the  power  to face the  Morgul-king-not yet. There was no  longer any  answer to  that command in his own will,  dismayed by terror though it was, and he  felt  only the  beating upon him of a  great power from outside."
