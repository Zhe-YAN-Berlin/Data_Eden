He  will  not go astray-if   ####-there is any path to find. He has  led us in here  against our fears, but he  will lead us out again, at whatever cost to himself. He is  surer of finding  the way home in a blind night than the cats of Queen BerÂ®thiel.'       It was well for  the Company that  they  had such  a guide. They had no  fuel nor any means of making torches; in the desperate scramble at the doors  many things had been left behind. But without any light they would soon have  come  to grief. There  were not only  many roads  to choose from, there were  also  in many places holes and pitfalls, and dark wells beside  the  path in  which their passing feet echoed. There were fissures and chasms in the walls  and floor, and  every  now  and  then  a crack would open right before their  feet.  The widest was more than seven  feet across, and it  was long  before  Pippin could summon enough courage to leap over the dreadful gap.  The noise  of churning water came  up from  far below, as if  some great mill-wheel was  turning in the depths.        `Rope! ' muttered Sam. `I knew I'd want it, if I hadn't got it! '       As  these  dangers  became  more frequent  their  march became  slower.   Already  they  seemed  to  have  been  tramping  on, on,  endlessly  to  the  mountains' roots. They were more than weary, and yet there seemed no comfort  in  the thought of halting anywhere. Frodo's  spirits had risen  for a while  after his escape, and  after food and a draught  of the  cordial; but  now a   deep uneasiness, growing to  dread, crept over him again. Though he had been  healed  in  Rivendell  of the  knife-stroke,  that grim  wound had  not been  without effect. His senses were sharper and more aware  of things that could  not be seen. One sign of change that he soon had noticed  was that he  could  see more in the  dark  than any of his companions, save perhaps Gandalf. And  he was  in any case  the bearer of the Ring: it hung upon its chain  against  his breast, and at whiles it seemed a heavy weight. He felt the certainty of  evil ahead and of evil following; but he said nothing. He gripped tighter on  the hilt of his sword and went on doggedly.       The Company behind him spoke seldom, and then only in hurried whispers.   There  was  no  sound  but  the  sound of  their own feet; the dull stump of  Gimli's dwarf-boots; the heavy tread of Boromir; the  light step of Legolas;  the soft, scarce-heard patter of hobbit-feet; and in the rear  the slow firm  footfalls of  Aragorn with his  long stride.  When they halted  for a moment  they  heard nothing  at all, unless it were occasionally a faint trickle and  drip of unseen water. Yet Frodo began to hear, or to imagine  that he heard,  something else:  like the faint  fall of soft bare feet. It  was  never loud   ####-enough, or near  enough, for him to  feel certain that he heard it; but once  it had started it never stopped, while  the Company was moving. But  it  was  not an echo, for when they halted it pattered on for a little all by itself,   and then grew still.       It was after nightfall when they had  entered the  Mines. They had been  going for several hours with only  brief  halts,  when Gandalf came  to  his  first serious check.  Before  him stood a wide dark arch  opening into three  passages: all  led  in  the  same  general  direction,  eastwards;  but  the  left -hand  passage plunged  down, while the right-hand climbed up,  and  the   middle way seemed to run on, smooth and level but very narrow.       'I  have no  memory of this  place  at all! '  said  Gandalf,  standing  uncertainly under the arch. He held up his staff in the hope of finding some  marks or inscription that might help his choice; but nothing of the kind was  to be seen. `I am too  weary to decide,'  he said, shaking his head. `And  I  expect  that you are all as weary  as I  am, or wearier.  We had better halt  here for what is left of the night. You know what I mean! In here it is ever   dark; but outside the late Moon is riding westward and  the middle-night has  passed.'       `Poor old Bill! ' said Sam. 'I wonder where he is. I hope  those wolves  haven't got him yet.'       To the  left of  the great arch  they  found a stone door:  it was half  closed, but swung back easily to a gentle thrust. Beyond there seemed to lie  a wide chamber cut in the rock.       `Steady! Steady!  ' cried  Gandalf as Merry and  Pippin pushed forward,  glad to find a place where  they could  rest  with  at least more feeling of  shelter than  in  the open passage. `Steady! You do  not know what is inside   yet. I will go first.'       He went in cautiously, and the others filed behind. `There! '  he said,  pointing with his staff to the middle of the floor. Before his feet they saw  a large round hole like the  mouth of a well."
