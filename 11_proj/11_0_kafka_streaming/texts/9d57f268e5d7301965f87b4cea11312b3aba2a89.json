The water was  gathered  again into  a   stone basin in the floor between the trees, and thence it spilled and flowed  away beside the open path, out  to rejoin the Entwash in its journey through  the forest.       'Hm! Here we are!' said Treebeard, breaking his  long silence.  'I have  brought you about  seventy  thousand  ent-strides, but what that comes to in  the measurement of your land I do not know. Anyhow we are near the roots  of  the  Last Mountain.  Part of the name of this place might be Wellinghall, if  it were turned into your language. I like it. We will stay here tonight.' He  set them  down  on  the  grass  between  the aisles  of the  trees, and they  followed  him  towards the great arch. The  hobbits  now  noticed that as he  walked his  knees  hardly bent, but  his  legs opened in  a great stride. He  planted  his big toes (and they  were indeed  big, and very  broad)  on  the  ground first, before any other part of his feet.       For a moment Treebeard stood under the rain of the falling  spring, and  took a deep breath;  then he laughed, and passed inside. A great stone table  stood there, but  no chairs. At  the back of the  bay  it was already  quite  dark. Treebeard lifted two  great  vessels and stood them on the table. They  seemed to  be  filled with water;  but he  held  his  hands over  them,  and  immediately they began to glow,  one with a golden and the other with a rich  green light; and  the blending of the two lights lit the bay; as  if the sun  of  summer  was  shining through a roof of young  leaves. Looking back,  the  hobbits saw that the trees in  the court had also begun to glow,  faintly at  first, but steadily quickening, until  every leaf was edged with light: some  green,  some gold, some red as  copper; while  the  tree-trunks  looked like  pillars moulded out of luminous stone.       'Well, well, now we can talk again,' said Treebeard. 'You are thirsty I  expect. Perhaps you are also tired. Drink this!' He went to the  back of the  bay, and  then they saw that several tall stone jars stood there, with heavy  lids. He removed  one of the lids, and dipped  in a great ladle, and with it  filled three bowls, one very large bowl, and two smaller ones.        'This is an ent-house,' he said, 'and there are no seats, I  fear.  But  you may sit on the table.'  Picking  up the hobbits he set them on the great  stone  slab, six feet  above the  ground, and there they  sat dangling their  legs, and drinking in sips.   ####-     The  drink was  like water, indeed very like  the taste of the draughts  they had drunk from the  Entwash near, the borders  of the  forest,  and yet  there was  some scent or savour in  it which they could not describe: it was  faint, but it reminded them of  the smell of a distant wood borne  from afar  by a cool breeze at night. The effect of the  draught began at the toes, and  rose  steadily  through every limb, bringing  refreshment  and vigour  as it  coursed upwards, right to the tips of the hair. Indeed the hobbits felt that  the  hair  on  their heads was actually standing up,  waving and curling and  growing. As for Treebeard, he first laved his feet  in the basin beyond  the  arch, and then he  drained his bowl at one draught, one long, slow  draught.  The hobbits thought he would never stop.       At last he  set the bowl down again. 'Ah -- ah,' he sighed. 'Hm,  hoom,  now we can talk easier. You can sit on the floor, and  I will lie down; that  will prevent this drink from rising to my head and sending me to sleep.'       On the right side of  the  bay there  was a great bed on low legs;  not  more than a couple of feet high,  covered  deep in dried grass  and bracken.  Treebeard lowered himself slowly on to this (with only the slightest sign of  bending at his  middle),  until he lay at full  length, with his arms behind  his head, looking up at the ceiling. upon which lights were flickering, like  the  play of leaves  in the sunshine. Merry  and Pippin  sat  beside him  on  pillows of grass.        'Now tell me your tale, and do not hurry!' said Treebeard.       The hobbits began to tell him the story of their  adventures ever since  they left Hobbiton. They followed  no very clear order, for they interrupted  one another continually, and Treebeard often stopped the  speaker, and  went  back to some earlier point, or  jumped forward asking questions  about later   events. They said  nothing whatever about the Ring, and did not tell him why  they set  out or  where they  were going to;  and he  did not  ask  for  any  reasons.        He  was  immensely interested in  everything: in  the  Black Riders, in  Elrond, and Rivendell, in the Old Forest, and  Tom Bombadil, in the Mines of  Moria, and in Lothlurien  and Galadriel."
