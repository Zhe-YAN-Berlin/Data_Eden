  "text": " Also Gildor advised me  not to wait. But I  should  very  much like  to see  Gandalf. I could see that even Gildor was disturbed  when  he heard that Gandalf  had never  appeared. It really  depends  on two  things.  How soon could the Riders get to Bucklebury? And how  soon could  we  get off? It will take a good deal of preparation.'       'The answer to the  second question,' said Merry, 'is that we could get  off in an hour. I have prepared practically everything. There are six ponies  in a stable across the fields; stores and tackle are all packed, except  for   a few extra clothes, and the perishable food.'       'It seems to have been  a  very efficient conspiracy,' said Frodo. 'But  what about the Black Riders? Would it be safe to wait one day for Gandalf?'       'That all depends on  what you think the Riders would do, if they found  you here,' answered Merry. 'They could  have reached here  by now, of course,  if they were not stopped at the North-gate, where the Hedge runs down to the  river -bank, just this side of the Bridge. The gate-guards would not let them   ####-through by night, though they might break through. Even in the daylight they  would try  to keep them out, I think, at any  rate until  they got a message  through to the Master of the Hall  - for they would not like the  look of the  Riders, and would certainly be  frightened by them. But, of course, Buckland  cannot resist a determined attack for  long. And it  is possible that in the  morning even a Black Rider that rode  up  and asked for Mr. Baggins would be  let through. It is pretty generally known that you are coming back  to  live  at Crickhollow.'       Frodo  sat for  a while in thought. 'I have made  up  my mind,' he said  finally. 'I am starting tomorrow, as soon as it is light. But I am not going  by road: it  would be safer  to  wait here than  that.  If  I go through the  North-gate my departure from  Buckland  will  be  known at once, instead  of  being secret for  several days at least,  as it might be. And  what is more,  the Bridge and the  East Road  near the  borders  will certainly be watched,  whether  any Rider gets into  Buckland or not. We don't know  how many there  are; but there are at least  two, and possibly more. The only thing to do is  to go off in a qu ite unexpected direction.'       'But that  can only mean going  into  the  Old  Forest!'  said Fredegar  horrified. 'You can't be thinking of doing that. It is quite as dangerous as  Black Riders.'       'Not quite,' said Merry. It sounds very  desperate, but I believe Frodo  is right. It is the only way of getting off without being followed  at once.  With luck we might gel a considerable start.'       'But you won't have any luck in the Old Forest,' objected Fredegar. 'No  one ever has luck in there. You'll gel lost. People don't go in there.'       'Oh yes they  do!'  said  Merry. 'The Brandybucks go in   - occasionally  when the fit takes  them. We have  a  private entrance. Frodo  went in once,  long ago. I have been in several times: usually in daylight, of course, when  the trees are sleepy and fairly quiet.'       'Well, do  as you think best!' said Fredegar. 'I am more afraid of  the  Old  Forest  than of anything I  know about:  the  stories  about  it  are a   nightmare; but  my  vote hardly counts,  as I am  not going on the  journey.  Still, I am very glad  someone is stopping behind, who can tell Gandalf what  you have done, when he turns up, as I am sure he will before long.'       Fond as he was of Frodo, Fatty Bolger had no desire to leave the Shire,  nor to see what lay  outside it. His family came from the Eastfarthing, from  Budgeford in Bridgefields in fact, but he had never been over the Brandywine   ####-Bridge.  His task, according to the original plans  of the conspirators, was  to stay  behind and deal with inquisitive folk,  and  to keep up as long  as  possible the  pretence that Mr. Baggins  was still living at Crickhollow. He  had even brought along some old clothes of  Frodo's to help  him  in playing   the part. They little thought how dangerous that part might prove.       'Excellent!' said Frodo,  when he understood the  plan. 'We  could  not   have  left  any  message behind for Gandalf otherwise.  I don't know whether  these Riders can read or not, of course, but I should not have dared to risk   a written message, in case they got in and  searched the house. But if Fatty  is willing to hold the fort, and I can be sure of Gandalf knowing the way we  have gone, that  decides me. I am going  into  the Old  Forest  first  thing  tomorrow.'       'Well, that's that,' said Pippin. 'On the whole I would rather have our  job than Fatty's - waiting here till Black Riders come.'       'You wait till you are well inside  the Forest,' said Fredegar. 'You'll  wish you were back here with me before this time tomorrow.'       'It's no  good arguing about it any more,' said Merry.  'We have  still  got  to tidy up and put the finishing touches to  the packing, before we get  to bed."
