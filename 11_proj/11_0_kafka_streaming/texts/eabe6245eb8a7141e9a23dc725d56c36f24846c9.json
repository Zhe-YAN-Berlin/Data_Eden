My  lord does not   issue any command  to  you, he begs  you only to remember old friendship and  oaths  long spoken, and  for your  own  good to do  all that you may. It  is  reported to us that many kings have ridden in from the  East  to the service  of Mordor. From the  North to  the field  of Dagorlad there is skirmish  and  rumour of war. In the  South the Haradrim are moving, and fear has fallen on  all our  coastlands, so that little help will come to us thence. Make haste!  For it is before the walls of Minas Tirith that the doom of our time will be  decided,  and if the tide be not stemmed there, then  it will flow  over all  the fair fields of Rohan, and even in this Hold among the hills  there shall  be no refuge.'       'Dark  tidings,'  said Thjoden,  'yet  not  all  unguessed. But say  to  Denethor that even if Rohan itself felt no peril, still we would come to his  aid. But we have suffered much loss in our battles with Saruman the traitor,  and we must  still  think of our frontier to the  north and east, as his own  tidings make  clear.  So great a power as the  Dark Lord seems  now to wield  might well  contain us in  battle before the City and yet  strike with great  force across the River away beyond the Gate of Kings.       'But  we  will  speak no longer counsels of prudence. We will come. The  weapontake was set for the morrow.  When all is ordered we will set out. Ten  thousand spears I might  have sent  riding over  the plain to the dismay  of  your foes. It will be less  now, I fear; for I will not leave my strongholds  all unguarded. Yet six thousands at the  least shall ride behind me. For say  to Denethor that in this hour the King of the Mark himself will come down to  the land  of Gondor, though  maybe  he will not ride back. But it is a  long  road, and man and beast must reach the end with strength to fight. A week it  may be from tomorrow's morn  ere you hear the cry of the Sons of Eorl coming  from the North.       'A week!' said Hirgon. 'If it must be so, it must. But you are like  to  find  only  ruined  walls  in  seven  days  from  now,   unless  other  help  unlooked-for comes. Still, you may at the least disturb the Orcs and Swarthy  Men from their feasting in the White Tower.'   ####-     'At the least we will do that,' said Thjoden. 'But I myself am new-come  from  battle and long  journey, and I will  now go to rest. Tarry here  this  night. Then you shall  look on the muster of Rohan and ride away the gladder  for  the sight, and the swifter for the  rest.  In the morning counsels  are  best, and night changes many thoughts.        With  that the king stood up, and they all rose.  'Go  now each to your  rest.'  he said, 'and  sleep well. And you, Master Meriadoc, I  need no more  tonight. But be ready to my call as soon as the Sun is risen.'       'I will be ready,' said Merry, 'even if you bid me ride with you on the  Paths of the Dead.'       'Speak not words  of omen!' said the k ing. 'For there may be more roads  than one that could  bear  that name. But I did not say that I would bid you   ride with me on any road. Good night!'       'I won't be left behind,  to be called for on return!'  said  Merry. 'I   won't be  left, I won't.' And repeating this over and  over again to himself  he fell asleep at last in his tent.       He  was  wakened by  a  man  shaking him.  'Wake up,  wake  up.  Master  Holbytla!' he cried; and at length Merry came out of  deep dreams and sat up  with a start. It still seemed very dark, he thought.       'What is the matter?' he asked.       'The king calls for you.'       'But the Sun has not risen, yet,' said Merry.       'No, and will not rise  today,  Master Holbytla. Nor  ever  again,  one  would think under this cloud. But time  does not stand still, though the Sun  be lost. Make haste!'       Flinging on some clothes, Merry looked outside. The world was darkling.  The very air seemed brown, and  all things  about were  black  and grey  and  shadowless; there was  a great stillness. No shape  of cloud could be  seen,  unless it were far away  westward, where the furthest groping fingers of the  great gloom  still crawled  onwards  and a little light leaked through them.  Overhead there hung a heavy  roof, sombre and  featureless, and light seemed  rather to be failing than growing.       Merry saw many folk standing, looking up and muttering: all their faces  were grey and sad, and some  were afraid. With a sinking heart  he made  his  way to the king. Hirgon the rider of Gondor  was there before him, and beside  him  stood now another man, like  him and  dressed alike,  but  shorter  and  broader. As Merry entered he was speaking to the king.   ####-     'It comes from Mordor,  lord,' he said. 'It began last night at sunset.  From the hills in the Eastfold of your realm I saw it rise  and creep across  the sky, and all night as I rode it came behind eating up the stars. Now the  great cloud hangs  over all  the  land between  here  and  the Mountains  of  Shadow; and it is deepening."
