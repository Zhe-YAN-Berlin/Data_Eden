The  hosts  of Isengard roared, swaying this way and that, turning from  fear to fear. Again the horn sounded from the tower. Down through the breach  of  the  Dike  charged  the  king's  company.  Down  from  the hills  leaped   ####-Erkenbrand, lord  of Westfold. Down leaped Shadowfax, like a  deer that runs  surefooted  in  the mountains. The White Rider was upon them, and the terror   of  his coming filled  the enemy with  madness. The  wild men fell on  their  faces before him. The Orcs reeled and screamed and cast aside both sword and  spear. Like  a black smoke driven by a mounting wind they fled. Wailing they  passed under the waiting shadow of the trees; and from that shadow none ever   came again.     ####-   Chapter 8. The Road to Isengard            So it was that in the  light of a fair morning King Thjoden and Gandalf  the White Rider met again  upon the green  grass beside the  Deeping -stream.  There was also Aragorn son of Arathorn, and Legolas  the Elf, and Erkenbrand  of Westfold, and the lords of the Golden House. About them were gathered the  Rohirrim, the Riders of  the Mark: wonder overcame their joy in victory, and  their eyes were turned towards the wood.       Suddenly there was a great shout, and down from the Dike came those who  had been driven back into the  Deep. There came  Gamling  the Old, and Jomer   son of Jomund, and  beside them walked Gimli the dwarf. He had  no helm,  and  about his head was a linen band stained  with blood; but his voice  was loud  and strong.       'Forty-two,  Master Legolas!' he cried. 'Alas! My  axe is  notched: the  forty-second had an iron collar on his neck. How is it with you?'       'You have passed my  score  by  one,' answered Legolas. 'But  I  do not   grudge you the game, so glad am I to see you on your legs!'       'Welcome, Jomer, sister -son!' said Thjoden. 'Now that I see you safe, I  am glad indeed.'       'Hail, Lord  of the Mark!' said Jomer. 'The dark night has  passed  and  day has come again. But  the day has brought strange tidings.' He turned and  gazed in wonder, first at the  wood and then at Gandalf. 'Once more you come  in the hour of need, unlooked-for,' he said.       'Unlooked-for?' said Gandalf. 'I said that I would return and  meet you   here.'       'But you did not name the hour, nor foretell the manner of your coming.  Strange help you bring. You are mighty in wizardry, Gandalf the White!'       'That may be. But if so, I have not shown it yet. I have but given good  counsel in peril, and made  use of the  speed of Shadowfax. Your  own valour  has done more, and  the stout legs of the Westfold-men  marching through the  night.'       Then  they all gazed  at Gandalf with still greater wonder. Some glanced  darkly  at the wood,  and  passed their  hands  over their brows, as if they  thought their eyes saw otherwise than his.    ####-     Gandalf laughed long and merrily. 'The trees?' he said. 'Nay, I see the  wood as plainly as do you. But that is no deed of mine. It is a thing beyond  the counsel of the wise. Better than my design, and better even than my hope  the event has proved.'       'Then  if  not  yours,  whose  is  the  wizardry?'  said Thjoden.   'Not  Saruman's, that is plain. Is there some mightier sage, of  whom  we have yet  to learn?'       'It is  not  wizardry, but a power far older,' said  Gandalf:  'a power   that walked the earth, ere elf sang or hammer rang.       Ere iron was found or tree was hewn,       When young was mountain under moon;       Ere ring was made, or wrought was woe,       It walked the forests long ago.'       'And what may be the answer to your riddle?' said Thjoden.       'If you  would  learn  that,  you  should come  with me  to  Isengard '  answered Gandalf.        'To Isengard?' they cried.       'Yes,'  said Gandalf. 'I shall  return to  Isengard, and those who will  may come with me. There we may see strange things.'       'But  there  are  not men  enough  in  the Mark,  not if  they were all  gathered  together and  healed  of  wounds  and  weariness, to  assault  the  stronghold of Saruman,' said Thjoden.       'Nevertheless  to Isengard I go,' said Gandalf. 'I shall not stay there  long. My way lies now eastward. Look for me in Edoras, ere the waning of the  moon!'       'Nay!' said Thjoden.  'In  the dark hour  before dawn I doubted, but we  will not part now. I will come with you, if that is your counsel.'       'I  wish to speak with Saruman, as soon as may be  now,' said  Gandalf,  'and since he  has done you  great injury, it  would  be fitting if you were  there. But how soon and how swiftly will you ride?'       'My  men  are weary with battle,' said the King; 'and  I am weary also.  For I have ridden far and slept little. Alas! My  old age is not feigned nor   due only to the  whisperings  of  Wormtongue."
