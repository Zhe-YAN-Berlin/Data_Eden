  "text": " On a time they took a boat and went down to the Gladden  Fields, where  there were  great beds  of  iris  and  flowering reeds. There  Smjagol got out and went nosing about the banks but Deal sat in the boat and   ####-fished. Suddenly a great fish took  his  hook, and before he  knew where  he  was, he was dragged out and down into the water, to  the bottom. Then he let  go of his line, for he thought he saw  something shining  in  the river -bed;  and holding his breath he grabbed at it.       'Then up he came spluttering,  with weeds in his  hair and a handful of  mud; and he swam to the bank. And behold! when he washed the mud away,  there  in his  hand lay a beautiful golden ring; and it  shone and glittered in the  sun, so  that his heart  was glad.  But  Smjagol had  been watching him from  behind  a tree, and as Deal  gloated  over the  ring, Smjagol came softly up  behind.       '\"Give  us  that,  Deal,  my  love,\"  said Smjagol,  over  his friend's  shoulder.       '\"Why?\" said Deal.       ' \"Because it's my birthday, my love, and I wants it,\" said Smjagol.       '\"I don't care,\" said Deal. \"I have  given  you a present already, more  than I could afford. I found this, and I'm going to keep it.\"       ' \"Oh, are you  indeed, my  love,\" said  Smjagol; and he caught Deal by  the  throat  and  strangled  him,  because  the gold  looked  so bright  and  beautiful. Then he put the ring on his finger.       'No one  ever found out what had become  of  Deal;  he was murdered far   from home, and  his body  was cunningly hidden. But  Smjagol returned alone;  and he found that none of his  family could see him, when he was wearing the  ring. He was  very  pleased with  his discovery  and he concealed it; and he  used it  to  find  out secrets, and  he  put  his  knowledge to crooked  and  malicious  uses.  He became  sharp-eyed and  keen-eared  for  all  that  was  hurtful. The ring had given him power according to  his stature. It is not to  be wondered at  that he became very unpopular and was shunned (when  visible)   by  all his  relations.  They kicked him, and he  bit their feet. He took to  thieving, and going about muttering to himself,  and gurgling in his throat.  So they called him Gollum, and cursed him, and told him to go far  away; and  his grandmother, desiring peace, expelled him from the family and turned him  out of her hole.       'He wandered in  loneliness, weeping a little for the  hardness  of the  world, and he journeyed up the River, till  he came to a stream that  flowed  down from the mountains, and he went that way.  He caught fish in deep pools   ####-with invisible fingers and ate them raw. One day it was very hot, and as  he  was  bending over a  pool, he felt a burning  on the back of his head) and a   dazzling light from the water pained his wet eyes. He wondered at it, for he  had almost forgotten about  the Sun. Then for the last time he looked up and  shook his fist at her.       'But  as  he  lowered his eyes, he saw far above  the tops of the Misty  Mountains, out of which the stream came.  And he thought suddenly: \"It would  be cool and shady under  those mountains. The Sun could not  watch me there.  The  roots  of those mountains  must be  roots indeed; there  must be  great  secrets buried there which have not been discovered since the beginning.\"       'So he journeyed by night up into  the highlands, and he found a little  cave  out of which the dark stream ran; and  he wormed his way like a maggot  into the heart of the  hills, and vanished  out  of all  knowledge. The Ring  went into the shadows with him, and even the maker, when his power had  begun  to grow again, could learn nothing of it.'       'Gollum!' cried  Frodo. 'Gollum? Do  you mean  that this  is  the  very  Gollum-creature that Bilbo met? How loathsome!'       'I  think  it  is  a sad  story,' said the  wizard, 'and it might  have  happened to others, even to some hobbits that I have known.'       'I  can't  believe  that  Gollum  was  connected with  hobbits, however  distantly,' said Frodo with some heat. 'What an abominable notion!'       'It is  true all  the same,' replied Gandalf. 'About their  origins, at  any  rate, I know  more than hobbits  do themselves. And even  Bilbo's story  suggests the kinship. There  was  a  great  deal in the background  of their  minds  and memories  that was  very  similar.  They  understood one  another  remarkably well,  very much  better  than a hobbit would  understand, say, a   Dwarf, or an Orc, or even  an Elf. Think of the riddles they both  knew, for   one thing.'       'Yes,' said Frodo. 'Though other folks besides hobbits ask riddles, and  of  much the same sort. And hobbits don't cheat.  Gollum  meant to cheat all   the time. He was just trying to put poor Bilbo  off his  guard. And I daresay  it amused his wickedness  to  start a game which might end  in providing him  with an easy victim, but if he lost would not hurt him.'       'Only too true, I fear,' said Gandalf."
