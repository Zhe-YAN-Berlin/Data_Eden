  "text": " But may we not   ####-hear  the proofs? And I would ask this  also. What of Saruman? He is learned  in  the lore of the Rings, yet he is not among us. What is his counsel-if he  knows the things that we have heard?'       `The  questions that you ask, Galdor, are bound together,' said Elrond.  `I had not  overlooked them, and they shall be answered. But these things it  is the part of Gandalf to make clear;  and I call upon  him last, for it  is  the place of honour, and in all this matter he has been the chief.'       `Some,  Galdor,'   said Gandalf, `would think the tidings of Gluin,  and  the pursuit of  Frodo,  proof enough that the halfling's trove is a thing of  great worth to  the Enemy. Yet it is a ring. What then? The Nine the  Nazgyl  keep. The Seven are taken or destroyed.' At this Gluin stirred, but  did not  speak. `The Three we know of. What then is this one that he desires so much?        'There  is indeed  a  wide  waste of time  between  the River  and  the  Mountain, between the loss and the finding. But  the gap in the knowledge of  the Wise  has been  filled at  last. Yet too slowly. For  the Enemy has been  close  behind, closer even than I feared. And well is it that not until this  year, this very summer, as it seems, did he learn the full truth.       'Some here will remember that many years ago I myself dared to pass the  doors of the Necromancer in Dol Guldur,  and secretly explored his ways, and  found thus that our fears  were  true:  he was none other than  Sauron,  our  Enemy of  old, at  length  taking shape  and power  again.  Some,  too, will  remember also that Saruman dissuaded us from open deeds against him, and  for  long we watched him only.  Yet at last, as his shadow grew, Saruman yielded,  and the Council put forth its strength  and  drove  the evil out of Mirkwood  and that was in the very year of the finding of this Ring: a strange chance,  if chance it was.       `But we were  too late, as Elrond foresaw. Sauron  also had watched us,   and had long prepared against our stroke, governing Mordor from afar through  Minas Morgu l, where his Nine servants dwelt, until  all  was  ready. Then he   gave way before us,  but  only feigned to flee,  and soon  after came to the  Dark Tower and openly declared  himself. Then for the  last time the Council  met; for now we learned that  he was seeking ever more eagerly for the  One.  We feared then that  he had some news  of it  that we knew  nothing  of. But  Saruman said nay, and repeated what  he had  said to us before: that the One  would never again be found in Middle-earth.       `  \"At  the worst,\"  said he, \"our Enemy knows that we have  it not and   ####-that it still is  lost. But what was lost may yet be  found, he thinks. Fear  not! His hope will cheat him. Have I not earnestly studied this matter? Into  Anduin the Great it fell; and long ago,  while  Sauron slept, it  was rolled  down the River to the Sea. There let it lie until the End.\"'       Gandalf fell silent, gazing eastward from the porch to the far peaks of  the Misty Mountains, at whose great roots the peril of the world had so long  lain hidden. He sighed.       `There  I was at fault,' he said. `I was lulled by the words of Saruman  the Wise; but I should have sought for the truth sooner, and our peril would  now be less.'       `We were all at  fault,' said Elrond, `and but  for your vigilance  the  Darkness, maybe, would already be upon us. But say on!'       `From the first my heart misgave  me,  against all reason that I knew,'  said Gandalf, `and I desired  to know how this thing came to Gollum, and how  long he had possessed it. So I set a wa tch for  him, guessing that he  would  ere long come forth from his darkness to seek for his treasure. He came, but  he escaped and was not found. And then alas! I let the matter rest, watching   and waiting only, as we have too often done.       `Time passed  with many cares, until my  doubts were awakened again  to  sudden  fear. Whence  came the hobbit's  ring?  What,  if my  fear was true,  should be  done with it? Those  things I must decide. But I spoke yet of  my   dread to none, knowing the peril of an  untimely whisper, if it went astray.  In all the long wars with  the Dark Tower treason has ever been our greatest   foe.       'That was seventeen years ago. Soon I became aware  that  spies of many   sorts, even  beasts and birds,  were gathered round the Shire, and  my  fear  grew.  I called  for the help of the DÂ®nedain, and their watch  was doubled;  and I opened my heart to Aragorn, the heir of Isildur.'       `And I,' said Aragorn, `counselled that we should hunt  for Gollum. too  late though it may seem. And since it seemed fit that Isildur's  heir should  labour to  repair  Isildur's fault, I went  with  Gandalf  on  the  long and  hopeless search.'       Then Gandalf told how they had explored the whole length of Wilderland,  down even to the Mountains of Shadow and the fences of Mordor. `There we  had  rumour of him, and we guess  that he dwelt there long in the dark hills; but  we never found him,  and  at last  I  despaired."
