'In  Minas Tirith  they endure  the East Wind, but they do not ask it for tidings. But now Boromir has taken   ####-his road. and we must make haste to choose our own.'       He surveyed the green  lawn, quickly but  thoroughly, stooping often to  the earth. 'The Orcs have been on this ground,' he  said. 'Otherwise nothing  can be made  out for certain. All  our  footprints  are  here, crossing  and  re-crossing. I cannot  tell  whether any of the hobbits have come back since  the search for  Frodo  began.'  He returned  to the bank, close to where the  rill  from the  spring  trickled  out into  the River. 'There are some clear  prints here,' he  said. 'A hobbit waded out into the water and  back; but  I  cannot say how long ago.'       'How then do you read this riddle?' asked Gimli.       Aragorn did not answer at once, but went back to the  camping-place and  looked  at  the baggage. 'Two  packs  are  missing.' he  said, 'and  one  is  certainly Sam's:  it was rather large and heavy.  This  then  is the answe r:  Frodo  has gone by boat, and his servant has  gone with him. Frodo must have  returned while we were all away. I met Sam going up the hill and told him to  follow me;  but plainly he  did  not do so. He guessed his master s mind and   came  back here before Frodo had gone. He did  not find it easy to leave Sam  behind!'       'But why should  he leave  us behind, and without  a word?' said Gimli.  'That was a strange deed!'       'And a  brave deed,' said Aragorn. 'Sam was right,  I think.  Frodo did  not wish to  lead any friend to death with him in Mordor. But he knew that he  must go himself. Something happened after he left us that  overcame his fear  and doubt.'       'Maybe hunting Orcs came on him and he fled,' said Legolas.        'He fled, certainly,' said Aragorn, 'but not, I think, from Orcs.' What  he  thought was  the cause of Frodo's  sudden resolve and flight Aragorn did   not say. The last words of Boromir he long kept secret.       'Well,  so much  at  least  is now clear,'  said Legolas:  'Frodo is no  longer on this side of the  River:  only he can have taken the boat. And Sam  is with him; only he would have taken his pack.'       'Our  choice then,' said Gimli, 'is either to take the  remaining  boat  and follow Frodo, or else to follow  the Orcs on foot. There is little  hope  either way. We have already lost precious hours.'       'Let me  think!' said Aragorn. 'And now  may I make a  right choice and  change the  evil fate of this unhappy day!' He stood silent for a moment. 'I   will follow the Orcs,' he said at last. 'I would have guided Frodo to Mordor    ####-and  gone with  him to the end; but if I  seek him now  in the wilderness, I  must abandon the captives to torment  and death.  My heart speaks clearly at  last: the fate  of the Bearer  is in  my  hands no  longer .  The Company has  played  its part. Yet we that  remain cannot forsake our companions while we  have strength left.  Come!  We  will go  now. Leave  all  that can be spared  behind! We will press on by day and dark!'       They drew up the  last  boat  and carried  it to  the trees.  They laid  beneath  it such of their goods  as  they did not  need  and could not carry  away. Then they left Parth Galen. The afternoon was fading as they came back   to the glade where Boromir had fallen. There they picked up the trail of the  Orcs. It needed little skill to find.       'No other folk  make such  a trampling,' said Legolas. 'It seems  their  delight to slash and beat down  growing  things that are not even  in  their  way.'       'But they go with a great  speed for all that,' said Aragorn, 'and they  do not  tire. And later we  may have  to  search for our  path  in hard bare  lands.'       'Well, after  them!' said Gimli. 'Dwarves too can  go swiftly, and they  do not tire sooner  than Orcs. But it will be a long chase: they have a long  start.'       'Yes,' said Aragorn, 'we  shall all need the endurance of  Dwarves. But  come! With hope or without hope we will follow the trail of our enemies. And  woe to them, if we prove the swifter! We  will make such a chase as shall be   accounted a marvel among the Three Kindreds Âµ Elves. Dwarves, and Men.  Forth  the Three Hunters!'       Like a deer he sprang away. Through the trees he sped. On and on he led  them,  tireless and swift, now that his mind  was at last made up. The woods  about the lake they left behind. Long slopes  they climbed, dark, hard-edged  against the  sky already red with sunset. Dusk came. They passed away,  grey  shadows in a stony land.     ####-   Chapter 2. The Riders of Rohan            Dusk deepened. Mist lay behind them among the trees below, and  brooded  on  the pale margins of the Anduin, but the  sky was clear. Stars  came out.  The waxing  moon  was riding in the West, and the shadows of the rocks  were  black."
