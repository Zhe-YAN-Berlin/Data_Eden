'In  the  House of Elrond, and it is ten o'clock in  the morning.' said  a voice.  `It is the morning of October the twenty -fourth, if you want to know.'       `Gandalf!'  cried  Frodo, sitting up. There was the old wizard, sitting  in a chair by the open window.        `Yes,' he said, `I am here.  And you  are lucky  to be here, too, after   all the absurd  things you  have done since  you left home.' Frodo lay  down  again. He felt too comfortable and peaceful to argue, and in any case he did  not think he would get the better of  an argument.  He  was fully awake now,   and  the memory of  his  journey  was returning: the  disastrous `short cut'  through the Old Forest the `accident' at The Prancing Pony;  and his madness  in putting  on the Ring  in the dell under Weathertop. While he was thinking  of all these  things and trying  in  vain to  bring  his memory down to  his  arriving  in  Rivendell, there  was a long  silence, broken only by the soft   puffs of Gandalf's pipe, as he blew white smoke-rings out of the window.        'Where's Sam?' Frodo asked at length. 'And are the others all right?'       'Yes, they are  all  safe  and sound,' answered Gandalf.  `Sam was here  until I sent him off to get some rest, about half an hour ago.'       `What happened at the Ford?' said Frodo. `It all seemed so dim somehow;  and it still does.'       'Yes,  it  would.  You were beginning to fade,' answered  Gandalf. 'The  wound was overcoming you at last. A few more hours and you  would have   been  beyond  our aid.  But you have some strength in you, my dear  hobbit! As you  showed in the  Barrow. That was touch and  go: perhaps  the  most  dangerous   ####-moment of all. I wish you could have held out at Weathertop.'       'You seem to know a great deal already,' said Frodo. `I have not spoken  to the others about the Barrow. At first it was too horrible; and afterwards  there were other things to think about. How do you know about it?'       'You have talked long  in your sleep, Frodo,' said Gandalf gently, 'and  it  has not been hard  for me to  read  your mind and memory. Do not  worry!  Though I said  \"absurd\" just now, I did not mean it. I think well of you-and  of the others. It is  no small  feat to have come so far,  and  through such  dangers, still bearing the Ring.'       'We should  never  have done it  without Strider,' said Frodo. `But  we  needed you. I did not know what to do without you.'       'I was delayed,'  said Gandalf, `and that  nearly proved our  ruin. And  yet I am not sure; it may have been better so.'       'I wish you would tell me what happened!'       'All in good time! You are not supposed to talk or worry about anything  today, by Elrond's orders.'       `But  talking would stop me thinking and wondering,  which are quite as  tiring,' said Frodo.  'I am wide awake  now, and  I remember so many  things  that want explaining. Why  were you delayed?  You  ought to tell me that  at  least.'       'You will soon hear all you wish to know,' said Gandalf. 'We shall have  a Council, as soon as you are  well enough. At the  moment  I will only  say  that I was held captive.'       'You?' cried Frodo.       'Yes, I, Gandalf the Grey,'  said the wizard solemnly.  'There are many  powers  in  the world,  for good  or for evil. Some are  greater  than I am.  Against  some  I  have not  yet been measured. But my  time  is  coming. The  Morgul-lord and his Black Riders have come forth. War is preparing!'       `Then you knew of the Riders already -before I met them?'       'Yes, I knew of them. Indeed I spoke of them once to you; for the Black   Riders are the Ringwraiths, the Nine Servants of the Lord of the Rings.  But  I did not know  that they had arisen again or I should have fled with you at  once. I heard news  of them only after  I left you in  June; but that  story  must wait. For the moment we have been saved from disaster, by Aragorn.'       'Yes,'  said Frodo, `it was Strider that saved  us. Yet I was afraid of  him at first. Sam never quite trusted him. I think, not at any rate until we  met Glorfindel.'   ####-     Gandalf smiled. `I have heard all about  Sam,' he said. 'He has no more  doubts now.'       'I am glad,' said Frodo. 'For I have become very fond of Strider. Well,  fond is not the right word.  I mean he is dear to me; though he  is strange,  and grim  at times. In fact, he reminds  me often of you. I didn't know that  any of the Big People were  like that.  I thought, well, that  they were just  big, and rather stupid: kind and stupid like Butterbur; or stupid and wicked  like  Bill Ferny. But then we don't know much about Men in the Shire, except  perhaps the Breelanders.'       `You  don't know  much  even  about them, if you  think old Barliman is  stupid,' said Gandalf."
