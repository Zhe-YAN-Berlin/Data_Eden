  "text": "       Now far ahead the Road has gone,       And I must follow, if I can,       Pursuing it with eager feet,       Until it joins some larger way       Where many paths and errands meet.       And whither then? I cannot say.       He  paused, silent for a moment.  Then without another  word he  turned  away from the lights and voices in the fields and tents, and followed by his  three  companions  went round  into  his garden,  and trotted  down the long    ####-sloping path. He  jumped over  a low place in the hedge  at the bottom,  and   took to the meadows, passing into the night like a  rustle  of wind  in  the  grass.       Gandalf  remained for a  while  staring  after  him  into the darkness.  'Goodbye,  my dear Bilbo  - until our next meeting!' he said softly and went  back indoors.       Frodo came  in soon afterwards, and found him sitting in the dark, deep  in thought. 'Has he gone?' he asked.       'Yes,' answered Gandalf, 'he has gone at last.'       ' I wish - I mean, I hoped until this evening that it was only a joke,'  said Frodo. 'But I knew in my heart  that he  really  meant to go. He always  used to  joke about serious things. I  wish  I had come back sooner, just to  see him off.'       I  think really  he preferred slipping off quietly  in the  end,'  said  Gandalf. 'Don't be too troubled. He'll be all right -  now. He left a packet  for you. There it is!'       Frodo  took the envelope from the mantelpiece, and  glanced  at it, but  did not open it.       'You'll find  his  will and all the other documents in there, I think,'  said  the  wizard.  'You  are  the master of Bag End now. And also, I fancy,  you'll find a golden ring.'       'The ring!' exclaimed Frodo. 'Has he left me that? I wonder why. Still,  it may be useful.'       'It may, and it  may  not,' said Gandalf. 'I should not make use of it,  if I were you. But keep it secret, and keep it safe! Now I am going to bed.'       As master of Bag End Frodo felt  it his painful duty to say good-bye to  the guests. Rumours of strange events had by  now spread all over the field,   but  Frodo would  only say  no doubt everything will be  cleared  up  in the  morning.  About  midnight carriages  came for the important folk. One by one  they rolled away, filled with full but  very  unsatisfied hobbits. Gardeners  came   by  arrangement,   and  removed  in  wheel-barrows  those   that  had  inadvertently remained behind.       Night slowly  passed.  The  sun  rose. The  hobbits rose  rather later.  Morning  went  on.  People  came  and began (by  orders) to  clear away  the  pavilions  and the  tables  and the chairs,  and the  spoons and  knives and  bottles and plates, and the lanterns, and the flowering shrubs in boxes, and  the  crumbs  and   cracker -paper,  the  forgotten   bags  and   gloves   and   ####-handkerchiefs,  and  the uneaten food (a very small  item). Then a number of  other people came (without orders): Bagginses, and Boffins, and Bolgers, and  Tooks, and other  guests that lived or  were staying near.  By mid-day, when  even the best -fed were out and about again,  there  was a large crowd at Bag  End, uninvited but not unexpected.       Frodo  was waiting on the step, smiling, but  looking rather  tired and  worried. He welcomed all  the callers,  but he had not much more to say than  before. His reply to all inquiries  was simply this: 'Mr. Bilbo  Baggins has  gone away; as far as I know, for good.'  Some of  the visitors he invited to  come inside, as Bilbo had left 'messages' for them.       Inside in the  hall there  was piled a large assortment of packages and  parcels and small articles  of furniture.  On  every item there was  a label  tied. There were several labels of this sort:       For ADELARD TOOK, for his VERY OWN, from Bilbo, on an umbrella.  Adelard  had carried off many unlabelled ones.       For  DORA BAGGINS in  memory  of  a LONG correspondence, with love  from  Bilbo, on a large waste-paper basket. Dora was Drogo's sister and the eldest   surviving female  relative of Bilbo and Frodo; she was ninety-nine,  and had  written reams of good advice for more than half a century.       For  MILO BURROWS,  hoping it will be  useful, from B.B., on a gold pen  and ink -bottle. Milo never answered letters.        For ANGELICA'S use, from Uncle Bilbo, on a round convex mirror. She  was  a young Baggins, and too obviously considered her face shapely.       For  the  collection  of HUGO BRACEGIRDLE,  from a  contributor,  on an  (empty) book -case. Hugo was a great borrower of books, and worse than  usual  at returning them.       For LOBELIA SACKVILLE-BAGGINS,  as  a PRESENT,  on  a  case  of   silver  spoons. Bilbo  believed that  she had  acquired a good  many of  his spoons,   while he was away  on his former journey. Lobelia knew that quite well. When  she arrived later in the day, she took the point  at once, but she also took   the spoons.        This  is  only  a  small  selection of  the assembled presents."
