For the black horses  can see, and the  Riders can use men and other creatures as  spies, as we found at Bree.  They  themselves  do not see the  world of light as we  do,  but our  shapes  cast   shadows in  their  minds, which only the  noon sun destroys; and in the dark  they perceive many  signs and forms that are hidden from us:  then they  are   ####-most to be feared. And at all times  they smell the blood  of living things,   desiring and hating it. Senses, too, there are other  than sight or smell. We  can feel their  presence - it troubled our hearts, as  soon as we came here,  and before we saw them; they feel ours more keenly. Also,' he added, and his  voice sank to a whisper, 'the Ring draws them.'       'Is there no escape then?' said Frodo, looking round wildly. 'If I move  I shall be seen and hunted! If I stay, I shall draw them to me!'       Strider laid  his hand on his shoulder. 'There is still hope,' he said.  'You are not alone. Let us take  this wood that is set ready for the fire as  a sign. There  is little  shelter or defence here,  but fire shall serve for   both. Sauron can put fire to his evil uses, as he can  all things, but these  Riders do  not love it, and  fear those who wield  it. Fire is our friend in  the wilderness. '       'Maybe,'  muttered Sam.  'It  is also as good a way of saying \"here  we  are\" as I can think of, bar shouting.'       Down in  the  lowest and most  sheltered corner of the dell  they lit a   fire, and prepared a meal. The shades of  evening began to fall, and it grew  cold.  They  were  suddenly  aware of great  hunger,  for they had not eaten  anything since breakfast; but they dared not make more than a frugal supper.   The  lands ahead were empty of all save birds and beasts, unfriendly  places  deserted by all the races of the  world. Rangers passed  at times beyond the  hills, but they were few and did not stay. Other wanderers were rare, and of  evil sort: trolls might stray down at times  out of  the northern valleys of  the Misty Mountains. Only on the Road  would travellers be found, most often  dwarves, hurrying along on business of their  own, and with no help  and few  words to spare for strangers.       'I don't see how our food can be  made  to  last,' said Frodo. 'We have  been careful  enough in the  last few days, and  this supper is no feast; but  we have used  more than we ought,  if  we  have two weeks  still to go,  and  perhaps more.'       'There is food in the wild,' said Strider; 'berry,  root, and herb; and  I have  some skill as  a  hunter at need. You need not be afraid of starving   before winter comes. But gathering and catching food is long and weary work,  and  we need haste. So tighten your belts, and think with hope of the tables  of Elrond's house!'       The  cold increased as darkness came  on. Peering out from the  edge of  the dell they could see nothing but a grey land now  vanishing  quickly into   ####-shadow. The sky above had cleared again and was slowly filled with twinkling  stars. Frodo and  his companions  huddled  round the fire, wrapped   in every  garment and  blanket they possessed;  but Strider was  content with a single  cloak, and sat a little apart, drawing thoughtfully at his pipe.       As night fell and the light of the fire began to shine out  brightly he  began to  tell  them  tales  to keep their minds  from  fear. He  knew  many  histories and legends  of long ago,  of Elves  and Men and the good and evil   deeds of the Elder Days. They  wondered how  old he was,  and  where he  had  learned all this lore.       'Tell us of Gil-galad,' said Merry suddenly, when he paused  at the end   of a story of the Elf-Kingdoms. 'Do you  know any more  of that old lay that  you spoke of?'       'I do indeed,' answered Strider. 'So also does Frodo,  for  it concerns  us closely.' Merry  and Pippin looked at Frodo,  who  was  staring  into the  fire.       'I know  only the little that Gandalf has  told me,' said Frodo slowly.  'Gil-galad was the last of the great Elf-kings of Middle-earth. Gil-galad is  Starlight in their tongue. With Elendil, the Elf-friend, he went to the land  of------'       'No!' said Strider  interrupting, 'I do not think that tale  should  be  told now with  the servants of the Enemy  at hand. If we  win through to the   house of Elrond, you may hear it there, told in full.'       'Then  tell  u s  some other tale of  the old days,' begged Sam; 'a tale  about  the Elves before the  fading time.  I would dearly  like to hear more  about Elves; the dark seems to press round so close.'       'I will tell you the tale of TinÂ®viel,' said  Strider,  'in br ief - for  it  is a long tale  of which the end is  not known; and  there are none now,  except  Elrond, that remember it aright as it was told of old.  It is a fair  tale, though it is sad, as are all the tales of Middle-earth, and yet it may  lift up your hearts."
