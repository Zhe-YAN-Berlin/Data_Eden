  "text": " Peregrin shall go and represent the Shirefolk; and do not grudge him  his chance of peril, for  though  he has done as well as his fortune allowed  him, he has yet to match your deed. But in truth all now are in like danger.  Though it may be our part to  find bitter end before the  Gate of Mordor, if  we do so,  then you will come also to a last  stand, either here or wherever   the black tide overtakes you. Farewell!'       And  so  despondently Merry now  stood and watched the mustering of the  army. Bergil was with him, and  he  also was downcast; for his father was to  march leading a company of the  Men  of the City:  he could not  rejoin  the  Guard until his case was judged. In that same company Pippin was also to go,  as a soldier of Gondor. Merry could see him not far off, a small but upright  figure among the tall men of Minas Tirith.       At last the  trumpets  rang and the army began to move. Troop by troop,  and company by company,  they wheeled and went off  eastward. And long  after  they had passed away out of sight down the great road to the Causeway, Merry  stood there. The  last glint of the morning sun  on  spear and helm twinkled  and was lost, and still he remained with bowed head and heavy heart, feeling  friendless  and  alone. Everyone  that  he cared for had  gone away into the  gloom  that  hung over the distant eastern sky;  and little  hope at all was  left in his heart that he wou ld ever see any of them again.   ####-     As if recalled by his mood of despair,  the  pain in his arm  returned,  and he felt weak and old, and the sunlight seemed thin. He was roused by the  touch of Bergil's hand.       'Come, Master Perian!' said the lad. 'You are still  in pain, I see.  I  will help you back to the Healers. But do not fear! They will come back. The  Men  of  Minas Tirith  will never be overcome. And  now they  have the  Lord  Elfstone, and Beregond of the Guard too.'       Ere  noon the army  came  to  Osgiliath.  There  all  the  workers  and  craftsmen  that  could  be  spared were  busy. Some were  strengthening  the  ferries and boat-bridges that the  enemy had made and in part destroyed when  they fled; some  gathered  stores and booty; and others  on the eastern side  across the River were throwing up hasty works of defence.       The vanguard passed on through the ruins  of  Old Gondor, and  over the  wide River, and  on up the long straight road that in the high days had been  made to run  from the fair  Tower of the Sun to the tall  Tower of the Moon,   which now was Minas Morgul in its accursed vale. Five miles beyond Osgiliath  they halted, ending their first day's march.       But  the  horsemen  pressed  on  and  ere  evening  they  came  to  the  Cross-roads and the great ring of trees, and all was silent. No sign of  any  enemy  had they seen, no cry or  call had been heard, no shaft had sped from  rock or  thicket by the  way, yet  ever as they went  forward  they felt the  watchfulness  of  the land  increase. Tree and stone,  blade  and leaf  were  listening. The darkness had been dispelled, and far away westward sunset was  on the  Vale of  Anduin, and the white peaks of the mountains blushed in the   blue air; but a shadow and a gloom brooded upon the Ephel DÂ®ath.       Then Aragorn set trumpeters at each of the four roads that ran into the  ring  of trees,  and they blew a great fanfare, and the heralds cried aloud:  'The Lords  of Gondor have returned  and all this  land  that is theirs they  take back.'  The  hideous orc-head that  was  set upon the carven figure was  cast down and  broken in pieces, and the old king's head was raised  and set  in its place once more, still crowned with white and golden flowers: and men  laboured  to wash and pare away all the foul scrawls that orcs  had put upon   the stone.       Now in their debate  some had counselled that Minas Morgul should first   be assailed, and if  they  might take  it,  it should  be utterly destroyed.  'And, maybe,'  said Imrahil, 'the road that leads thence to  the pass  above  will prove  an easier way of  assault upon the Dark Lord  than  his northern   ####-gate.'       But against this Gandalf had spoken urgently, because of  the evil that  dwelt in the valley, where the minds of living men would turn to madness and  horror, and because also of the  news  that Faramir had brought.  For if the  Ring-bearer had indeed attempted that  way,  then above  all they should not  draw the Eye of Mordor thither.  So the next day when the main host came up,  they set a strong guard upon the Cross-roads to make some defence, if Mordor   should send a force  over the Morgul Pass, or should bring  more men up from  the South. For that guard  they chose mostly archers  who knew  the ways  of  Ithilien and would lie hid in the woods and slopes about the meeting  of the  ways. But Gandalf and Aragorn rode with the  vanguard  to  the  entrance  of  Morgul Vale and looked on the evil city.       It was dark and  lifeless; for the Orcs and lesser creatures of  Mordor   that  had  dwelt  there had been destroyed in  battle,  and the  Nazgyl were  abroad."
