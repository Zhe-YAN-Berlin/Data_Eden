Were you a friend of Boromir?'       Vividly before Frodo's  mind came the memory  of Boromir's assault upon  him, and for a moment he hesitated. Faramir's eyes watching him grew harder.  'Boromir was a valiant member of our Company ' said Frodo at length. 'Yes, I  was his friend, for my part.'       Faramir smiled grimly. `Then you would grieve to learn that  Boromir is  dead?  '       'I  would  grieve  indeed,'  said  Frodo.  Then catching  the  look  in  Faramir's eyes, he faltered. 'Dead?'  he said. `Do you mean that he is dead,  and that you knew it? You have been trying to trap me in words, playing with  me? Or are you now trying to snare me with a falsehood?'       `I would not snare even an orc with a falsehood,' said Faramir.       `How then did  he die, and how do  you know of  it? Since  you say that   ####-none of the Company had reached the city when you left.'       'As to the  manner  of  his death, I  had  hoped that  his  friend  and  companion would tell me how it was.'       `But he was alive and strong when we parted. And he lives still for all  that I know. Though surely there are many perils in the world.'       `Many indeed,' said Faramir, `and treachery not the least.'       Sam  had  been  getting more  and  more  impatient  and  angry at  this  conversation. These last words were  more  than he  could bear, and bursting   into the middle of the ring, he strode up to his master's side.       'Begging  your pardon, Mr. Frodo,' he  said, `but this has gone on long  enough. He's no right to talk to you so.  After all you've gone  through, as  much for his good and all these great Men as for anyone else.       'See here,  Captain! ' He  planted himself squarely in front of Faramir  his  hands  on his hips,  and a look on his  face as  if he was addressing a   young  hobbit who  had offered him what  he  called `sauce'  when questioned  about  visits to the orchard. There was some  murmuring, but also some grins  on the faces  of the men looking on: the  sight of  their Captain sitting on  the ground  and  eye to eye with  a young hobbit, legs well apart, bristling  with wrath, was one beyond their experience. `See here! ' he said. `What are  you driving at? Let's come to  the point before all the Orcs of  Mordor come  down on us! If  you think my master murdered this Boromir and then ran away,  you've got no sense; but say it, and have done!  And then  let us  know what  you mean to do  about it. But it's a pity that folk as talk  about  fighting  the  Enemy  can't  let  others  do  their  bit  in  their  own  way  without  interfering. He'd be mighty pleased, if he could see you now. Think he'd got   a new friend, he would.'       `Patience!' said Faramir, but without anger.  `Do not speak before your  master, whose wit is  greater than yours. And I do not need any to teach  me  of our peril. Even  so, I  spare a brief time, in order to judge justly in a   hard matter. Were I as hasty as you, I might have slain you long ago.  For I  am commanded  to slay all whom I find in this land without the leave of  the  Lord of Gondor.  But I do not slay man  or beast needlessly, and  not gladly  even when it is needed. Neither do  I talk  in vain. So be comforted. Sit by  your master, and be silent! '       Sam  sat down heavily with a red face.  Faramir turned to Frodo  again:  'You asked how do I know that the son of Denethor is dead. Tidings of  death  have many wings.  Night oft brings news to  near kindred, 'tis said. Boromir    ####-was my brother.'       A  shadow  of sorrow passed  over his face.  `Do you remember  aught of   special mark that the Lord Boromir bore with him among his gear?'       Frodo  thought for a moment,  fearing some further trap, and  wondering   how this debate would turn in the end. He had hardly saved the Ring from the  proud grasp of Boromir, and how he would fare now among so many men,  warlike  and  strong, he did not know.  Yet he felt in his heart that Faramir, though  he was much like his brother  in  looks, was a man less self-regarding, both  sterner and wiser. 'I remember that Boromir bore a horn,' he said at last.       `You remember  well, and  as  one  who has  in  truth  seen  him,' said  Faramir. `Then maybe you can see it in your mind's eye: a great horn  of the   wild ox of the East, bound with silver, and written with ancient characters.  That horn the eldest son of our house has borne for many generations; and it   is said that if it be blown at need anywhere within the bounds of Gondor, as  the realm was of old, its voice will not pass unheeded.       'Five days ere I set out on this venture, eleven days ago at about this  hour of  the  day, I heard  the blowing of that horn: from the northward  it  seemed, but  dim, as if  it were but an echo in the mind. A boding of ill we  thought it, my father and I, for no tidings had we heard of Boromir since he  went away, and no watcher on our borders had seen him pass."
