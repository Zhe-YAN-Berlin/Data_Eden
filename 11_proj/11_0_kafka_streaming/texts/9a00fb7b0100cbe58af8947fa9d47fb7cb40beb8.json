  "text": "  The   ####-Sackville-Bagginses won't never  see the inside of Bag End now, or it  is to  be hoped not.'       'There's a tidy bit of money tucked away up there, I hear tell,' said a   stranger,  a visitor on  business from  Michel Delving in the  Westfarthing.  'All the top of  your hill is full of tunnels packed with chests of gold and  silver, and jools, by what I've heard. '       'Then you've heard  more than I  can speak  to,' answered the Gaffer. I  know nothing about  jools.  Mr. Bilbo is free with  his money, and there seems  no lack of it; but I know of no tunnel -making. I  saw Mr. Bilbo when he came  back, a matter of  sixty  years  ago,  when I was a  lad. I'd  not long come  prentice to old  Holman (him being my dad's cousin), but he had me up at Bag  End helping  him  to keep folks from trampling and  trapessing  all over the  garden while the sale was on. And in the middle of it all Mr. Bilbo comes up  the Hill  with  a pony and some mighty big  bags and a couple  of  chests. I  don't  doubt  they were mostly full of treasure  he had picked up in foreign  parts, where there be mountains of gold, they  say;  but there wasn't enough  to fill tunnels. But  my lad Sam will know  more about that. He's in and out  of Bag End. Crazy about stories of the old days he is, and he listens to all  Mr. Bilbo's  tales. Mr. Bilbo has learned him his letters  - meaning no harm,  mark you, and I hope no harm will come of it.       'Elves and Dragons' I says  to him. 'Cabbages and  potatoes are  better  for me and  you. Don't go getting mixed up in  the business of your betters,  or you'll land in trouble  too big for you,' I says  to him. And I might say  it to others,' he added with a look at the stranger and the miller.       But the Gaffer did  not convince  his audience. The  legend  of Bilbo's  wealth was now too  firmly fixed in the minds  of the  younger generation of   hobbits.       'Ah, but he has likely enough been adding to what he brought at first,'  argued the miller, voicing common  opinion. 'He's often  away from home. And  look at the outlandish  folk that visit him:  dwarves  coming at night,  and  that old wandering conjuror, Gandalf,  and  all. You can say  what you like,  Gaffer, but Bag End's a queer place, and its folk are queerer.'       'And you can say what you like, about what you know no more of than you   do of boating, Mr. Sandyman,' retorted the Gaffer, disliking the miller even  more  than usual. If  that's being queer, then we could do  with a bit  more  queerness in these parts. There's  some  not  far away that wouldn't offer a   pint of beer to a friend, if they  lived  in  a hole with golden  walls. But   ####-they do things proper at Bag End. Our  Sam says that  everyone's going to be  invited to the party, and there's  going to be presents, mark you,  presents  for all - this very month as is.'       That very month  was  September, and as fine as you could ask. A day or   two  later a rumour (probably  started by the knowledgeable Sam)  was spread  about  that there were going to be fireworks  - fireworks, what is more, such  as had not been seen in the Shire for nigh  on a  century, not indeed  since  the Old Took died.       Days passed  and The Day drew nearer.  An odd-looking waggon laden with  odd-looking packages rolled into Hobbiton one evening and toiled up the Hill  to  Bag End. The startled hobbits peered out of lamplit doors to gape at it.  It was driven  by outlandish  folk, singing strange songs: dwarves with long  beards and deep hoods. A few of them remained at Bag End.  At the end of the  second week in September a cart came in  through Bywater from the  direction  of the  Brandywine Bridge in  broad daylight. An old  man was driving it all   alone.  He  wore a tall pointed blue hat,  a  long grey cloak,  and a silver   scarf. He  had a long white beard and bushy eyebrows  that stuck  out beyond  the  brim of  his  hat. Small hobbit-children ran after the cart all through  Hobbiton and right up the hill. It ha d a cargo of fireworks, as they rightly  guessed. At Bilbo's front door the old man began to unload: there were great  bundles of fireworks of all sorts and shapes, each labelled with a large red  G and the elf-rune, .       That was Gandalf's mark, of course,  and the  old man  was Gandalf  the  Wizard,  whose  fame in the Shire  was  due mainly to  his skill with fires,   smokes, and lights.  His real business was far more difficult and dangerous,  but  the Shire-folk knew nothing about  it. To them  he was just one  of the  'attractions'  at the Party. Hence the excitement of the hobbit-children.  'G   for Grand!' they  shouted, and the old man smiled.  They knew him by  sight,  though he only appeared in Hobbiton occasionally and never stopped long; but  neither they nor  any  but  the  oldest of  their elders had seen one of his  firework displays  - they now belonged to the legendary past.       When the old  man,  helped by  Bilbo  and  some  dwarves,  had finished   unloading."
