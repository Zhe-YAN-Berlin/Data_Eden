My dear  little  fellows, please  believe me when I say that it was  not out of kindness: that's not  even one  of Ugl速k's faults.'       'I find it quite  easy to  believe,' said Merry.  'But you haven't  got  your  prey  home yet. And it doesn't seem  to  be going  your  way,  whatever   happens. If we come  to  Isengard,  it won't  be the  great  Grishnbkh  that  benefits: Saruman will take all  that he can find.  If you want anything for   yourself, now's the time to do a deal.'       Grishnbkh  began  to  lose his  temper.  The  name  of  Saruman  seemed   specially  to enrage him.  Time  was passing  and the disturbance was  dying  down. Ugl速k or the Isengarders might return at any minute.       'Have you got it -- either of you?' he snarled.       'Gollum, gollum!' said Pippin.       'Untie our legs!' said Merry.       They felt the Orc's arms  trembling violently. 'Curse  you, you  filthy  little vermin!' he hissed. 'Untie your legs? I'll untie every string in your  bodies. Do you think I can't search you to the  bones? Search  you! I'll cut  you both to quivering shreds. I don't need the help  of your legs to get you   away-and have you all to myself!'       Suddenly  he seized them. The strength in  his  long arms and shoulders  was  terrifying. He  tucked  them one under  each  armpit, and crushed  them  fiercely to his sides; a great stifling hand was clapped  over each of their  mouths. Then he sprang forward,  stooping low. Quickly and silently he went,   ####-until he  came to the edge  of the knoll. There, choosing a gap  between the  watchers, he passed like an evil shadow out into the  night, down  the slope  and away westward  towards the river that  flowed out of the forest. In that  direction there was a wide open space with only one fire.       After going  a  dozen yards he  halted,  peering and listening. Nothing  could be  seen or heard. He crept  slowly  on, bent almost  double. Then  he  squatted and listened  again. Then he stood up, as if to risk a sudden dash.  At that very moment the  dark form of a  rider loomed up  right  in front of  him. A horse snorted and reared. A man called out.       Grishnbkh flung himself on the ground flat,  dragging the hobbits under   him; then he drew his sword.  No doubt he meant to kill his captives, rather   than allow them  to escape or to  be rescued;  but  it  was his undoing. The  sword  rang faintly, and glinted a  little in the light of the fire away  to  his left. An arrow came whistling out of the gloom: it was aimed with skill,  or guided by fate, and it pierced his right hand. He dr opped the  sword  and  shrieked. There was a quick beat of hoofs, and  even as  Grishnbkh leaped up  and  ran,  he  was ridden down and  a spear  passed through  him.  He gave a   hideous shivering cry and lay still.       The hobbits remained flat on  the  ground, as  Grishnbkh had left them.  Another  horseman came riding swiftly  to his comrade's aid. Whether because  of some special keenness of sight, or because of some other sense, the horse  lifted  and sprang lightly over them; but its rider did  not see them, lying  covered in their elven-cloaks, too crushed for the moment, and too afraid to  move.       At  last  Merry stirred and whispered softly: 'So  far so good: but how  are we to avoid being spitted?'       The answer came almost immediately. The cries of Grishnbkh  had  roused  the Orcs. From the yells  and screeches that came from the knoll the hobbits  guessed  that their  disappearance had been discovered:  Ugl速k  was probably  knocking  off  a  few  more  heads.  Then suddenly  the answering  cries  of  orc-voices came from the  right, outside the circle of watch-fires, from the  direction of the forest and the mountains. Mauh速r had apparently arrived and  was attacking the besiegers. There was  the sound  of galloping  horses. The  Riders  were  drawing  in  their  ring  close  round the  knoll, risking the  orc-arrows, so as  to prevent any sortie, while a company  rode off to  deal  with the newcomers.  Suddenly Merry and Pippin realized  that without moving  they were now outside the circle: there was nothing between them and escape.   ####-     'Now,' said Merry,  'if only we had our legs  and hands free,  we might  get away. But I can't touch the knots, and I can't bite them.'       'No need to  try,'  said Pippin. 'I was going to tell you: I've managed  to free  my  hands. These loops are only  left for show. You'd better have a   bit of lembas first.'       He slipped the cords off his wrists, and fished out a packet. The cakes  were broken, but good,  still in their leaf-wrappings. The  hobbits each ate  two  or three  pieces.  The  taste brought  back  to them the memory of fair  faces,  and laughter, and wholesome food in  quiet  days now far away. For a  while they ate thoughtfully, sitting in the dark, heedless  of the cries and  sounds of battle nearby."
