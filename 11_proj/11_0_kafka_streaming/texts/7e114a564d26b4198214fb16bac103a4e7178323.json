'Lord.' she said, 'if  you must go, then let me ride in your  following. For I am weary of skulking  in the hills, and wish to face peril and battle.'       'Your duty is wi th your people,' he answered.       'Too often have I heard of duty,' she cried. 'But am I not of the House  of Eorl, a shieldmaiden and not a dry-nurse? I have waited on faltering feet  long enough.  Since they falter no longer, it seems, may I not  now spend my  life as I will?'       'Few may do that with honour,' he answered.  'But as for you, lady: did  you not accept the charge to govern the people until their lord's return? If  you had not been chosen, then some marshal or captain would have been set in  the same place, and he could not ride away from his charge, were he weary of  it or no.'       'Shall I always be chosen?' she  said bitterly. 'Shall I always be left   behind when the Riders depart, to mind the house while they  win renown, and  find food and beds when they return?'       'A time may come  soon,' said he, 'when none  will return.  Then  there  will be need of valour  without  renown,  for none shall remember the  deeds  that  are done in  the last defence of your homes. Yet the deeds will not be  less valiant because they are unpraised.'       And she answered: 'All  your words are but to say: you are a woman, and  your part is in the house. But when  the men have died in battle and honour,   you have leave to  be burned in the house, for the men will need it no more.  But I  am of the House of Eorl and not a serving-woman. I can ride and wield  blade, and I do not fear either pain or death.'       'What do you fear, lady?' he asked.       'A cage,' she said. 'To stay behind bars, until use and old age  accept  them, and all chance of doing great deeds is gone beyond recall or desire.'       'And  yet you  counselled  me  not  to adventure on the road that I had   ####-chosen, because it is perilous?'       'So may one counsel another,' she said. 'Yet I do not bid you flee from   peril, but to ride to battle where your sword may win renown and victory.  I  would not see a thing that is high and excellent cast away needlessly.'       'Nor would I,' he  said. 'Therefore  I  say to you, lady: Stay! For you   have no errand to the South.'       'Neither have those others who go with thee. They go  only because they  would not be parted from thee  - because they love thee.' Then she turned and  vanished into the night.       When the light of day was come into the  sky  but  the sun was  not yet  risen above the high  ridges in the East,  Aragorn made ready to depart. His  company was all mounted, and he was  about to leap into the saddle, when the  Lady  Jowyn came to bid them farewell. She was clad as a Rider and girt with  a sword. In her hand she bore a cup, and  she set it to her lips and drank a   little, wishing them  good speed; and then she gave the cup to Aragorn,  and  he drank, and he said:  'Farewell, Lady of Rohan! I drink to the fortunes of  your House, and of you, and of all  your people. Say to your brother: beyond   the shadows we may meet again!'       Then it seemed to Gimli  and Legolas who were nearby that she wept, and  in one  so  stern and proud that seemed  the  more grievous.  But  she said:  'Aragorn, wilt thou go?'       'I will,' he said.       'Then wilt thou not let me ride with this company, as I have asked?'       'I will not, lady,' he said. 'For that I  could not grant without leave  of the king and  of  your brother; and they will not return until  tomorrow.   But I count now every hour, indeed every minute. Farewell!'       Then she fell on her knees, saying: 'I beg thee!'       'Nay, lady,' he said, and taking her by the hand he raised her. Then he  kissed her hand, and sprang into the saddle, and rode away, and did not look   back; and only  those who knew  him well and were  near to him saw  the pain  that he bore.       But Jowyn stood still as  a figure carven in stone,  her hands clenched  at her sides, and she watched  them until they passed into the shadows under   the  black Dwimorberg,  the Haunted Mountain, in which was  the Gate of  the  Dead.  When they were lost  to view, she turned,  stumbling  as  one that is  blind, and went back to her lodging. But none of her folk  saw this parting,  for they hid themselves in fear and would not come forth until  the  day was   ####-up, and the reckless strangers were gone.       And some  said: 'They are Elvish wights. Let them go where they belong,   into the dark places, and never return. The times are evil enough.'       The light was  still grey as they rode, for the sun had not yet climbed  over the black ridges of the Haunted Mountain before  them. A dread  fell on  them, even as they passed between the lines of ancient stones and so came to  the Dimholt.  There under the  gloom of  black  trees  that not even Legolas  could long  endure they found a hollow place opening at the mountain's root,  and right in their path stood a single mighty stone like a finger of doom."
