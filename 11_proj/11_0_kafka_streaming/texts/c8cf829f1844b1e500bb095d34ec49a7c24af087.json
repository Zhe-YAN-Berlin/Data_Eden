Grishnbkh's sword was lying  close at hand, but it was too heavy and clumsy for him to use; so he crawled  forward, and finding the body of the goblin  he  drew from its sheath a long  sharp knife. With this he quickly cut their bonds.        'Now for it!' he said. 'When we've warmed up a bit, perhaps we shall be  able  to stand again, and  walk.  But  in any case  we  had better start  by  crawling.'       They crawled. The turf was deep and yielding, and that helped them: but  it seemed a long slow business. They gave the watch-fire a wide  berth,  and  wormed their way  forward bit  by  bit, until  they came to the edge  of the  river, gurgling away in  the black shadows under its deep   banks. Then  they  looked back.       The sounds  had  died away.  Evidently  MauhÂ®r  and his 'lads' had been  killed or driven off. The Riders had returned to their silent ominous vigil.  It would not last very much longer. Already  the night was old. In the East,  which had remained unclouded, the sky was beginning to grow pale.       'We must get under cover,' said  Pippin, 'or we  shall be seen. It will  not  be any  comfort  to us, if  these riders discover that we are  not Orcs  after we are dead.' He got up and stamped his feet. 'Those cords have cut me  like wires; but my feet are getting warm again. I could stagger on now. What  about you, Merry?'       Merry got up. 'Yes,' he said, 'I can  manage it. Lembas does put  heart  into  you! A more  wholesome sort  of  feeling, too, than  the heat  of that  orc-draught.  I  wonder  what it was made of. Better not to  know, I expect.  Let's get a drink of water to wash away the thought of it!'       'Not here, the banks are too steep,' said Pippin. 'Forward now!'   ####-     They turned and walked side by side slowly along the line of the river.  Behind them the light grew in the East. As they  walked they compared notes,   talking  lightly in  hobbit-fashion of the things  that  had happened  since  their capture. No listener would  have guessed from their words that they had  suffered cruelly, and been in dire peril, going without hope towards torment   and death; or that even now, as they knew  well,  they had  little chance of  ever finding friend or safety again.       'You seem to  have been doing well, Master Took,' said Merry.  'You will  get  almost  a chapter in old Bilbo's book, if ever I get a chance to report  to him. Good work: especially guessing that hairy villain's little game, and  playing up to him. But I wonder if anyone will  ever pick up your trail  and  find that brooch. I should hate to lose mine, but I am afraid  yours is gone  for good.       'I  shall have  to brush up my  toes,  if I am to  get level  with you.  Indeed Cousin Brandybuck is going in front now. This is wher e he comes in. I  don't  suppose  you have much notion  where we are;  but I spent  my time at  Rivendell rather better. We are walking west along the Entwash. The butt-end  of the Misty Mountains is in front, and Fangorn Forest.'       Even as he spoke the da rk edge of the  forest loomed up straight before  them. Night seemed to have taken refuge under its great trees, creeping away  from the coming Dawn.       'Lead on, Master  Brandybuck!' said Pippin. 'Or lead back! We have been  warned against Fangorn. But one so knowing will not have forgotten that.'       'I have  not,' answered Merry; 'but the forest seems better to  me, all  the same, than turning back into the middle of a battle.'       He  led the way  in under the  huge branches  of  the trees. Old beyond  guessing, they  seemed. Great  trailing  beards of lichen  hung  from  them,  blowing and swaying in  the breeze. Out of the  shadows the  hobbits peeped,  gazing back down the slope: little  furtive  figures  that in the  dim light  looked like elf-children  in the deeps  of time peering out of the Wild Wood   in wonder at their first Dawn.       Far  over the  Great  River,  and the  Brown  Lands,  leagues upon grey  leagues away, the Dawn came,  red as flame.  Loud rang the hunting-horns  to  greet it.  The Rider s of Rohan sprang suddenly  to life. Horn  answered horn  again.       Merry and  Pippin heard,  clear  in  the  cold  air,  the  neighing  of  war-horses, and  the  sudden singing of many men. The Sun's limb was lifted,   ####-an  arc of  fire,  above the margin of the world. Then with a great  cry the  Riders charged from  the East; the red  light gleamed on mail and spear. The  Orcs yelled  and shot all the arrows that remained to  them. The hobbits saw  several horsemen fall; but their line held on up  the hill  and  over it, and  wheeled round and charged  again. Most  of the raiders that were  left alive  then broke and fled, this way and that, pursued one by one to the death. But  one band, holding together in a black wedge, drove forward resolutely in the   direction  of  the  forest.  Straight up the slope they charged  towards the  watchers."
