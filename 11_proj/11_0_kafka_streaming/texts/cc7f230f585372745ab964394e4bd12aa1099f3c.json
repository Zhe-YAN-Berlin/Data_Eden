Then standing  up he  looked  over the land ahead, and called to Pippin.       'All ready to start?' he said as Pippin ran up. 'We must be getting off  at once. We slept late; and there are a good many miles to go.'       'You slept  late, you mean,' said Pippin. 'I was up long before; and we  are only waiting for you to finish eating and thinking.'       'I  have finished both now. And I am going to make for Bucklebury Ferry  as quickly  as possible. I am not  going out of the way, back to the road we  left last night: I am going to  cut straight across country from here.'       'Then you are going to fly,'  said Pippin.  'You  won't cut straight on  foot anywhere in this country.'       'We  can  cut  straighter than the road anyway,'  answered  Frodo. 'The  Ferry is east from Woodhall;  but the hard road curves away to the left  -you   can see a bend of it away north over there. It goes round  the north  end of  the Marish so as to  strike  the causeway from  the  Bridge above Stock. But  that is miles out of the way.  We could save a quarter  of the distance if we  made a line for the Ferry from where we stand.'       'Short cuts make  long delays,' argued  Pippin. 'The  country  is rough  round  here, and  there are bogs and  all  kinds of difficulties down in the  Marish -I know the land  in these parts. And if you are worrying about Black  Riders, I can't  see that it is any worse meeting  them on  a road than in a   wood or a field.'       'It is  less  easy  to find people in the  woods and  fields,' answered  Frodo. 'And if you are supposed to be on the road, there is some chance that  you will be looked for on the road and not off it.'       'All right!' said Pippin. 'I will follow  you into every bog and ditch.  But it is  hard! I had counted  on  passing the Golden Perch at Stock before  sundown. The best beer in the Eastfarthing, or used to be: it is a long time  since I tasted it.'       'That settles it!'  said Frodo. 'Short cuts  make delays, but inns make   ####-longer  ones. At all costs we must  keep  you away from the Golden Perch. We  want to get to Bucklebury before dark. What do you say, Sam?'       'I  will go  along with you, Mr. Frodo,' said Sam (in spite of  private  misgiving and a deep regret for the best beer in the Eastfarthing).       'Then  if we are going to toil  through bog and briar, let's  go  now!'  said Pippin.       It was  already nearly as hot as it had been the day before; but clouds  were  beginning  to come up from the West. It looked likely to turn to rain.  The hobbits scrambled down a steep  green  bank and  plunged into the  thick  trees below. Their course  had been chosen to  leave Woodhall to their left,  and  to cut slanting through the woods that clustered along the eastern side  of  the  hills,  until they reached the flats  beyond. Then they  could make  straight  for the Ferry over country that was open, except for a few ditches  and fences. Frodo reckoned they had eighteen miles to go in a straight line.       He soon found that the thicket was closer and more tangled than it  had  appeared. There were no paths  in the  undergrowth, and they did not  get on  very  fast.  When they had struggled to the bottom of the bank, they found a   stream  running  down from  the hills behind in a deeply dug bed with  steep  slippery sides overhung with brambles. Most inconveniently it cut across the  line they had chosen. They could  not jump over it, nor indeed get across it  at  all without  getting wet, scratched, and muddy.  They  halted, wondering   what to do.  'First check!' said Pippin, smiling grimly.       Sam Gamgee  looked back.  Through an opening  in  the trees he caught a  glimpse of the top of the green bank from which they had climbed down.       'Look!'  he said, clutching  Frodo by the  arm. They all looked, and on  the edge high above  them they saw against the sky a horse  standing. Beside  it stooped a black figure.       They  at once gave  up any  idea of going back. Frodo led  the way, and  plunged quickly into the  thick bushes beside the stream. 'Whew!' he said to   Pippin. 'We were both right! The short cut has gone crooked already; but   we  got under  cover only just in time. You've got sharp ears, Sam: can you hear   anything coming?'       They  stood still,  almost holding  their breath as  they listened; but  there was  no sound  of pursuit. 'I  don't fancy  he  would try bringing his  hor se down that bank,' said Sam. 'But I guess he  knows we came down it.  We  had better be going on.'       Going  on was  not altogether easy.  They had packs  to carry,  and the   ####-bushes and  brambles were reluctant to  let  them through. They were cut off   from the wind by  the ridge behind, and the air  was still  and stuffy. When  they forced their way at last into more open ground, they were hot and tired  and very scratched, and they were also no longer certain of the direction in  which they  were  going."
