  "text": "  After a long time  (and the  chant showed no signs  of  sla ckening) he found himself wondering,  since  Entish  was  such  an 'unhasty'  language,  whether they had yet  got  further than Good Morning; and if  Treebeard  was to call the roll, how many  days it would take to sing all their names. 'I wonder what the Entish is for   yes or no,' he thought. He yawned.       Treebeard  was immediately  aware  of him. 'Hm, ha, hey, my Pippin!' he  said,  and the other Ents all stopped their chant. 'You are a hasty folk,  I  was forgetting; and anyway it is  wearisome listening to a speech you do not  understand. You may get down now. I have told your names to the Entmoot,  and  they have seen you, and they have agreed that you are not Orcs, and  that  a   new line shall be put in the old lists. We have got no further yet, but that  is quick work for an Entmoot. You and Merry  can stroll about in the dingle,  if you like.  There is  a well of  good water, if you  need refreshing, away   ####-yonder in the north bank.  There are still  some  words  to speak before the  Moot really begins.  I will come  and see you again, and tell you how things  are going.'       He put the hobbits down. Before they walked away, they bowed  low. This  feat  seemed  to amuse  the Ents very much, to judge by the  tone  of  their  murmurs, and the flicker of their  eyes; but they soon turned  back to their  own  business. Merry  and Pippin  climbed up the path that came in from  the  west, and looked  through the opening in the  great  hedge.  Long  tree-clad  slopes  rose  from  the  lip of  the dingle, and away beyond them, above the  fir-trees of the furthest  ridge there rose, sharp and white, the peak of  a   high  mountain.  Southwards to their left they could see the forest  falling  away  down  into  the  grey distance. There far  away there was a pale green  glimmer that Merry guessed to be a glimpse of the plains of Rohan.       'I wonder where Isengard is?' said Pippin.       'I  don't  know quite where  we are,'  said  Merry;  'but that peak  is  probably Methedras. and as far  as I can remember the  ring of Isengard lies  in a  fork or deep cleft  at the end of the  mountains. It  is probably down  behind this  great ridge. There seems to be a smoke or haze over there, left  of the peak, don't you think?'       'What  is Isengard like?' said Pippin. 'I wonder what Ents can do a bout  it anyway.'  'So do I,' said Merry.  'Isengard is a sort of ring of rocks or   hills, I think, with a flat space inside and an island or pillar of rock  in  the  middle, called Orthanc. Saruman has  a tower  on  it. There  is a gate,  perhaps  more  than   one, in the encircling wall,  and I  believe there is a   stream running  through it; it  comes  out  of  the  mountains, and flows on  across the Gap  of  Rohan. It does not seem the  sort  of place for  Ents to  tackle.  But I  have an odd feeling  about these Ents: somehow I don't think   they are quite as safe and, well funny as  they seem. They seem slow, queer,  and  patient, almost  sad; and yet I believe  they could  be roused.  If that  happened, I would rather not be on the other side.'       'Yes!' said  Pippin.  'I  know  what you mean.  There might be  all the  difference between an old cow sitting and  thoughtfully chewing, and a  bull   charging; and the change might come  suddenly.  I wonder  if  Treebeard will  rouse them. I am sure he means to  try.  Bu t they don't like  being  roused.  Treebeard got roused himself last night, and then bottled it up again.'       The hobbits turned back.  The voices of the Ents were still  rising and  falling in their  conclave. The sun had now risen high  enough to look  over   ####-the high hedge: it gleamed on the tops of  the birches and lit the northward  side of the  dingle  with  a  cool yellow  light.  There they  saw  a little  glittering fountain. They walked along the rim of the great bowl at the feet  of the evergreens-it was pleasant to feel cool grass about their toes again,  and  not to  be in a hurry-and then they climbed down  to the gushing water.   They drank a little,  a clean, cold, sharp  draught, and sat down on a mossy  stone,  watching the  patches of  sun  on the grass and the shadows  of  the  sailing clouds passing over the  floor of the dingle. The murmur of the Ents  went on. It seemed a very strange and remote place, outside their world, and  far from everything  that had ever  happened  to  them. A great longing  came  over them for the faces and voices of their companions. especially for Frodo  and Sam, and for Strider.       At last there came  a pause in the  Ent-voices; and looking up they saw  Treebeard coming towards them. with another Ent at his side.       'Hm, hoom, here I am again,' said Treebeard. 'Are you getting weary, or  feeling  impatient,  hmm,  eh? Well, I  am  afraid  that  you  must  not get  impatient yet. We have finished the first stage now; but I have still got to  explain things again to those that live a  long  way off, far from Isengard,  and those that I could not get round to before the Moot, and  after that  we  shall have to decide  what to do."
