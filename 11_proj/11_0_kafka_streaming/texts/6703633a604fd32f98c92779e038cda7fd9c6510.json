At last he  rose, and now his friends could see his face: it was pale and drawn, and his  look was troubled.       'The rumour of the earth is dim and confused,' he said. 'Nothing  walks  upon it for many miles about  us. Faint and far are the feet of our enemies.   But loud are the hoofs of the horses. It comes to my mind that I heard them,   even  as  I lay on the ground in sleep, and they troubled my dreams:  hor ses  galloping, passing  in the West. But now they are  drawing ever further from  us, riding northward. I wonder what is happening in this land!'       'Let us go!' said Legolas.        So the third day of their pursuit began. During  all its long  hours of  cloud and fitful sun they hardly paused, now striding, now running, as if no  weariness could quench the  fire that burned them.  They seldom spoke.  Over   the  wide solitude they  passed  and their elven-cloaks  faded  against  the  background of the grey-green fields; even  in the cool  sunlight  of mid-day  few but elvish eyes would have marked them, until they  were close  at hand.  Often  in their  hearts  they thanked the Lady  of  Lurien for  the gift  of  lembas, for they could eat of it and find new strength even as they ran.       All day the track of  their enemies led  straight  on, going north-west  without a break or turn. As once again the  day wore to its end they came to   long treeless slopes, where the land rose, swelling up towards a line of low  humpbacked downs ahead. The orc-trail grew fainter  as it bent north towards  them, for  the ground became harder  and the grass  shorter. Far away to the  left  the river Entwash wound, a silver thread in a green floor.  No  moving  thing could be seen. Often Aragorn wondered  that they saw no sign  of beast  or  man. The dwellings of the  Rohirrim were for the most  part many leagues  away to the South, under the wooded eaves of the White Mountains, now  hidden  in mist and cloud;  yet  the Horse-lords  had formerly  kept  many  herds and   studs  in  the Eastemnet, this easterly region of their realm, and there the  herdsmen had wandered much, living  in  camp  and tent, even in winter -time.   ####-But now  all the land was empty, and there was silence  that did not seem to   be the quiet of peace.       At  dusk they halted  again. Now twice twelve  leagues  they had passed  over  the plains of Rohan  and  the wall of  the Emyn Muil was  lost in  the  shadows  of the East. The  young moon  was glimmering in a misty sky, but it  gave small light, and the stars were veiled.       'Now  do I most  grudge  a time of rest or any halt in our chase ' said  Legolas. 'The Orcs have run before us, as if  the very whips  of Sauron were  behind them. I fear they have already reached the forest and  the dark hills,  and even now are passing into the shadows of the trees.'       Gimli ground his  teeth. 'This  is a bitter end to our  hope and to all  our toil!' he said.       'To  hope, maybe, but  not to  toil,'  said Aragorn. 'We shall not turn  back here. Yet I am weary.' He gazed  back along the  way that they had come  towards the night gathering in the East. 'There is something strange at work  in this land.  I distrust the  silence. I  distrust even  the pale Moon. The  stars are  faint; and I am weary a s I have  seldom been before,  weary as no  Ranger should be with a clear trail to follow. There is some will that lends  speed  to our foes and sets an unseen barrier before us: a weariness that is  in the heart more than in the limb.'       'Truly!' said Legolas. 'That I have known since first we came down from  the Emyn Muil. For the will is not behind us but before us.' He pointed away  over the  land  of  Rohan  into  the darkling West  under  the sickle  moon.  'Saruman!'  muttered Aragorn. 'But he shall not  turn  us back!  Halt we must   once more; for,  see! even the  Moon  is falling  into gathering  cloud. But  north lies our road between down and fen when day returns.'       As before Legolas was first afoot, if indeed he had ever slept. 'Awake!   Awake!' he cried. 'It is a red dawn. Strange things await us by the eaves of  the forest. Good or evil, I do not know; but we are called. Awake!'       The others sprang up, and almost at once they set off again. Slowly the  downs  drew near. It was still an hour before  noon when they  reached them:  green slopes rising to bare ridges  that ran in a line straight  towards the  North. At their feet the ground was dry and the turf short, but a long strip  of  sunken  land,  some  ten  miles  wide, lay  between them  and the  river   wandering deep in  dim  thickets of reed  and rush. Just to  the West of the  southernmost slope there was a great ring, where  the turf had been torn and  beaten by many trampling feet. From it  the orc-trail ran out again, turning   ####-north along the  dr y  skirts  of the hills."
