Dernhelm kept close to the  king,   though Elfhelm's company was away on  the right. Grimbold's men turned  aside  and passed round to a great gap in the wall further eastward.   ####-     Merry peered from behind Dernhelm's  back. Far away, maybe ten miles or   more, there was a great burning, but between it and the Riders lines of fire  blazed in  a vast crescent, at the nearest point less than a league distant.  He could make out little more on the dark plain,  and as yet he  neither saw  any hope of morning, nor felt any wind, changed or unchanged.       Now silently the host of Rohan moved forward  into the field of Gondor,   pouring in slowly but steadily, like the rising  tide through breaches in  a   dike  that men  have  thought secure.  But  the  mind  and will of the Black   Captain were bent wholly on the falling city, and   as yet no tidings came to  him warning that his designs held any flaw.       After a while the  king led  his  men away somewhat  eastward, to  come  between  the  fires  of  the siege  and the outer  fields. Still  they  were  unchallenged,  and  still Thjoden gave  no signal. At last  he  halted  once  again. The City was now nearer. A smell of burning was in the air and a very  shadow  of  death.  The horses were uneasy. But the king sat upon  Snowmane,  motionless, gazing upon the agony of Minas Tirith,  as i f  stricken suddenly  by  anguish, or by  dread.  He  seemed to shrink  down, cowed by  age. Merry  himself  felt as  if a great weight of horror and doubt had settled  on him.  His  heart  beat slowly. Time  seemed poised in  uncertainty. They  were too  late! Too late was worse  than never! Perhaps Thjoden would  quail,  bow his  old head, turn, slink away to hide in the hills.        Then suddenly Merry felt  it at  last, beyond doubt: a change. Wind was  in his face! Light was glimmering. Far, far  away, in  the  South the clouds  could be dimly seen as remote grey shapes, rolling up, drifting: morning lay  beyond them.       But at that same moment  there was a flash, as if lightning  had sprung  from the earth beneath the City. For a searing second it stood dazzling  far  off in black and white, its topmost tower like a glittering needle: and then  as the darkness closed  again  there came rolling over  the fields  a  great  boom.       At that sound  the bent shape  of the king sprang suddenly  erect. Tall  and  proud he seemed again; and  rising in his  stirrups he  cried in a loud  voice, more clear than any there had ever heard a mortal man achieve before:       Arise, arise, Riders of Thjoden!       Fell deeds awake: fire and slaughter!       spear shall be shaken, shie ld be splintered,       a sword-day, a red day, ere the sun rises!   ####-     Ride now, ride now! Ride to Gondor!       With that he seized a great horn from Guthlbf his banner -bearer, and he  blew such a blast  upon it  that it burst asunder. And  straightway all  the  horns in the host were lifted up in music, and the  blowing  of the horns of  Rohan  in that  hour was like a  storm  upon the plain and  a thunder in the  mountains.        Ride now, ride now! Ride to Gondor!       Suddenly the king cried to Snowmane and the  horse sprang away.  Behind  him his banner  blew in the wind,  white horse upon a field of green, but he  outpaced it. After  him thundered the knights of his house,  but he was ever   before them.  Jomer rode there, the white horsetail on his  helm floating in  his speed, and the front of the first jored roared like a breaker foaming to  the shore, but Thjoden  could  not  be overtaken.  Fey  he  seemed,  or  the  battle-fury of his fathers ran  like new tire in his veins, and he was borne  up on Snowmane lik e a god of old, even as Oroml the  Great in the battle  of  the Valar when the world was young. His golden shield was uncovered, and lo!   it shone like an image of the Sun, and the grass flamed into green about the  white feet of his steed. For morning came, morning and a  wind from the sea;  and  the darkness was  removed, and the hosts  of Mordor wailed,  and terror   took them, and they fled,  and died, and the hoofs of  wrath rode over them.  And then all the host of Rohan burst into song, and they sang  as they slew,   for the  joy of battle was on  them, and the sound of their singing that was  fair and terrible came even to the City.     ####-   Chapter 6. The Battle of the Pelennor  Fields            But  it was  no  orc-chieftain or  brigand that led  the  assault  upon  Gondor. The darkness was breaking too soon, before the date  that his Master  had set for it:  fortune had betrayed him for  the moment, and the world had  turned against him; victory was slipping from his grasp even as he stretched  out his  hand  to seize it.  But  his arm was long. He was still  in command,  wielding  great  powers. King, Ringwraith,  Lord of the Nazgyl, he  had many  weapons."
