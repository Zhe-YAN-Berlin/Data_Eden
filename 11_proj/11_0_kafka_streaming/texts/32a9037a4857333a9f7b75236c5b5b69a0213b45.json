They… they were throwing things… rocks and filth, eggs… I tried to tell them, I had no bread to give them. A man tried to pull me from the saddle. The Hound killed him, I think… his arm…  Her eyes widened and she put a hand over her mouth.  He cut off his arm.   Clegane lifted her to the ground. His white cloak was torn and stained, and blood seeped through a jagged tear in his left sleeve.  The little bird’s bleeding. Someone take her back to her cage and see to that cut.  Maester Frenken scurried forward to obey.  They did for Santagar,  the Hound continued.  Four men held him down and took turns bashing at his head with a cobblestone. I gutted one, not that it did Ser Aron much good.   Lady Tanda approached him.  My daughter—    Never saw her.  The Hound glanced around the yard, scowling.  Where’s my horse? If anything’s happened to that horse, someone’s going to pay.    He was running with us for a time,  Tyrion said,  but I don’t know what became of him after that.    Fire!  a voice screamed down from atop the barbican.  My lords, there’s smoke in the city. Flea Bottom’s afire.   Tyrion was inutterably weary, but there was no time for despair.  Bronn, take as many men as you need and see that the water wagons are not molested,  Gods be good, the wildfire, if any blaze should reach that… We can lose all of Flea Bottom if we must, but on no account must the fire reach the Guildhall of the Alchemists, is that understood? Clegane, you’ll go with him.   For half a heartbeat, Tyrion thought he glimpsed fear in the Hound’s dark eyes. Fire, he realized. The Others take me, of course he hates flre, he’s tasted it too well. The look was gone in an instant, replaced by Clegane’s familiar scowl.  I’ll go,  he said,  though not by your command. I need to find that horse.   Tyrion turned to the three remaining knights of the Kingsguard.  Each of you will ride escort to a herald. Command the people to return to their homes. Any man found on the streets after the last peal of the evenfall bell will be killed.    Our place is beside the king,  Ser Meryn said, complacent.  Cersei reared up like a viper.  Your place is where my brother says it is,  she spit.  The Hand speaks with the king’s own voice, and disobedience is treason.   Boros and Meryn exchanged a look.  Should we wear our cloaks, Your Grace?  Ser Boros asked.   Go naked for all I care. It might remind the mob that you’re men. They’re like to have forgotten after seeing the way you behaved out there in the street.   Tyrion let his sister rage. His head was throbbing. He thought he could smell smoke, though perhaps it was just the scent of his nerves fraying.  Two of the Stone Crows guarded the door of the Tower of the Hand.  Find me Timett son of Timett.    Stone Crows do not run squeaking after Burned Men,  one of the wildlings informed him haughtily.  For a moment Tyrion had forgotten who he was dealing with.  Then find me Shagga.    Shagga sleeps.   It was an effort not to scream.  Wake. Him.    It is no easy thing to wake Shagga son of Dolf,  the man complained.  His wrath is fearsome.  He went off grumbling.  The clansman wandered in yawning and scratching.  Half the city is rioting, the other half is burning, and Shagga lies snoring,  Tyrion said.   Shagga mislikes your muddy water here, so he must drink your weak ale and sour wine, and after his head hurts.    I have Shae in a manse near the Iron Gate. I want you to go to her and keep her safe, whatever may come.   The huge man smiled, his teeth a yellow crevasse in the hairy wilderness of his beard.  Shagga will fetch her here.    Just see that no harm comes to her. Tell her I will come to her as soon as I may. This very night, perhaps, or on the morrow for a certainty.   Yet by evenfall the city was still in turmoil, though Bronn reported that the fires were quenched and most of the roving mobs dispersed. Much as Tyrion yearned for the comfort of Shae’s arms, he realized he would go nowhere that night.  Ser Jacelyn Bywater delivered the butcher’s bill as he was supping on a cold capon and brown bread in the gloom of his solar. Dusk had faded to darkness by then, but when his servants came to light his candles and start a fire in the hearth, Tyrion had roared at them and sent them running. His mood was as black as the chamber, and Bywater said nothing to lighten it.  The list of the slain was topped by the High Septon, ripped apart as he squealed to his gods for mercy. Starving men take a hard view of priests too fat to walk, Tyrion reflected.  Ser Preston’s corpse had been overlooked at first; the gold cloaks had been searching for a knight in white armor, and he had been stabbed and hacked so cruelly that he was red-brown from head to heel.  Ser Aron Santagar had been found in a gutter, his head a red pulp inside a crushed helm.  Lady Tanda’s daughter had surrendered her maidenhood to half a hundred shouting men behind a tanner’s shop."
