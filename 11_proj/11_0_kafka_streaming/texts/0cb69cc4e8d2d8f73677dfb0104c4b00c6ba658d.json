Now  all the  great assembly was falling into shadow, and yet, though the night -chill blew  cold  from  the heights  no  lanterns  glowed, no fires  were  lit. Watchmen  heavily cloaked paced to and fro.       Merry wondered  how many Riders there  were. He  could  not guess their  number in the gathering gloom, but it  looked to him like a great army, many  thousands strong. While  he was  peering from side  to side the king's party  came up under the looming cliff on the eastern side of the valley; and there  suddenly the path began to climb, and Merry looked up in  amazement.  He  was  on a road the like of which he had never seen before,  a great work of men's  hands in years beyond the  reach of  song. Upwards it wound, coiling  like a   snake, boring its way across the  sheer slope of rock.  Steep as a stair, it  looped  backwards and forwards as it  climbed. Up it horses  could walk, and  wains  could be slowly hauled; but no  enemy could come that way, except out  of the air,  if it was defended from above. At each turn  of the road  there  were great standing stones that had been carved in the likeness of men, huge  and clumsy-limbed, squatting cross-legged  with  their stumpy arms folded on  fat bellies. Some in the wearing of the years had lost all features save the  dark  holes of  their eyes that  still stared  sadly  at the passers-by. The  Riders hardly glanced at them.  The  P®kel-men they  called them, and heeded  them little:  no power or terror was left in them; but  Merry  gazed at them  with wonder  and a feeling almost of pity,  as they loomed up  mournfully in  the dusk.       After a while he looked back and found that he had already climbed some  hundreds of feet  above the valley, but still far below he could dimly see a    ####-winding  line of Riders crossing the ford and filing along the  road towards  the camp prepared for  them. Only the king  and his guard were going up into  the Hold.       At last the king's company came to a sharp brink, and the climbing road  passed into a cutting between walls of rock, and  so went  up a  short slope  and  out  on  to a  wide  upland.  The  Firienfeld  men called it,  a  green  mountain-field of grass and heath, high above the deep -delved courses of the  Snowbourn,  laid upon the lap of the great mountains  behind:  the Starkhorn  southwards, and northwards the saw-toothed mass of  Irensaga, between  which  there faced the riders, the  grim black wall  of the Dwimorberg, the Haunted  Mountain rising out of  steep slopes of  sombre  pines. Dividing the  upland  into  two  there  marched  a double  line of unshaped standing  stones  that  dwindled into the dusk and vanished in the  trees. Those who dared to follow  that road came soon to the black Dimholt under Dwimorberg, and the menace  of  the pillar of stone, and the yawning shadow of the forbidden door.       Such was the dark Dunharrow, the work of long -forgotten men. Their name  was lost and no song or legend remembered it. For what purpose they had  made  this place,  as a town  or secret temple or a tomb of kings, none could say.  Here they laboured in the Dark Years, before ever a ship came to the western  shores, or Gondor of the D®nedain was built; and now  they had vanished, and  only the old P®kel -men were left, still sitting at the turnings of the road.       Merry stared at the lines of marching stones: they were worn and black;  some  were  leaning, some were  fallen,  some cracked or broken; they looked  like  rows  of old  and hungry teeth. He wondered what they could be, and he  hoped  that the king was not going to follow  them into the darkness beyond.   Then  he saw that there were  clusters of tents and booths on either side of  the stony way; but these were not set near the  trees, and seemed rather  to  huddle  away  from them towards the  brink of the  cliff. The greater number   were on the right, where the Firienfeld was wider; and on the left there was  a smaller camp, in the midst of which stood a  tall pavilion. From this side  a rider now came out to meet them, and they turned from the road.       As  they drew near  Merry  saw  that  the rider was a  woman  with long  braided hair gleaming  in the twilight,  yet she wore a helm and was clad to  the waist like a warrior and girded with a sword.       'Hail,  Lord of  the  Mark!'  she  cried. 'My  heart  is  glad  at your   ####-returning.'       'And you, Jowyn,' said Thjoden, 'is all well with you?'       'All  is well,' she  answered; yet it  seemed to  Merry  that her voice  belied her,  and he would have  thought that she had  been weeping, if  that  could be believed of one so stern of face."
