'It's like  this,' he began,  hesitating and looking troubled. 'If I've  done any harm, I'm sorry indeed. But one thing drives out another, as you'll   ####-admit; and  I'm a busy man.  But first one thing and then another  this week   have jogged my memory, as the saying goes; and not too late I hope. You see,  I was asked to look out for hobbits of the Shire, and for one by the name of  Baggins in particular.'       'And what has that got to do with me?' asked Frodo.       'Ah! you know best,'  said the landlord, knowingly.  'I won't give  you   away;  but  I  was  told that  this  Baggins would be going by  the  name of  Underhill, and I was given a description that fits you  well enough, if I may  say so.'       'Indeed! Let's have it then!' said Frodo, unwisely interrupting.       'A stout  little fellow with red cheeks,' said  Mr. Butterbur solemnly.  Pippin chuckled,  but Sam looked indignant. 'That won't  help  you  much; it  goes for  most hobbits. Barley, he says to me,' continued Mr. Butterbur with  a glance at Pippin.  'But this one is taller than some and fairer than most,  and he  has a cleft in his  chin: perky chap with a bright eye. Begging your  pardon, but he said it, not me.'       'He said it? And who was he?' asked Frodo eagerly.       'Ah! That was Gandalf, if you know who I mean. A wizard they say he is,  but he's a  good  friend of mine, whether or no. But now  I  don't know what  he'll have to say to me, if I see him again: turn all my ale sour or me into  a block of  wood, I  shouldn't wonder. He's  a  bit hasty. Still what's done  can't be undone. '       'Well, what have you done?' said Frodo, getting impatient with the slow  unravelling of Butterbur's thoughts.       'Where was I?' said the landlord,  pausing  and  snapping  his fingers.   'Ah,  yes!  Old Gandalf. Three  months  back he walked  right  into  my room  without  a  knock. Barley, he says, I'm off in  the  morning.  Will  you  do  something for me? You've  only to name it,  I said. I'm in a hurry,  said he,  and  I've no time myself, but I want  a message took to the Shire. Have  you  anyone you can send, and trust to go? I can find someone, I  said, tomorrow,   maybe, or the day after. Make it tomorrow,   he says, and then he gave  me  a   letter.       'It's addressed plain enough,' said Mr.  Butterbur,  producing a letter   from his pocket,  and reading out the  address slowly and proudly (he valued   his reputation as a lettered man):       Mr FRODO BAGGINS, BAG END, HOBBITON in the SHIRE.       'A letter for me from Gandalf!' cried Frodo.   ####-     'Ah!' said Mr. Butterbur. 'Then your right name is Baggins?'       'It is,' said Frodo, 'and you had better give me that  letter  at once,  and explain  why  you  never sent it.  That's  what you came  to tell  me, I  suppose, though you've taken a long time to come to the point.'       Poor Mr. Butterbur looked  troubled.  'You're right, master,' he  said,  'and I beg  your pardon. And I'm mortal  afraid of what Gandalf will say, if  harm comes  of it. But I didn't  keep  it back a -purpose. I put  it by safe.  Then I couldn't find nobody willing to go to the Shire next day, nor the day  after, and  none of  my own folk were to spare;  and  then  one  thing after   another drove it out of my mind. I'm a  busy man. I'll do what I can to  set   matters right, and if there's any help I can give, you've only to name it.       'Leaving the letter aside, I  promised Gandalf no less. Barley, he says  to  me, this friend of mine from the Shire, he may  be coming out  this  way  before long, him and another. He'll be calling himself Underhill. Mind that!  But  you need  ask  no  questions.  And if I'm  not with him, he  may  be in   trouble, and  he  may need  help. Do whatever you can for him,  and I'll  be  grateful, he says. And here you are, and trouble is not far off, seemingly.'       'What do you mean?' asked Frodo.       'These  black  men,' said  the landlord lowering  his  voice.  'They're  looking  for  Baggins, and if they mean well, then  I'm a hobbit. It was  on  Monday, and all the dogs were yammering and the geese screaming. Uncanny,   I  called  it. Nob, he came and told me that two  black  men were  at  the door   asking  for a  hobbit called Baggins. Nob's hair was all stood on end. I bid  the  black  fellows be off, and  slammed the door on them; but they've  been  asking the same  question all the  way to  Archet, I hear. And that  Ranger,  Strider, he's been asking  questions, too. Tried to get in here  to see you,  before you'd had bite or sup, he did.'       'He did!' said Strider suddenly, coming  forward into  the light.  'And  much trouble would have been saved, if you had let him in, Barliman.'       The landlord  jumped with surprise.  'You!'  he  cried.  'You're always  popping up."
