Yes, and we could find a  use for  Gimli's axe  and  the bow of Legolas, if  they  will  pardon  my  rash  words  concerning  the Lady of the Wood. I spoke only as do all men in my land, and  I would gladly learn better.'       'I thank you for your fair words,' said Aragorn, 'and  my heart desires  to come with you; but I cannot desert my friends while hope remains.'       'Hope does not remain,'  said Jomer. 'You will not find your friends on  the North-borders.'       'Yet my friends are not behind. We found a clear token not far from the  East Wall that one  at least of  them was still alive there. But between the  wall and the downs  we  have found no  other trace of them, and no trail has  turned aside, this way or that, unless my skill has wholly left me.'       'Then what do you think has become of them?'       'I do not know. They may have been slain and burned among the Orcs; but  that you  will say  cannot be, and I do not fear it. I  can only think  that  they were  carried off into the forest before the  battle,  even  before you   encircled your foes, maybe. Can you swear that none escaped your net in such  a way?'       'I would swear that no Orc  escaped after we sighted them,' said Jomer.  'We reached the forest -eaves before them, and if after that any living thing  broke through our ring, then it was no Orc and had some elvish power.'       'Our  friends  were  attired  even as we  are,' said Aragorn; 'and  you   passed us by under the full light of day.'       'I had forgotten that,' said Jomer. 'It is  hard to be sure of anything  among  so many  marvels. The  world is  all grown strange. Elf and Dwarf  in  company walk in our daily  fields; and folk speak with the  Lady of the Wood  and yet live; and the Sword comes  back to war  that was broken in  the long  ages  ere  the  fathers of our fathers rode into the Mark!  How  shall a man  judge what to do in such times?'       'As he ever has judged,' said Aragorn.  'Good and  ill have not changed  since  yesteryear;  nor  are  they one thing among  Elves and  Dwarves Âµ and  another among Men. It is a man's part to discern them, as much in the Golden  Wood as in his own house.'       'True indeed,' said Jomer. 'But I do not doubt you, nor the  deed which   ####-my heart would do. Yet I am not free to do all as I would. It is against our  law to let strangers wander  at  will  in our land, until the  king  himself  shall  give them leave,  and  more strict is  the command in  these days  of  peril. I have begged you to come back willingly with  me, and you will  not.   Loth am I to begin a battle of one hundred against three.'       'I do not  think your law was  made  for such a chance,' said  Aragorn.  'Nor  indeed am I a stranger; for I have been in this land before, more than  once,  and ridden with the host of the Rohirrim, though under other name and  in other guise. You  I have  not seen before,  for you are young, but I have  spoken with Jomund your father, and with Thjoden  son  of Thengel.  Never in  former days  would  any high lord of  this land  have  constrained a man  to  abandon such a quest as mine. My duty at least is clear, to go on. Come now,  son of Jomund, the choice must be made at last. Aid us,  or at the worst let  us go free. Or seek to carry  out your law. If you do so there will be fewer   to return to your war or to your king.'       Jomer was silent for a  moment,  then he  spoke. 'We both have need  of  haste,' he said. 'My  company chafes to be away, and every hour lessens your  hope. This  is my choice.  You  may go;  and  what  is more, I will lend you   horses. This  only I ask: when  your quest is achieved, or  is  proved vain,  return  with  the horses over the  Entwade  to Meduseld,  the high house  in  Edoras  where Thjoden now sits. Thus you shall prove to him that I  have not  misjudged. In this I place myself, and maybe my very life, in the keeping of  your good faith. Do not fail.'       'I will not,' said Aragorn.       There  was great wonder, and many dark  and doubtful glances, among his  men, when Jomer gave orders that  the  spare horses were to be  lent to  the  strangers; but only Jothain dared to speak openly.       'It  may be  well enough  for this lord  of the race of Gondor,  as  he  claims,' he said, 'but who has heard of a horse of the Mark being given to a   Dwarf?'       'No one,' said Gimli. 'And do not trouble: no one will ever hear of it.  I would sooner  walk  than si t  on the back  of any beast so great,  free or  begrudged.'       'But you must ride now, or you will hinder us,' said Aragorn.       'Come, you shall sit  behind me, friend  Gimli, said Legolas.  Then all  will be well, and you need neither borrow a horse nor be troubled by one.'       A great dark-grey horse  was  brought to  Aragorn, and  he  mounted it."
