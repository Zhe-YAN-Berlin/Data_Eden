There will always  be some folk, big or little, and even a few wise  dwarves like Gimli, who need you. At least I  hope so. Though I feel somehow  that the worst of this war is still to come. How I wish it was all over, and  well over!'       'Don't  be  so gloomy!' cried Pippin.  'The Sun is shining, and here we  are  together  for a day or two at least. I want to hear more about you all.  Come, Gimli!  You  and  Legolas have mentioned  your  strange  journey  with  Strider about a dozen times  already  this  morning. But you haven't told me  anything about it.'       'The Sun may  shine here,' said Gimli, 'but  there are memories of that  road  that I do not wish to recall out of the darkness. Had I known what was  before me, I think  that not for any friendship would I have taken the Paths  of the Dead.'       'The Paths of the Dead?' said Pippin.  'I heard Aragorn say  that and I  wondered what he could mean. Won't you tell us some more?'       'Not willingly,' said Gimli.  'For upon that road  I  was put to shame:  Gimli Gluin's son, who had deemed  himself  more tough than Men, and  hardier  under  earth than  any Elf. But neither did  I prove;  and I was held to the  road only by the will of Aragorn.'       'And by the love of him also,' said Legolas. 'For all those who come to  know him come to love him after his own fashion,  even the cold maiden of the  Rohirrim. It was at early morn of the day ere you came there, Merry, that we  left Dunharrow, and such a fear was  on all the folk that none would look on  our going,  save the Lady Jowyn, who lies now hurt in the House below. There  was grief at that parting, and I was grieved to behold it.'       'Alas! I had heart only for myself,' said Gimli. 'Nay! I will not speak  of that journey.'       He fell silent;  but Pippin and  Merry were  so eager for news that  at   ####-last  Legolas  said:  'I will tell you enough for your peace;  for I felt not  the  horror, and I feared not the shadows of  Men, powerless and frail  as I  deemed them.'       Swiftly then he told of  the haunted  road under the mountains, and the  dark tryst at Erech, and the gr eat ride thence, ninety leagues and three, to  Pelargir on Anduin. 'Four days and nights, and on into a fifth, we rode from  the Black Stone,' he said.  'And lo! in the darkness of Mordor my hope rose;   for in that  gloom the Shadow Host seemed to grow stronger and more terrible  to look upon. Some I saw riding, some striding, yet all moving with the same  great speed. Silent they were, but there was a gleam in  their eyes. In  the  uplands of Lamedon they overtook our horses, and  swept round us, and  would  have passed us by, if Aragorn had not forbidden them.       'At his command they fell back. \"Even the shades of Men are obedient to  his will,\" I thought. \"They may serve his needs yet! \"       'One day of light  we  rode, and then  came the  day  without dawn, a nd  still we rode on, and  Ciril and Ringlu we crossed; and on  the third day we  came to  Linhir above  the mouth  of  Gilrain.  And  there  men  of  Lamedon  contested the fords with fell folk  of Umbar and Harad who had sailed up the  river. But  defenders   and  foes alike gave up  the battle and fled  when we  came,  crying out that the King of the Dead was upon them. Only Angbor, Lord  of Lamedon, had the heart to abide us; and Aragorn bade  him gather his folk  and come behind, if they dared, when the Grey Host had passed.       ' \"At Pelargir the Heir of Isildur will have need of you,\" he said.       'Thus we crossed  over Gilrain,  driving the allies  of  Mordor in rout  before us; and then we rested a while. But soon Aragorn  arose, saying: \"Lo!   already  Mina s Tirith is assailed. I  fear that it  will fall ere we come to  its aid.\" So  we mounted again before  night had passed and went on with all   the speed that our horses could endure over the plains of Lebennin.'       Legolas paused  and  sighed,  and turning his eyes southward softly  he  sang:       Silver flow the streams from Celos to Erui       In the green fields of Lebennin!       Tall grows the grass there. In the wind from the Sea       The white lilies sway,       And the golden bells are shaken of mallos and alfirin        In the green fields of Lebennin,       In the wind from the Sea!   ####-     'Green are those  fields in the songs of my people; but  they were dark  then,  grey  wastes  in  the blackness  before  us. And over  the wide land,  trampling unheeded the grass and  the flowers, we hunted our foes through  a  day and a night, until we came at the bitter end to the Great River at last.       'Then I thought in my heart that we drew near to the  Sea; for wide was  the  water in the darkness, and sea -birds innumerable cried on its,  shores.   Alas  for  the wailing of the  gulls! Did  not the Lady tell me to beware of  them? And now I cannot forget them.'       'For my part  I heeded them not,' said Gimli; 'for we came then at last   upon battle in earnest."
