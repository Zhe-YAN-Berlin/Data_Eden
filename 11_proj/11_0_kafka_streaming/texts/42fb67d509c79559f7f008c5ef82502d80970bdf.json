I've--'; but just then  a savage kick warned Pippin  that the noise had died down, and the guards were watchful.       The night was  cold  and still. All round the knoll  on which  the  Orcs  were gathered little watch-fires sprang up,  golden-red  in the  darkness, a   complete ring  of them. They were within a long bowshot.  but the riders did  not  show themselves against  the light,  and the  Orcs wasted  many  arrows  shooting at the  fires, until Ugl®k  stopped them. The riders made no sound.   Later  in the night when the moon came  out of the  mist,  then occasionally  they could be seen, shadowy  shapes that glinted now and again in the  white  light, as they moved in ceaseless patrol.       'They'll wait for the Sun, curse them!' growled one of the guards. 'Why  don't we get together and charge through? What's old Ugl®k think he's doing,  I should like to know?'       'I daresay you would,' snarled Ugl®k stepping up from behind.   'Meaning  I don't think at all, eh? Curse you! You're as bad as the  other rabble: the  maggots and the apes of Lugb®rz. No good trying  to charge with them. They'd  just squeal  and bolt,  and  there  are  more than  enough of  these  filthy  horse-boys to mop up our lot on the flat.       'There's only one thing those maggots can do: they can see like gimlets  in the dark. But these Whiteskins have better night-eyes than most Men, from  all  I've   heard;  and  don't  forget  their  horses!   They  can  see  the   ####-night-breeze,  or  so it's  said. Still  there's  one thing the fine fellows  don't know: Mauh®r and his lads are  in the forest, and they  should turn up  any time now.'       Ugl®k's words were enough, apparently, to satisfy  the Isengarders; but  the  other Orcs  were  both  dispirited  and  rebellious.  They posted a few  watchers,  but  most of them lay  on  the ground,  resting  in the  pleasant  darkness. It did indeed become very dark again; for the moon passed westward  into thick cloud, and  Pippin could not  see anything  a few feet away.  The  fires brought no light to the hillock. The riders were not, however, content  merely to wait  for  the dawn and let their enemies rest. A sudden outcry on  the  east side of the  knoll showed that something was wrong. It seemed that  some of the Men  had ridden in  close, slipped  off their horses, crawled to  the edge of the camp and killed several Orcs, and then had faded away again.  Ugl®k dashed off to stop a stampede.       Pippin  and  Merry sat up.  Their guards,  Isengarders,  had  gone with  Ugl®k. But  if the hobbits  had any thought of escape, it was soon dashed. A  long hairy arm took each of them by the neck and drew  them close  together.  Dimly they were  aware of  Grishnbkh's great head and hideous  face  between  them; his foul breath  was on their cheeks. He began  to paw  them  and feel   them. Pippin shuddered as hard cold fingers groped down his back.       'Well,  my little  ones!' said Grishnbkh  in a soft whisper.  'Enjoying  your nice rest? Or not? A little awkwardly placed, perhaps: swords and whips  on one side, and nasty spears on  the other! Little people should not meddle  _in  affairs that  are too big for them.'  His  fingers continued  to grope.  There was a light like a pale but hot fire behind his eyes.       The  thought came suddenly into Pippin's mind, as if caught direct from  the urgent  thought  of his enemy:  'Grishnbkh  knows about  the  Ring! He's  looking for it, while Ugl®k is busy: he probably wants it for himself.' Cold  fear was in Pippin's heart,  yet at the  same time he was wondering what use  he could make of Grishnbkh's desire.       'I don't think you will find it that way,' he whispered. 'It isn't easy  to find.'       'Find  it? ' said Grishnbkh:  his  fingers  stopped crawling and gripped  Pippin's shoulder. 'Find what? What are you talking about, little one?'. For   a moment Pippin was silent. Then suddenly in the darkness he made a noise in  his throat: gollum, gollum. 'Nothing, my precious,' he added.       The hobbits felt Grishnbkh's fingers  twitch. 'O ho!' hissed the goblin   ####-softly. 'That's what he means, is it? O  ho! Very ve-ry dangerous, my little  ones.'       'Perhaps,' said Merry, now alert and aware of Pippin's guess. 'Perhaps;   and not only  for us. Still you know your own business best. Do you want it,   or not? And what would you give for it?'       'Do I  want it? Do I want it?' said Grishnbkh, as if  puzzled;  but his  arms were trembling. 'What would I give for it? What do you mean?'       'We  mean,'  said Pippin, choosing his  wor ds carefully,  'that it's no  good groping in  the dark. We could save you  time and trouble. But you must   untie our legs first, or we'll do nothing, and say nothing.'       'My dear tender  little fools,' hissed Grishnbkh, 'everything you have,  and everything you  know, will be got  out of you  in due  time: everything!   You'll wish there was more  that  you could tell to  satisfy the Questioner,  indeed you will:  quite soon."
