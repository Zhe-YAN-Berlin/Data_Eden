'Now indeed there is hope of victory!' said Jomer.       'Hope,  yes,' said Gandalf. 'But Isengard  is strong. And  other perils  draw ever nearer. Do not delay, Thjoden,  when we are gone. Lead your people  swiftly to the Hold of Dunharrow in the hills!'       'Nay,  Gandalf!' said  the king.  'You do not know your  own  skill  in  healing. It shall not be so. I myself will go to war, to fall  in  the front  of the battle, if it must be. Thus shall I sleep better.'   ####-     'Then even the defeat of Rohan will be glorious in song,' said Aragorn.  The armed men that st ood  near clashed their weapons, crying:  'The  Lord of  the Mark will ride! Forth Eorlingas!'       'But  your  people  must  not be  both  unarmed and shepherdless'  said  Gandalf. 'Who shall guide them and govern them in your place?'       'I will take thought for that  ere I go,' answered Thjoden. 'Here comes  my counsellor.'       At  that moment  Hbma  came  again from  the hall. Behind him  cringing   between two other men, came Grnma  the  Wormtongue. His face was very  white.  His eyes blinked in the sunlight. Hbma knelt and presented to Thjoden a long  sword in a scabbard clasped with gold and  set with green gems. 'Here, lord,   is Herugrim, your  ancient blade,' he said. 'It was found in his chest. Loth  was  he to render up  the  keys. Many other things are there which  men have  missed.'       'You lie,'  said Wormtongue.  'And  this sword your master himself gave  into my keeping.'       'And  he  now  requires  it  of  you again,' said  Thjoden. 'Does  that  displease you?'       'Assuredly not. lord,' said  Wormtongue. 'I care for you and  yours  as  best I may. But do not weary yourself, or tax too heavily your strength. Let  others deal  with these irksome guests. Your meat is  about to be set on the  board. Will you not go to it?'       'I will,' said Thjoden. 'And let food for my guests be set on the board  beside me. The host rides today. Send the heralds forth! Let them summon all  who dwell nigh!  Every  man and strong lad able to bear  arms,  all who have  horses, let them be ready in the saddle at the gate ere the second hour from  noon!'       'Dear  lord!'  cried Wormtongue.  'It  is as I feared. This wizard  has  bewitched  you.  Are  none  to  be  left to defend  the  Golden Hall of your  fathers, and all your treasure? None to guard the Lord of the Mark?'       'If this is bewitchment,' said Thjoden, 'it seems to me more  wholesome  than your whisperings. Your leechcraft ere long would have had me walking on  all  fours like  a beast.  No, not  one shall be left, not even Grnma. Grnma   shall ride too. Go! You have ye t time to clean the rust from your sword.'       'Mercy, lord!' whined Wormtongue,  grovelling on the ground. 'Have pity  on one worn out in your service. Send me not from your side! I at least will   ####-stand by you  when all  others have gone.  Do  not send your  faithful Grnma   away!'       'You have my pity,' said Thjoden. 'And I do not send you from my  side.  I  go myself to  war with my  men.  I  bid  you come with me and prove  your  faith.'       Wormtongue looked from face to face. In his eyes was the hunted look of  a beast seeking some gap in the ring of his enemies. He licked his lips with  a  long pale tongue. 'Such a resolve  might be expected  from a lord of  the  House  of Eorl,  old though  he be,' he  said. 'But those who truly love him  would spare his failing years. Yet I  see that I come too late. Others, whom  the death of my lord would perhaps grieve less, have already persuaded  him.  If I cannot undo their work,  hear me at least in  this, lord! One who knows  your mind  and honours your  commands shou ld  be  left in  Edoras. Appoint a   faithful  steward.  Let your  counsellor Grnma  keep  all  things till  your  return-and  I pray  that we  may  see it,  though no  wise man  will deem it  hopeful.'       Jomer  laughed. 'And if  that plea does not excuse you  from war,  most   noble Wormtongue,' he said, what office of less honour would you accept?  To  carry a sack of meal up  into the mountains-if any man would trust you  with   it?'       'Nay,  Jomer,  you  do  not  fully  understand   the  mind   of  Master   Wormtongue,' said Gandalf, turning his piercing glance upon him. 'He is bold  and cunning. Even now he plays a game with  peril and wins a throw. Hours of  my precious time he has wasted already. 'Down snake!' he said suddenly in  a  terrible voice. 'Down on  your belly!  How long is it  since  Saruman bought  you? What was  the promised price? When all the  men were  dead, you were to  pick your  share of  the treasure, and take the woman  you  desire? Too long  have you watched her under your eyelids and haunted her steps.'       Jomer grasped his sword. 'That I knew  already,' he muttered. 'For that  reason I would  have slain him  before,  forgetting the law of the hall."
