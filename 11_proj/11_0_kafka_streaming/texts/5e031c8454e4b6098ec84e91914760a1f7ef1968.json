A sword rang as it was drawn. 'Do what you will; but  I will hinder it,  if I may.'       'Hinder me? Thou fool. No living man may hinder me!'       Then  Merry heard of all sounds in that  hour the  strangest. It seemed  that Dernhelm laughed, and the clear voice was like the  ring of steel. 'But  no living man am I! You look upon a  woman.  Jowyn I am, Jomund's   daughter.  You  stand  between me and my lord and kin. Begone, if you be not deathless!   For living or dark undead, I will smite you, if you touch him.'       The winged creature screamed at her, but the Ringwraith made no answer,  and was silent, as if in sudden doubt. Very amazement for a moment conquered  Merry's fear. He  opened his  eyes  and the  blackness was lifted from them.  There some paces from him sat the great beast, and all seemed dark about it,  and above  it loomed the  Nazgyl Lord like a shadow of despa ir.  A little to  the left facing them stood she whom he had called Dernhelm. But the  helm of  her  secrecy,  had fallen from  her, and her bright  hair, released from its  bonds, gleamed with pale gold upon  her shoulders. Her eyes  grey as the sea  were  hard  and fell, and yet tears were  on  her cheek. A sword was in  her   hand, and she raised her shield against the horror of her enemy's eyes.        Jowyn  it  was,  and  Dernhelm  also. For into Merry's mind flashed the  memory of the face that he saw at the riding from Dunharrow: the face of one  that goes seeking death, having no  hope. Pity  filled his heart  and  great  wonder, and suddenly the slow-kindled courage of his race awoke. He clenched  his hand. She should not die, so fair, so desperate At  least she should not   ####-die alone, unaided.       The face of their enemy was not turned towards him, but still he hardly  dared  to move,  dreading lest  the deadly eyes should fall  on him. Slowly,  slowly he began to crawl aside; but the Black  Captain, in doubt  and malice  intent upon the woman before him, heeded him no more than a worm in the  mud.       Suddenly the great beast beat its hideous  wings, and the  wind of them  was foul.  Again it  leaped into the  air, and then  swiftly fell  down upon  Jowyn, shrieking, striking with beak and claw.        Still  she  did  not blench:  maiden of  the Rohirrim, child of  kings,   slender but as a steel -blade, fair but terrible.  A  swift stroke she dealt,  skilled and deadly.  The outstretched neck she clove asunder,  and the  hewn  head fell like a stone.  Backward she sprang  as the huge  shape  crashed to  ruin, vast wings outspread,  crumpled on the  earth; and with  its fall  the  shadow passed  away. A light  fell about her,  and  her  hair  shone  in the  sunrise.       Out of the  wreck rose the Black  Rider, tall and threatening, towering  above her. With  a cry of hatred that stung the very ears  like venom he let  fall  his mace. Her  shield was  shivered  in  many pieces, and her  arm was  broken; she stumbled to her knees. He bent  over  her like  a cloud, and his  eyes glittered; he raised his mace to kill.       But suddenly he too stumbled forward with a cry of bitter pain, and his  stroke went  wide,  driving into the ground.  Merry's  sword had stabbed him  from behind, shearing  through  the black mantle, and passing up beneath the  hauberk had pierced the sinew behind his mighty knee.       'Jowyn! Jowyn!'  cried  Merry.  Then tottering, struggling up, with her   last strength she drove her sword between  crown and  mantle, as  the  great  shoulders bowed before her. The sword broke sparkling into many shards.  The  crown rolled away with  a clang. Jowyn fell forward upon her fallen foe. But  lo! the mantle and hauberk were empty. Shapeless they lay now on the ground,  torn and tumbled; and a cry went up into the shuddering air, and faded  to a   shrill wailing, passing with  the wind, a voice bodiless and thin that died,   and was swallowed up, and was never heard again in that age of this world.       And there stood Meriadoc the hobbit in the midst of the slain, blinking  like an owl in  the daylight, for  tears blinded him; and through  a mist he  looked on Jowyn's fair head, as  she lay and did not move; and  he looked on  the face of the king, fallen in the midst  of his glory, For Snowmane in his   ####-agony had rolled away from him again; yet he was the bane of his master.       Then  Merry stooped and  lifted his hand to kiss  it,  and  lo! Thjoden  opened  his eyes, and they were clear, and he spoke in a quiet voice  though   laboured.       'Farewell, Master Holbytla!'  he said. 'My body  is broken. I go to  my  fathers.  And  even  in their mighty  company  I shall not now be ashamed. I   felled the black serpent. A grim morn, and a glad day, and a golden sunset!'       Merry could  not speak, bu t wept anew."
