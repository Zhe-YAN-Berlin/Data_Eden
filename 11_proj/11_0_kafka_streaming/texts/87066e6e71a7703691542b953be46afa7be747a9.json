For  me time the three companions stood still  and silent, troubled  by this   ####-new stroke of ill fortune. They were under the eaves of Fangorn, and endless  leagues lay  between them and the Men of  Rohan,  their only friends in this  wide  and dangerous land. As they stood, it seemed to  them that they heard,   far off in the night. the sound of horses whinnying and  neighing. Then  all  was quiet again, except for the cold rustle of the wind.       'Well, they are gone,' said  Aragorn at last. 'We cannot  find  them or   catch  them;  so that  if they do not return of their  own will, we must  do  without. We started on our feet, and we have those still.'       'Feet!' said Gimli. 'But we cannot eat them as well  as walk on  them '  He threw some fuel on the fire and slumped down beside it.       'Only a few hours ago  you were unwilling  to sit on a horse of Rohan,'  laughed Legolas. 'You will make a rider yet.'       'It seems unlikely that I shall have the chance,' said Gimli.       'If you wish  to know what I think,'  he began  again after  a while 'I   think it was Saruman. Who else? Remember  the words of Jomer: he walks  about  like an old man hooded and cloaked. Those were  the words.  He has gone  off  with our horses, or scared them away, and here we are. There is more trouble  coming to us, mark my words!'       'I mark them,' said Aragorn. 'But I marked also that this old man had a   hat not a hood. Still I do not  doubt that  you guess right, and that we are  in peril here, by night or day. Yet in the meantime there is nothing that we  can do but  rest, while we may. I will  watch for a while now, Gimli. I have  more need of thought than of sleep.'       The night  passed  slowly. Legolas followed Aragorn, and Gimli followed  Legolas, and their watches wore away. But nothing  happened. The old man did  not appear again, and the horses did not return.     ####-   Chapter 3. The Uruk-Hai            Pippin lay in a dark and troubled dream:  it seemed that he could  hear  his own small  vo ice  echoing in black tunnels,  calling  Frodo, Frodo!  But  instead of Frodo hundreds of hideous  orc-faces grinned  at  him  out of the  shadows, hundreds of hideous arms grasped at him from  every side. Where  was  Merry?       He  woke. Cold air blew on his  face. He was lying on his back. Evening   was coming and  the sky above was growing dim. He turned and found that  the  dream  was little worse than  the  waking. His wrists, legs, and ankles were  tied with cords.  Beside him Merry lay,  white-faced, with a  dirty rag bound   across his brows. All about them sat or stood a great company of Orcs.       Slowly in Pippin's aching head memory pieced itself together and became  separated from dream-shadows. Of course: he and  Merry had run off into  the  woods. What had come over them? Why had they dashed off like that, taking  no  notice  of  old  Strider? They  had  run a  long  way shouting--he could not  remember how far or how long; and then suddenly they had crashed  right into  a  group  of Orcs: they  were standing listening, and they did not appear to  see Merry and Pippin until they were  almost in their arms. Then they yelled  and  dozens of other goblins had sprung out  of the  trees. Merry and he had  drawn their swords, but the  Orcs did not wish to fight, and had tried  only  to lay  hold of them, even when Merry had cut off several  of their arms and  hands. Good old Merry!        Then  Boromir  had come  leaping through  the  trees. He had made  them  fight. He slew many of them and the rest fled.  But they had not gone far on   the way back when they were attacked again. by a hundred Orcs at least, some  of  them very large, and they shot  a rain of  arrows:  always  at  Boromir.  Boromir had blown his great horn till the woods rang,  and at first the Orcs  had  been dismayed and  had  drawn back; but when no  answer but the  echoes  came, they had attacked more fierce  than ever. Pippin did not remember much  more.  His last memo was of Boromir  leaning against a tree, plucking out an  arrow; then darkness fell suddenly.       'I suppose I was knocked on the head,' he said to himself. 'I wonder if   ####-poor Merry is much hurt. What has happened to  Boromir? Why  didn't the  Orcs  kill us? Where are we, and where are we going?'       He could  not  answer the questions. He felt  cold and  sick.  'I  wish  Gandalf  had never persuaded Elrond to let  us come,' he thought. 'What good  have I been? Just a  nuisance: a  passenger, a piece  of luggage. And now  I  have been stolen  and I am  just  a piece of  luggage for the  Orcs.  I hope  Strider or someone will come and claim us! But ought I to hope for it? Won't  that throw out all the plans? I wish I could get free!'       He  struggled  a little, quite  uselessly. One of the Orcs sitting near  laughed and said something to a companion in their abominable  tongue."
