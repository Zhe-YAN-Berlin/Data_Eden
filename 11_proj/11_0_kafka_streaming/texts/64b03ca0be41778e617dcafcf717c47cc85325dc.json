Concerning Pipe-weed            There is another astonishing  thing about Hobbits of old  that must  be  mentioned, an astonishing habit: they imbibed  or inhaled, through pipes  of  clay or wood, the smoke of the burning leaves of  a herb, which they  called   pipe-weed or leaf, a variety  probably of Nicotiana. A great deal of mystery  surrounds the  origin  of this peculiar  custom,  or  'art' as  the  Hobbits  preferred to call it. All that could be discovered about it in antiquity was  put together by Meriadoc Brandybuck (later Master of Buckland), and since he  and  the   tobacco  of the Southfarthing  play  a part in  the  history  that  follows, his remarks in the introduction to his Herblore of the Shire may be  quoted.       'This,'  he says, 'is the one art that we can certainly claim to be our  own invention.  When  Hobbi ts  first began  to smoke  is not known,  all the   legends and family histories take it for granted; for ages folk in the Shire  smoked various herbs, some fouler, some sweeter. But all accounts agree that  Tobold Hornblower  of  Longbottom  in the Southfarthing first grew  the true  pipe-weed in his gardens in  the days of Isengrim the Second, about the year   1070 of Shire-reckoning. The best home-grown still comes from that district,  especially the  varieties  now  known  as Longbottom  Leaf,  Old  Toby,  and  Southern Star.       'How Old  Toby came by  the plant is not recorded, for to his dying day  he would not tell.  He knew much about herbs, but he was no traveller. It is  said that in his youth he went often to Bree, though he certainly never went  further fr om the Shire than that.  It is thus quite possible that he learned  of this plant in Bree, where now, at  any rate,  it grows well on  the south  slopes of the hill. The  Bree-hobbits  claim to have been the  first  actual  smokers of the pipe-weed.  They cla im,  of  course, to have done  everything   before the people of the Shire,  whom they refer  to as \"colonists\"; but  in  this case their claim is, I think,  likely to be true. And  certainly it was  from Bree  that the  art  of smoking  the genuine weed sprea d  in the recent  centuries among Dwarves and such other folk, Rangers, Wizards, or wanderers,   as still passed  to and fro through that  ancient road-meeting. The home and  centre of  the an is thus to be found in  the old inn of  Bree, The Prancing   ####-Pony, that has been kept by the family of Butterbur from time beyond record.       'All the same,  observations  that I have made on my own many  journeys  south have convinced me that the weed itself  is not  native to our parts of  the  world,  but  came  northward  from the lower Anduin, whither  it was, I  suspect, originally brought  over  Sea by the Men  of  Westernesse. It grows  abundantly  in  Gondor, and  there  is richer and  larger than in the North,  where it is never found wild, and flourishes  only in  warm sheltered places  like Longbottom. The Men of Gondor call it sweet galenas, and esteem it only  for the fragrance of its  flowers. From  that land it must have been carried  up the Greenway  during the long centuries between the coming of Elendil and  our own day.  But even the DÂ®nedain of  Gondor allow us this credit: Hobbits  first put it into pipes.  Not even the Wizards first thought of that  before  we did.  Though one Wizard that I knew took up the art long ago,  and became  as skilful in it as in all other things that he put his mind to.'   ####-   3. Of the Ordering of the Shire            The  Shire was  divided  into  four  quarters,  the  Farthings  already  referred to.  North,  South, East,  and  West;  and  these again each into a   number of folklands,  which still bore the names of some of  the old leading   families, although by the time  of this  history these names were no  longer  found only in their  proper folklands.  Nearly all Tooks  still lived in the  Tookland,  but that  was not  true  of  many  other  families,  such  as the  Bagginses  or  the Boffins.  Outside the  Farthings  were the  East and West  Marches:  the  Buckland  (see  beginning of Chapter  V,  Book  I);  and  the  Westmarch added to the Shire in S.R. 1462.       The Shire at  this time had hardly any 'government'. Families  for  the  most part  managed their  own affairs. Growing  food and eating  it occupied   most of their time. In  other matters they were, as a rule, generous and not  greedy, but  contented and moderate, so  that estates, farms, workshops, and  small trades tended to remain unchanged for generations.        There  remained,  of course, the  ancient tradition concerning the high  king at  Fornost, or Norbury as they called it, away north of the Shire. But  there had been no king for nearly  a thousand years,  and even the ruins  of  Kings' Norbury  were covered with grass. Yet the Hobbits  still said of wild  folk and wicked things (such as trolls) that they had not heard of the king.  For they attributed to the king of old all their essential laws; and usually  they kept the laws of free will, because they were The Rules (as they said),  both ancient and just."
