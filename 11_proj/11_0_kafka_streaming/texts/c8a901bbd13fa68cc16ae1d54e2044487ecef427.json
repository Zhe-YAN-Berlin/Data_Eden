THE QUEEN ACROSS THE WATER  DAENERYS TARGARYEN, called Daenerys Stormborn, the Unburnt, Mother of Dragons, Khaleesi of the Dothraki, and First of Her Name, sole surviving child of King Aerys II Targaryen by his sister/wife, Queen Rhaella, a widow at fourteen years,  —her new-hatched dragons, DROGON, VISERION, RHAEGAL,  —her brothers:    —{RHAEGAR}, Prince of Dragonstone and heir to the Iron Throne, slain by King Robert on the Trident,    —{RHAENYS}, Rhaegar’s daughter by Elia of Dorne, murdered during the Sack of King’s Landing,  —{AEGON}, Rhaegar’s son by Elia of Dorne, murdered during the Sack of King’s Landing,      —{VISERYS}, styling himself King Viserys, the Third of His Name, called the Beggar King, slain in Vaes Dothrak by the hand of Khal Drogo,    —her husband {DROGO}, a khal of the Dothraki, died of wounds gone bad,    —{RHAEGO}, stillborn son of Daenerys and Khal Drogo, slain in the womb by Mirri Maz Duur,    —her Queensguard:    —SER JORAH MORMONT, an exile knight, once Lord of Bear Island,  —JHOGO, ko and bloodrider, the whip,  —AGGO, ko and bloodrider, the bow,  —RAKHARO, ko and bloodrider, the arakh,    —her handmaids:    —IRRI, a Dothraki girl,  —JHIQUI, a Dothraki girl,  —DOREAH, a Lyseni slave, formerly a whore,    —the three seekers:    —XARO XHOAN DAXOS, a merchant prince of Qarth,  —PYAT PREE, a warlock of Qarth,  —QUAITHE, a masked shadowbinder of Asshai,    —ILLYRIO MOPATIS, a magister of the Free City of Pentos, who arranged to wed Daenerys to Khal Drogo and conspired to restore Viserys to the Iron Throne.      The banner of the Targaryens is the banner of Aegon the Conqueror, who conquered six of Seven Kingdoms, founded the dynasty, and made the Iron Throne from the swords of his conquered enemies: a three-headed dragon, red on black.      OTHER HOUSES GREAT  AND SMALL      HOUSE ARRYN  House Arryn declared for none of the rival claimants at the outbreak of the war, and kept its strength back to protect the Eyrie and the Vale of Arryn. The Arryn sigil is the moon-and-falcon, white, upon a sky-blue field. The Arryn words are As High As Honor.    ROBERT ARRYN, Lord of the Eyrie, Defender of the Vale, Warden of the East, a sickly boy of eight years,  —his mother, LADY LYSA, of House Tully, third wife and widow of {Lord Jon Arryn}, late Hand of the King, and sister to Catelyn Stark,  —his household:    —MAESTER COLEMON, counselor, healer, and tutor,  —SER MARWYN BELMORE, captain of guards,  —LORD NESTOR ROYCE, High Steward of the Vale,    —Lord Nestor’s son, SER ALBAR,  —MYA STONE, a bastard girl in his service, natural daughter of King Robert,      —MORD, a brutal gaoler,  —MARILLION, a young singer,    —his lords bannermen, suitors, and retainers:    —LORD YOHN ROYCE, called BRONZE YOHN,    —Lord Yohn’s eldest son, SER ANDAR,  —Lord Yohn’s second son, SER ROBAR, in service to King Renly, Robar the Red of the Rainbow Guard,  —Lord Yohn’s youngest son, {SER WAYMAR}, a man of the Night’s Watch, lost beyond the Wall,      —LORD NESTOR ROYCE, brother of Lord Yohn, High Steward of the Vale,    —Lord Nestor’s son and heir, SER ALBAR,  —Lord Nestor’s daughter, MYRANDA,      —SER LYN CORBRAY, a suitor to Lady Lysa,    —MYCHEL REDFORT, his squire,      —LADY ANYA WAYNWOOD,    —Lady Anya’s eldest son and heir, SER MORTON, a suitor to Lady Lysa,  —Lady Anya’s second son, SER DONNEL, the Knight of the Gate,      —EON HUNTER, Lord of Longbow Hall, an old man, and a suitor to Lady Lysa.      HOUSE FLORENT  The Florents of Brightwater Keep are sworn bannermen to Highgarden, and followed the Tyrells in declaring for King Renly. They also kept a foot in the other camp, however, since Stannis’s queen is a Florent, and her uncle the castellan of Dragonstone. The sigil of House Florent shows a fox head in a circle of flowers.    ALESTER FLORENT, Lord of Brightwater,  —his wife, LADY MELARA, of House Crane,  —their children:    —ALEKYNE, heir to Brightwater,  —MELESSA, wed to Lord Randyll Tarly,  —RHEA, wed to Lord Leyton Hightower,    —his siblings:    —SER AXELL, castellan of Dragonstone,  —{SER RYAM}, died in a fall from a horse,    —Ser Ryam’s daughter, QUEEN SELYSE, wed to King Stannis,  —Ser Ryam’s eldest son and heir, SER IMRY,  —Ser Ryam’s second son, SER ERREN,      —SER COLIN,    —Colin’s daughter, DELENA, wed to SER HOSMAN NORCROSS,      —Delena’s son, EDRIC STORM, a bastard fathered by King Robert,  —Delena’s son, ALESTER NORCROSS,  —Delena’s son, RENLY NORCROSS,      —Colin’s son, MAESTER OMER, in service at Old Oak,  —Colin’s son, MERRELL, a squire on the Arbor,      —his sister, RYLENE, wed to Ser Rycherd Crane.      HOUSE FREY  Powerful, wealthy, and numerous, the Freys are bannermen to House Tully, their swords sworn to the service of Riverrun, but they have not always been diligent in performing their duty. When Robert Baratheon met Rhaegar Targaryen on the Trident, the Freys did not arrive until the battle was done, and thereafter Lord Hoster Tully always called Lord Walder  the Late Lord Frey."
