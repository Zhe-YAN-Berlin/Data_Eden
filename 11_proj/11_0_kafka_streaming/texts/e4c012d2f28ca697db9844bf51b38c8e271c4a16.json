But  soon they  began to fall down into the darkness, and as the sun  turned  west a  grey shadow crept over  their faces. But Faramir burned with a fever   that would not abate.       Gandalf  went  from one to the other full of care, and he was told  all  that the watchers could hear. And so  the day passed, while the great battle  outside went on with shifting  hopes and strange  tidings; and still Gandalf  waited and watched and did not  go forth; till at last the red sunset filled  all the sky, and the light through the windows fell on the grey faces of the   sick.  Then  it seemed to those  who  stood by that  in the glow  the  faces  flushed softly as with health returning, but it was only a mockery of hope.       Then an old  wife, Ioreth, the eldest  of the women who  served in that  house, looking on the fair  face  of Faramir, wept, for all the people loved  him. And  she said: 'Alas! if he should die. Would that there  were kings in  Gondor , as there were once  upon a time,  they  say! For  it is said in  old  lore: The hands of the king  are  the hands of a healer. And so the rightful   ####-king could ever be known.'       And Gandalf,  who  stood by, said:  'Men  may long remember your words,   Ioreth! For  there  is hope  in them. Maybe a king has  indeed  returned  to  Gondor; or  have  you not  heard the strange tidings that  have come to  the  City?'       'I  have been  too busy with this and that  to  heed all the crying and  shouting,' she answered. 'All  I hope is that those murdering devils  do not  come to this House and trouble the sick.'       Then Gandalf went  out in haste, and already  the fire  in  the sky was  burning out, and the smouldering  hills were  fading, while ash-grey evening  crept over the fields.        Now  as  the sun went down  Aragorn and Jomer and Imrahil drew near the  City  with their captains and knights; and  when they came  before the  Gate  Aragorn said:       'Behold the  Sun setting in  a  great fire! It is a sign of the end and  fall of many things, and a change in the tides of  the world.  But this City  and realm has rested in the charge of the  Stewards for many long years, and  I  fear that if I enter it unbidden, then doubt and debate may  arise, which  should not be while this war is  fought.  I will not enter in, nor  make any  claim, until  it be seen whether we or Mordor shall prevail. Men shall pitch  my tents upon  the field,  and here  I will await the welcome of the Lord of  the City.'       But Jomer  said: 'Already you have raised the banner  of the Kings  and  displayed  the  tokens  of  Elendil's  House.  Will you suffer  these to  be  challenged?'       'No,' said Aragorn. 'But I deem the time unripe; and I have no mind for  strife except with our Enemy and his servants. '       And the Prince  Imrahil said. Your words, lord, are wise, if one who is  a kinsman of  the  Lord Denethor  may counsel  you  in  this  matter. He  is  strong-willed  and proud, but old; and  his mood has been strange  since his  son was stricken down. Yet I would not have  you remain like a beggar at the  door.'       'Not  a beggar,' said Aragorn. 'Say a captain  of the Rangers, who  are  unused to  cities and  houses of  stone.' And he commanded  that  his banner   should be furled;  and he did off the Star of the  North Kingdom and gave it  to the keeping of the sons of Elrond.       Then the Prince Imrahil and Jomer of Rohan left him and passed  through   ####-the City and the tumult of the people,  and mounted to the Citadel; and they  came to the Hall of the Tower, seeking the Steward. But they found his chair  empty, and before the dais lay Thjoden King of the Mark upon a bed of state;  and twelve torches stood about it, and twelve  guards, knights both of Rohan  and Gondor. And the hangings  of  the bed were of  green and white, but upon  the king  was laid the great cloth  of gold up  to his breast, and upon that  his  unsheathed sword, and at his  feet his shield, The light of the torches  shimmered in  his  white hair like  sun in the spray of a fountain,  but his  face  was fair  and young, save that  a peace lay on it beyond the reach  of  youth; and it seemed that he slept.       When they had stood silent  for a time  beside  the king, Imrahil said:  'Where is the Steward? And where also is Mithrandir?'       And one of the guards answered: 'The Steward of Gondor is in the Houses  of Healing.'       But  Jomer said: 'Where is the  Lady Jowyn,  my sister; for surely  she  should be lying beside the  king, and  in no  less  honour? Where  have they  bestowed her?'       And Imrahil said: 'But the Lady Jowyn was yet living when they bore her   hither. Did you not know?'       Then hope unlooked-for came so  suddenly to Jomer's  heart, and with it  the bite of care and fear renewed, that he said no more, but turned and went  swiftly from the hall; and the Prince followed him."
