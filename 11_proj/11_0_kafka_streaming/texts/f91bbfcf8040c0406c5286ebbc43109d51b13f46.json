But  always  they  found its  outward faces  sheer,  high  and  impassable, frowning  over  the plain  below;  beyond its  tumbled skirts lay livid festering marshes where nothing moved and not  even  a bird was to be seen.       The hobbits stood now on the brink of a tall cliff, bare and bleak, its  feet wrapped in mist; and behind them rose the broken highlands crowned with  drifting  cloud. A chill wind` blew from the East. Night was gathering  over   the shapeless  lands before them; the sickly  green of them was fading  to a   sullen brown. Far away to the right the Anduin, that had gleamed fitfully in  sun-breaks during the day, was now  hidden in shadow. But their eyes did not  look beyond the  River,  back to Gondor, to  their friends, to the lands  of  Men. South and east they stared to where, at the edge of the oncoming night,   a dark line hung, like distant mountains  of motionless smoke. Every now and  again a  tiny red gleam far away  flickered upwards on the rim of earth  and  sky.       `What a fix! ' said Sam.  `That's the one place  in all the lands we've  ever heard of that we  don't want to see any closer; and that's the one place  we're trying  to  get  to! And  that's just where we can't get, nohow. We've  come the wrong way altogether, seemingly. We can't get down;  and if  we did   ####-get down, we'd find all that green land a nasty bog, I'll warrant. Phew! Can  you smell it?' He sniffed at the wind.       'Yes, I can smell  it,'  said Frodo, but he did not move,  and his eyes  remained fixed, staring out towards the  dark line and the flickering flame.  `Mordor! ' he muttered under his breath. 'If I  must go there I wish I could  come there quickly and make an  end! ' He shuddered. The wind was chilly and  yet heavy with an odour of cold decay.  `Well,' he said, at last withdrawing  his eyes, `we cannot stay here all night, fix or no fix. We must find a more  sheltered spot,  and camp once more; and perhaps another  day will show us a  path.'       'Or another and another and another,' muttered Sam.  `Or  maybe no day.   We've come the wrong way.'       'I wonder,' said Frodo. 'It's my  doom, I think, to go  to  that Shadow  yonder, so that a way will  be found.  But will good or evil show it to  me?   What hope we had was in speed. Delay plays into the Enemy's hands-and here I  am: delayed. Is it the will of the Dark Tower that steers us? All my choices  have proved ill. I should have  left the Company long  before, and come down  from the North, east of the River and of the Emyn Muil, and so over the hard  of Battle Plain  to the passes of Mordor. But now it isn't possible  for you   and me alone to find a way back, and the Orcs are prowling on the east bank.  Every  day that passes is a precious day lost. I am tired, Sam. I don't know  what is to be done. What food have we got left?'       'Only those, what d'you call 'em, lembas, Mr. Frodo. A fair supply. But  they are better than naught, by a long bite. I never thought, though, when I  first set tooth in them, that I should ever come to wish for a change. But I  do now: a bit of plain bread, and a mug -- aye, half  a mug  -- of beer would  go down proper. I've lugged my cooking-gear all the way from the last  camp,  and what use  has  it been? Naught  to  make a fire with, for  a start;  and  naught to cook, not even grass!'       They turned  away and went down into a  stony hollow. The westering sun  was caught into clouds,  and night came swiftly. They slept as  well as they  could  for the  cold, turn and  turn about,  in a  nook among  great  jagged  pinnacles of weathered rock; at  least they were sheltered from the easterly  wind.       `Did you see them  again, Mr . Frodo?' asked Sam, as they sat, stiff and  chilled, munching wafers of  lembas, in the cold grey of early morning.       'No,' said Frodo. `I've heard nothing, and seen nothing, for two nights   ####-now.'       `Nor me,' said  Sam. `Grrr!  Those eyes did give me a  turn! But perhaps  we've shaken  him off at  last, the miserable slinker. Gollum! I'll give him  gollum in his throat, if ever I get my hands on his neck.'       'I  hope  you'll never need to,'  said  Frodo.  `I don't  know  how  he  followed us; but it may be that  he's lost us again, as you say. In this dry  bleak  land we  can't leave  many  footprints, nor much scent, even  for his  snuffling nose.'       'I hope that's the way of it,' said Sam. 'I wish we could be rid of him  for good!'       'So do I,' said Frodo; 'but he's not my chief trouble. I wish we  could  get away from these hills! I hate them. I feel all naked on  the  east side,  stuck up here with  nothing but  the  dead  flats between me and that Shadow  yonder. There's an Eye in it. Come on! We've got to get down today somehow.'       But  that day wore on, and  when  afternoon faded towards evening  they  were still scrambling along the ridge and had found no way of escape."
