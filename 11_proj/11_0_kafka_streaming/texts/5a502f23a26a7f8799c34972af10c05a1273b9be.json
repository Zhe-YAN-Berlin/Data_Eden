But  close under the cliff  there  stood,  still strong and  living,  . two  tall  trees, larger than any trees of holly that Frodo  had ever seen or imagined.   ####-Their  great  roots spread  from the  wall to the  water. Under the   looming  cliffs  they had looked like mere bushes, when seen  far off from the top of  the Stair; but now they  towered overhead, stiff, dark, and silent, throwing  deep night-shadows about their feet,  standing  like sentinel pillars at the  end of the road.       `Well, here  we are at last!  ' said  Gandalf. 'Here the Elven-way from  Hollin ended. Holly  was  the  token  of the  people of that land, and  they  planted it here to mark the end of their  domain; for the West -door was made  chiefly for their  use in their traffic with the Lords of Moria. Those  were  happier days, when there was still close friendship at times between folk of  different race, even between Dwarves and Elves.'       'It was not  the fault of the Dwarves that the friendship  waned,' said  Gimli.       'I have not heard that it was the fault of the Elves,' said Legolas.       'I have heard both,' said Gandalf; 'and I will not give judgement  now.  But I beg you two, Legolas  and Gimli, at least  to  be friends, and to help  me. I need you  both.  The  doors are shut and hidden, and the sooner we find   them the better. Night is at hand! '       Turning to  the others he said:  'While I  am  searching, will you each  make ready to enter the  Mines? For here I fear we  must say farewell to our   good  bea st of burden. You must lay aside much  of the stuff that we brought  against  bitter weather:  you will  not need it inside, nor, I hope, when we  come through  and journey on down  into the South.  Instead each of us  must   take  a  share  of  what  the pony   carried,  especially  the food  and  the  water -skins.'       'But you can't  leave poor old Bill behind in this forsaken  place, Mr.  Gandalf! ' cried Sam,  angry and  distressed.  `I won't have  it, and that's  flat. After he has come so far and all! '       'I am sorry, Sam,'  said the wizard. `But when the  Door opens I do not  think  you will  be able  to  drag your Bill  inside, into  the long dark of  Moria. You will have to choose between Bill and your master.'       'He'd  follow Mr. Frodo into  a dragon's  den, if I led him,' protested  Sam.  `It'd  be nothing short  of murder  to turn  him loose with  all these  wolves about.'       'It will be short of murder, I hope,' said Gandalf. He laid his hand on  the pony's head, and spoke  in  a  low voice. `Go with  words  of  guard and  guiding on you,' he said. `You are a wise  beast, and  have  learned much in   ####-Rivendell. Make your ways to places where you can find grass, and so come in  time to Elrond's house, or wherever you wish to go.       `There, Sam! He will have quite as  much chance of escaping wolves  and  getting home as we have.'       Sam stood sullenly by the pony and returned no answer. Bill, seeming to   understand well what  was going on, nuzzled up to  him,  putting his nose to  Sam's  ear. Sam burst into tears, and  fumbled with the straps, unlading all  the pony's packs and throwing them on the ground. The others  sorted out the  goods, making a  pile of all that could be left behind,  and dividing up the  rest.       When this was  done  they turned to watch Gandalf. He  appeared to have  done nothing. He was standing between the two trees gazing at the blank wall  of the cliff, as if he  would bore a hole  into it  with his eyes. Gimli was  wandering about, tapping the stone here  and there with his axe. Legolas was  pressed against the rock, as if listening.       'Well, here  we are and all ready,'  said  Merry;  `but  where  are the  Doors? I can't see any sign of them.'       'Dwarf-doors are  not made to be seen when shut,' said Gimli. `They are  invisible, and their own  masters cannot  find them or  open them,  if their  secret is forgotten.'       'But this Door was not made to be a secret known only to Dwarves,' said  Gandalf, coming  suddenly to  life and turning  round.  `Unless  things  are  altogether changed, eyes that know what to look for may discover the signs.'       He walked forward  to the wall. Right  between the shadow  of the trees  there  was a smooth space,  and over this he passed  his  hands to and  fro,  muttering words under his breath. Then he stepped back.       'Look!' he said. `Can you see anything now?'       The Moon  now shone upon the grey face of the  rock; but they could see  nothing else for a  while.  Then slowly on the surface, where  the  wizard's  hands had passed, faint lines appeared, like slender veins of silver running  in the stone. At first they were no more than pale gossamer -threads, so fine  that they only twinkled fitfully where the Moon  caught  them,  but steadily  they grew broader and clearer, until their design could be guessed."
