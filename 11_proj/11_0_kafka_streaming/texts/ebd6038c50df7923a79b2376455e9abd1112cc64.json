' he said aloud. `Your legs are too short, so  use  your head! Let me  see now! Boromir isn't lying, that's not  his way; but he  hasn't  told  us everything. Something scared Mr.  Frodo  badly.  He screwed  himself up  to the point,  sudden. He made up his mind  at last to go. Where  to? Off East. Not without Sam? Yes, without even his Sam. That's hard, cruel  hard.'       Sam passed his hand over  his eyes, brushing  away the  tears. 'Steady,  Gamgee!  ' he said. `Think,  if you can!  He can't fly across rivers, and he  can't  jump  waterfalls. He's got no gear. So he's  got  to get back to  the  boats. Back to the boats! Back to the boats, Sam, like lightning!  '       Sam turned and bolted back down the path. He fell and cut his knees. Up  he  got and ran on.  He  came to the edge of the lawn of Parth Galen  by the  shore, where the boats were  drawn up out  of the  water.  No one was there.   There  seemed to be cries in  the woods behind, but he did not heed them. He  stood gazing for a moment. stock -still, gaping.  A boat was sliding down the   ####-bank  all by itself.  With  a shout Sam raced  across  the  grass. The  boat  slipped into the wat    128d    er.       `Coming, Mr. Frodo!  Coming! ' called  Sam, and flung himself  from the  bank, clutching at the departing boat. He missed it by a  yard. With  a  cry  and a  splash he fell face  downward into deep swift water. Gurgling he went  under, and the River closed over his curly head.       An exclamation of dismay came from the empty boat. A paddle swirled and  the boat put about. Frodo was  just  in time to grasp Sam by  the hair as he  came up, bubbling and struggling. Fear was staring in his round brown eyes.        `Up you come, Sam my lad! ' said Frodo. `Now take my hand! '       `Save me, Mr. Frodo! ' gasped Sam.  `I'm  drownded.  I can't  see  your  hand.'       `Here it is. Don't  pinch, lad! I  won't  let you  go. Tread water  and  don't flounder, or  you'll upset the boat. There now, get hold of  the side,  and let me use the paddle! '       With a few strokes Frodo brought the boat back to the bank. and Sam was  able to scramble out, wet  as a  water -rat.  Frodo  took off  the  Ring  and  stepped ashore again.       `Of all the confounded nuisances you are the worst, Sam! ' he said.       'Oh, Mr. Frodo, that's hard! ' said Sam shivering. `That's hard, trying  to  go without me and all. If I hadn't a guessed right, where  would you  be  now?  '       `Safely on my way.'       `Safely! ' said Sam. `All alone and without me to help you? I  couldn't   have a borne it, it'd have been the death of me.'       'It would be the death of you to come  with me, Sam,' said  Frodo and I  could not have borne that.'       `Not as certain as being left behind,' said Sam.       `But I am going to Mordor.'       `I know that well enough, Mr. Frodo. Of course  you are. And I'm coming  with you.'       `Now, Sam,'  said Frodo, `don't  hinder me!  The  others will be coming  back  at any  minute.  If  they  ca tch me here. I  shall have  to argue  and   ####-explain, and I shall never have  the heart  or  the chance to get off. But I  must go at once. It's the only way.'       `Of course  it is,' answered  Sam.  'But not alone. I'm  coming too, or   neither of us isn't going. I'll knock holes in all the boats first.'       Frodo actually laughed. A sudden warmth and gladness touched his heart.  `Leave one! 'he said. `We'll need it. But you  can't come like  this without  your gear or food or anything.'       'Just  hold on a moment, and  I'll  get my stuff!' cried  Sam  eagerly.  'It's all ready. I thought we should be off today.' He rushed to the camping  place,  fished out  his pack from the pile where Frodo had laid it  when  he  emptied the boat of his companions' goods grabbed a  spare blanket, and some  extra packages of food, and ran back.       `So all my  plan is spoilt!  ' said Frodo.  `It is  no good  trying  to  escape you. But I'm glad, Sam. I cannot tell you how glad. Come along! It is  plain that we were meant to go together. We will go, and may the others find  a safe road! Strider will look after them. I don't suppose we shall see them  again.'       `Yet we may, Mr Frodo. We may,' said Sam.       So Frodo and Sam set off on the last stage of the Quest together. Frodo  paddled away from the shore, and the River  bore them swiftly away. down the  western arm, and past  the frowning cliffs  of Tol  Brandir. The roar of the  great falls drew nearer. Even with such help  as Sam could give, it was hard  work to pass across the current at the southward end of the island and drive  the boat eastward towards the far shore.       At  length  they  came to land  again  upon the southern slopes of Amon  Lhaw. There  they found a shelving shore, and they  drew the  boat out, high  above the water ,  and hid it as well  as  they could behind a great boulder."
