'Hoom, hm, ah  well.'  He paused,  looking long at the hobbits: 'Hoom, ah, well I do not know what to say. Come  now!'   ####-     'If you  would like to hear more. said Merry, 'we will tell you. But it  will take some time. Wouldn't you like to put us  down? Couldn't we sit here  together in the sun, while it lasts? You must be getting tired of holding us  up.'       'Hm,  tired? No. I am not tired. I do not easily get tired. And I do not  sit down. I am not very. hm, bendable. But there.  the  Sun is  going in. Let  us leave this  -- did you say what you call it?'       'Hill?' suggested Pippin. 'Shelf? Step?' suggested Merry.       Treebeard repeated the words thoughtfully. 'Hill. Yes, that was it. But  it is a hasty word  for  a thing that has stood here ever since this part of  the world was shaped. Never mind. Let us leave it, and go.'       'Where shall we go?' asked Merry.       'To my home, or one of my homes,' answered Treebeard.       'Is it far?'       'I do not  know.  You might  call it far, perhaps.  But what does  tha t  matter?'       'Well,  you see, we have lost all our belongings,' said Merry. 'We have  only a little food.'       'O!  Hm! You need not  trouble about that,' said Treebeard. 'I can give  you a drink that will keep you green and growing for a long, long while. And  if we decide to part company, I can  set you down outside my  country at any  point you choose. Let us go!'       Holding the hobbits gently but firmly, one  in  the crook of each  arm,  Treebeard lifted up first one large foot and then the  other, and  moved them  to the  edge  of  the  shelf. The  rootlike  toes grasped  the  rocks.  Then  carefully  and solemnly, he  stalked down from step to step, and reached the  floor of the Forest.       At once he set off with  long  deliberate strides  through  the  trees,  deeper  and  deeper into  the  wood, never  far  from  the  stream, climbing  steadily up  towards  the slopes of the mountains. Many of the  trees seemed  asleep, or as unaware of him as of any other creature that merely passed by;   but  some quivered, and some  raised up  their branches above his head as he  approached.  All  the  while, as he walked, he  talked to  himself in a long  running stream of musical sounds.        The hobbits  were silent for some time. They  felt, oddly  enough, safe  and  comfortable, and they had a great deal  to think and wonder  about.  At   last Pippin ventured to speak again.   ####-     'Please, Treebeard,' he said,  'could I  ask  you  something?  Why  did  Celeborn  warn  us  against  your forest?  He  told us  not to  risk getting  entangled in it.'       'Hmm,  did he now?' rumbled  Treebeard. 'And I might have said much the  same, if you had been going the other way. Do  not risk getting entangled in  the  woods of  Laurelindurenan ! That  is what the Elves used to call it, but  now they  make the  name  shorter: Lothlurien they call it. Perhaps they are  right: maybe it is fading;  not growing. Land of the Valley of Singing Gold,  that was it, once upon a time. Now it is the Dreamflower. Ah well! But it is  a queer  place, and  not for just any one to venture in. I am surprised that  you ever got out, but much more surprised that you ever got in: that has not  happened to strangers for many a year. It is a queer land.       'And  so is  this. Folk have  come  to grief here. Aye, they  have ,  to  grief.  Laurelindurenan lindelorendor malinornjlion ornemalin ,' he hummed to  himself. 'They are falling rather  behind  the world in  there, I guess,' he  said 'Neither  this country, nor anything else  outside the Golden  Wood, is  what it was when Celeborn was young. Still:       Taurelilumla-tumbalemorna Tumbaletaurla Lumlanor,1       that is what  they used to say.  Things have  changed, but it is  still  true in places.'       'What do you mean?' said Pippin. 'What is true?'       'The trees and the Ents,' said Treebeard. 'I do not understand all that  goes  on myself, so I cannot explain it  to  you. Some of us are  still true  Ents, and  lively enough  in our fashion, but many are growing sleepy, going  tree-ish, as you might say. Most of the trees are ju st trees, of course; but  many are half  awake. Some  are quite wide awake, and a  few are,  well, ah,   well getting Entish. That is going on all the time.       'When that happens to  a  tree,  you find that  some have  bad  hearts.   Nothing to do with their wood: I do not mean that. Why, I knew some good old  willows  down  the Entwash, gone  long ago,  alas!  They were  quite hollow,  indeed  they were falling all to pieces, but as quiet and  sweet-spoken as a   young  leaf.  And  then  there are  some  trees  in  the  valleys  under the  mountains, sound as a bell, and bad right through.  That sort of thing seems  to spread. There used to be some very dangerous parts in this country."
