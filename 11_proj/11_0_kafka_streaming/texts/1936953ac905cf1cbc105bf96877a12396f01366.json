  "text": " We want to go with Frodo.'       `That  is  because  you do not understand a nd cannot imagine what  lies  ahead,' said Elrond.       `Neither  does Frodo,'  said  Gandalf,  unexpectedly supporting Pippin.  'Nor do  any of us see clearly. It is true that  if these hobbits understood  the danger, they would  not dare to go. But they wou ld  still wish to go, or   wish that  they dared, and be shamed  and unhappy.  I think, Elrond, that in  this matter it  would be well to  trust  rather  to their friendship than to  great wisdom. Even if you chose for us an elf-lord,  such as  Glorfindel, he  could not storm the Dark Tower, nor open the road  to the Fire by the  power  that is in him.'       `You  speak  gravely,'  said Elrond, `but  I am in doubt. The Shire,  I  forebode,  is not free now from peril;  and these two I had thought to  send   ####-back there as messengers, to do what they could, according to the fashion of  their country, to warn the people of their danger. In any case, I judge that  the younger of these two, Peregrin Took,  should remain. My heart is against  his going.'       `Then, Master Elrond, you will have to  lock  me in prison,  or send me  home  tied in  a  sack,'  said  Pippin. `For  otherwise  I shall follow  the  Company.'       `Let it be so then. You shall go,' said Elrond, and he sighed. 'Now the  tale of Nine is filled. In seven days the Company must depart.'       The Sword of Elendil was forged anew by Elvish smiths, and on its blade  was traced  a device  of seven  stars set between the crescent Moon and  the  rayed Sun,  and  about  them  was written  many  runes; for  Aragorn son  of  Arathorn  was going to war upon the marches of Mordor. Very bright was  that  sword  when it was made whole again; the light of the sun shone redly in it,  and the light of the  moon shone cold, and its edge  was hard and  keen. And  Aragorn gave it a new name and called it And®ril, Flame of the West.       Aragorn and Gandalf walked together  or sat speaking of  their road and  the  perils they  would meet; and they pondered the storied and figured maps  and books of lore that were in the house of Elrond. Sometimes Frodo was with  them; but  he was content to  lean on their guidance,  and he spent  as much  time as he could with Bilbo.       In those  last days the hobbits sat together in the evening in the Hall  of Fire, and there among many tales they heard told in full the lay of Beren  and L®thien and the winning of the  Great Jewel; but in the day, while Merry  and Pippin were out and about, Frodo and Sam were  to be found with Bilbo in  his  own small  room.  Then Bilbo would  read  passages from his book (which  still seemed very incomplete). or scraps of his verses, or  would take notes  of Frodo's adventures.        On the morning of the last day Frodo  was alone with Bilbo, and the old  hobbit  pulled  out from under his bed a wooden box.  He lifted  the lid and  fumbled inside.       'Here  is your sword,' he said. 'But it was broken, you know. I took it  to  keep it safe but I've  forgotten to ask if the smiths  could mend it. No  time now..  So I thought, perhaps,  you would care to have this,  don't  you   know?'       He took from the box  a small sword in an old shabby leathern scabbard.   Then he drew it, and  its polished and well -tended blade glittered suddenly,   ####-cold  and bright. 'This is Sting,' he said, and thrust it with little effort  deep into a wooden beam. `Take it, if  you like.  I shan't want  it again, I  expect.'       Frodo accepted it gratefully.       'Also there is this!' said Bilbo, bringing out a parcel which seemed to  be rather  heavy for  its size. He unwound several folds of  old cloth,  and  held up a  small shirt of  mail. It was close-woven of many  rings, as supple  almost as linen, cold as ice,  and  harder than steel. It shone like moonlit  silver,  and  was studded  with white gems. With it  was a belt of pearl and  crystal.       'It's  a pretty thing,  isn't it?'  said Bilbo, moving it in the light.  `And  useful.  It  is my dwarf-mail that  Thorin gave me. I got it back from  Michel Delving before I started,  and packed  it with my  luggage: I brought   all the mementoes of my Journey away with me, except the Ring. But I did not  expect to use this, and I don't need it  now, except to  look  at sometimes.  You hardly feel any weight when you put it on.'       `I  should look -- well, I don't think I should look right in it,' said  Frodo.       `Just what I sa id myself,' said Bilbo. 'But never mind about looks. You   can wear it under your  outer clothes.  Come  on! You must share this secret   with me. Don't tell anybody else! But I should  feel happier  if I knew  you   were wearing it.  I have a fancy it would turn even the  knives of the Black   Riders,' he ended in a low voice.       `Very  well, I will take  it,' said  Frodo. Bilbo  put  it  on him, and  fastened Sting upon the glittering belt; and then Frodo put over the top his  old weather -stained breeches, tunic, and jacket."
