Pippin stopped.       'I know these fields and this gate!' he said. 'This is Bamfurlong,  old  Farmer Maggot's land. That's his farm away there in the trees.'       'One trouble after  another!' said Frodo, looking nearly as much alarmed  as if Pippin  had declared the lane was the slot leading to  a dragon's den.  The others looked at him in surprise.       'What's wrong with  old Maggot?' asked Pippin.  'He's a good  friend to  all the  Brandy  bucks.  Of course he's  a terror to trespassers, and  keeps  ferocious  dogs  - but after all, folk down here are near the border and have  to be more on their guard.'       'I  know,' said  Frodo. 'But all the same,' he added with  a shamefaced  laugh,  'I am  terrified of  him and his dogs. I have avoided  his  farm for   years and  years. He  caught me  several times trespassing after  mushrooms,   when I was a youngster at Brandy Hall. On the last occasion he beat  me, and  then took  me  and showed  me to his dogs. \"See, lads,\" he  said, \"next time  this young varmint sets foot on my land, you can eat  him. Now see him off!\"  They chased me all the way to the Ferry. I have never got over the  fright  -  though I  daresay  the beasts knew their business and  would not really have  touched me.'       Pippin laughed. 'Well, it's time you  made it up. Especially if you are  coming back to live  in Buckland. Old Maggot is really  a stout fellow -  if  you leave his mushrooms alone. Let's get into the lane and then we shan't be  trespassing. If we meet him, I'll do the talking. He is a friend of Merry's,   and I used to come here with him a good deal at one time.'       They went along the lane, until they saw the  thatched roofs of a large  house and farm-buildings peeping ou t among the trees ahead. The Maggots,  and  the Puddifoots of  Stock, and most of  the  inhabitants of  the Marish, were   ####-house-dwellers; and this farm was stoutly built of brick and had a high wall  all round it. There was a wide wooden gate opening out of the  wall into the   lane.       Suddenly  as they drew nearer  a terrific baying and barking broke out,  and a loud voice was heard shouting: 'Grip! Fang! Wolf! Come on, lads!'       Frodo and Sam stopped dead, but Pippin walked  on a few paces. The gate  opened and  three  huge dogs came  pelting  out  into  the  lane, and dashed  towards the travellers, barking fiercely. They took no notice of Pippin; but  Sam shrank  against the wall, while  two wolvish-looking dogs sniffed at him  suspiciously, and snarled if he moved. The largest and most ferocious of the  three halted in front of Frodo, bristling and growling.       Through the gate there now appeared  a broad  thick -set  hobbit  with a   round  red  face. 'Hallo! Hallo!  And who may you  be, and what  may you  be  wanting?' he asked.       'Good afternoon, Mr. Maggot!' said Pippin.       The farmer looked at  him closely. 'Well, if it  isn't Master Pippin   -  Mr. Peregrin Took, I should say!' he cried, changing from a scowl to a grin.  'It's a long time since I saw you round here. It's lucky for you that I know  you. I was just going out to  set my dogs  on  any strangers. There are some  funny things going  on today. Of course, we do get queer folk  wandering  in   these parts at times. Too near the River,' he said, shaking his  head.  'But  this fellow was the most outlandish I have ever set eyes  on. He won't cross  my land without leave a second time, not if I can stop it.'       'What fellow do you mean?' asked Pippin.       'Then you haven't  seen him?' said  the  farmer. 'H e  went up the  lane  towards the  causeway not  a  long while back. He  was a funny  customer and  asking funny questions. But perhaps you'll come along inside, and we'll pass  the news more comfortable. I've a  drop  of good ale on tap, if you and your   friends are willing, Mr. Took.'       It seemed plain that the  farmer would tell them more, if allowed to do  it in his own time and  fashion, so they all accepted  the invitation. 'What  about the dogs?' asked Frodo anxiously.       The farmer laughed.  'They  won't harm you - not unless I  tell 'em to.  Here, Grip! Fang! Heel!' he cried. 'Heel, Wolf!'  To the relief of Frodo and  Sam, the dogs walked away and let them go free.       Pippin introduced  the other two to the farmer. 'Mr. Frodo Baggins,' he  said.  'You may not remember him, but he used to live at Brandy Hall.' At the   ####-name Baggins the farmer started, and gave Frodo a sharp glance. For a moment  Frodo thought that the memory of stolen mushrooms had been aroused, and  that  the dogs would be  told  to see him   off. But Farmer Maggot took him by  the  arm.       'Well, if that isn't queerer than ever?'  he exclaimed. 'Mr. Baggins is  it? Come inside! We must have a talk.'       They went  into the farmer's  kitchen, and sat by  the wide fire-place."
