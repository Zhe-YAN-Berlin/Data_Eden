Tyrion had no more strength than a rag doll. Ser Mandon put the point of his sword to the hollow of his throat and curled both hands around the hilt.  And suddenly he lurched to the left, staggering into the rail. Wood split, and Ser Mandon Moore vanished with a shout and a splash. An instant later, the hulls came slamming together again, so hard the deck seemed to jump. Then someone was kneeling over him.  Jaime?  he croaked, almost choking on the blood that filled his mouth. Who else would save him, if not his brother?   Be still, my lord, you’re hurt bad.  A boy’s voice, that makes no sense, thought Tyrion. It sounded almost like Pod.      SANSA  When Ser Lancel Lannister told the queen that the battle was lost, she turned her empty wine cup in her hands and said,  Tell my brother, ser.  Her voice was distant, as if the news were of no great interest to her.   Your brother’s likely dead.  Ser Lancel’s surcoat was soaked with the blood seeping out under his arm. When he had arrived in the hall, the sight of him had made some of the guests scream.  He was on the bridge of boats when it broke apart, we think. Ser Mandon’s likely gone as well, and no one can find the Hound. Gods be damned, Cersei, why did you have them fetch Joffrey back to the castle? The gold cloaks are throwing down their spears and running, hundreds of them. When they saw the king leaving, they lost all heart. The whole Blackwater’s awash with wrecks and fire and corpses, but we could have held if—   Osney Kettleblack pushed past him.  There’s fighting on both sides of the river now, Y’Grace. It may be that some of Stannis’s lords are fighting each other, no one’s sure, it’s all confused over there. The Hound’s gone, no one knows where, and Ser Balon’s fallen back inside the city. The riverside’s theirs. They’re ramming at the King’s Gate again, and Ser Lancel’s right, your men are deserting the walls and killing their own officers. There’s mobs at the Iron Gate and the Gate of the Gods fighting to get out, and Flea Bottom’s one great drunken riot.   Gods be good, Sansa thought, it is happening, Joffrey’s lost his head and so have I. She looked for Ser Ilyn, but the King’s Justice was not to be seen. I can feel him, though. He’s close, I’ll not escape him, he’ll have my head.  Strangely calm, the queen turned to his brother Osfryd.  Raise the drawbridge and bar the doors. No one enters or leaves Maegor’s without my leave.    What about them women who went to pray?    They chose to leave my protection. Let them pray; perhaps the gods will defend them. Where’s my son?    The castle gatehouse. He wanted to command the crossbowmen. There’s a mob howling outside, half of them gold cloaks who came with him when we left the Mud Gate.    Bring him inside Maegor’s now.    No!  Lancel was so angry he forgot to keep his voice down. Heads turned toward them as he shouted,  We’ll have the Mud Gate all over again. Let him stay where he is, he’s the king—    He’s my son.  Cersei Lannister rose to her feet.  You claim to be a Lannister as well, cousin, prove it. Osfryd, why are you standing there? Now means today.   Osfryd Kettleblack hurried from the hall, his brother with him. Many of the guests were rushing out as well. Some of the women were weeping, some praying. Others simply remained at the tables and called for more wine.  Cersei,  Ser Lancel pleaded,  if we lose the castle, Joffrey will be killed in any case, you know that. Let him stay, I’ll keep him by me, I swear—    Get out of my way.  Cersei slammed her open palm into his wound. Ser Lancel cried out in pain and almost fainted as the queen swept from the room. She spared Sansa not so much as a glance. She’s forgotten me. Ser Ilyn will kill me and she won’t even think about it.   Oh, gods,  an old woman wailed.  We’re lost, the battle’s lost, she’s running.  Several children were crying. They can smell the fear. Sansa found herself alone on the dais. Should she stay here, or run after the queen and plead for her life?  She never knew why she got to her feet, but she did.  Don’t be afraid,  she told them loudly.  The queen has raised the drawbridge. This is the safest place in the city. There’s thick walls, the moat, the spikes…    What’s happened?  demanded a woman she knew slightly, the wife of a lesser lordling.  What did Osney tell her? Is the king hurt, has the city fallen?    Tell us,  someone else shouted. One woman asked about her father, another her son.  Sansa raised her hands for quiet.  Joffrey’s come back to the castle. He’s not hurt. They’re still fighting, that’s all I know, they’re fighting bravely. The queen will be back soon.  The last was a lie, but she had to soothe them. She noticed the fools standing under the galley.  Moon Boy, make us laugh.   Moon Boy did a cartwheel, and vaulted on top of a table. He grabbed up four wine cups and began to juggle them."
