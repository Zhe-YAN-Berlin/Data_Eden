  "text": " They went slowly in single file: Gollum, Sam, Frodo.       Frodo seemed the most weary of the three, and slow though they went. he  often lagged. The hobbits soon  found that what had looked like one vast fen   was  really  an  endless  network  of  pools,  and soft  mires. and  winding  half-strangled water-courses.  Among  these  a cunning eye  and  foot  could  thread  a wandering path. Gollum  certainly had that cunning, and needed all   of it. His head on its long  neck  was ever turning this way and that, while  he sniffed and muttered all the time to himself. Sometimes he would  hold up  his  hand and halt  them, while he went forward a little, crouching, testing  the ground with fingers or toes. or merely listening with one ear pressed to  the earth.       It was dreary and wearisome. Cold clammy winter still held sway in this  forsaken country. The only green was the scum  of  livid weed  on  the  dark   greasy surfaces of the sullen waters. Dead grasses  and rotting reeds loomed  up in the mists like ragged shadows of long-forgotten summers.        As the day wore on the light increased a little, and the mists  lifted,  growing thinner and more  transparent. Far above  the rot and vapours of the  world the Sun was riding high and golden now in a serene country with floors  of dazzling  foam, but  only a  passing  ghost of her could they  see below,  bleared,  pale, giving  no  colour  and  no  warmth. But even at this  faint   ####-reminder of  her  presence  Gollum  scowled and  flinched. He  halted  their  journey,  and they  rested,  squatting  like  little hunted animals, in  the  borders  of  a  great  brown  reed-thicket. There was  a   deep silence, only  scraped on its surfaces by the faint quiver of empty seed-plumes, and broken   grass-blades trembling in small air -movements that they could not feel.       'Not a bird! ' said Sam mournfully.       `No, no birds,' said  Gollum.  `Nice birds! ' He licked his  teeth. 'No  birds  here.  There  are snakeses,  wormses,  things in the  pools. Lots  of  things,  lots  of nasty things. No birds,' he ended sadly. Sam looked at him  with distaste.       So passed  the  third day  of  their  journey with  Gollum.  Before the  shadows of evening were long in happier lands, they went on again, always on  and  on with only brief halts. These  they made not  so much for rest as  to  help Gollum;  for now  even he had to go forward with great care, and he was  sometimes at a loss for a while. They had come to the very midst of the Dead  Marshes, and it was dark.       They  walked   slowly,  stooping,  keeping  close  in  line,  following  attentively  every move that  Gollum made.  The fens grew more  wet, opening  into  wide stagnant meres, among which it grew  more and more  difficult  to  find the firmer places where feet could tread without sinking  into gurgling  mud. The travellers were  light, or maybe none of them would ever have found  a way through.       Presently it  grew  altogether  dark: the air  itself seemed  black and  heavy to breathe. When lights appeared Sam  rubbed his eyes: he  thought his  head was going  queer. He first  saw one with the corner of his  left eye, a   wisp  of pale sheen that faded away;  but  others appeared soon  after: some  like dimly shining smoke,  some  like  misty flames flickering  slowly above  unseen candles; here and there they twisted like ghostly sheets  unfurled by  hidden hands. But neither of his companions spoke a word.       At  last  Sam could bear it  no longer. `What's all this, Gollum? '  he  said in a whisper. `These lights? They're all  round us now. Are we trapped?   Who are they? '       Gollum looked up. A  dark water was before him, and he was crawling  on  the ground, this way and that, doubtful of the way. 'Yes, they are all round  us,' he whispered. 'The tricksy lights. Candles  of corpses, yes, yes. Don't  you heed them! Don't look! Don't follow them! Where's the master? '       Sam looked back and found that Frodo had lagged again. He could not see   ####-him. He went some paces back into the darkness,  not daring to move far,  or   to call in more than a  hoarse  whisper. Suddenly he stumbled against Frodo,  who was standing lost in thought, looking at the pale lights. His hands hung  stiff at his sides; water and slime were dripping from them.       `Come,  Mr. Frodo!  ' said Sam.  'Don't look at  them!  Gollum says  we  mustn't. Let's keep up with him and get out of this cursed place as quick as  we can -- if we can!  '       `All right,' said Frodo,  as if returning out of a dream.  'I'm coming.  Go on!  '       Hurrying forward again, Sam tripped, catching his foot in some old root  or  tussock.  He fell  and came heavily on  his hands, which  sank deep into  sticky ooze,  so that his  fa ce was brought close to the surface of the dark  mere. There was a faint hiss, a noisome smell went up, the  lights flickered  and danced and swirled.  For a moment the water  below him  looked like some  window, glazed with grimy glass, through which he was  peering."
