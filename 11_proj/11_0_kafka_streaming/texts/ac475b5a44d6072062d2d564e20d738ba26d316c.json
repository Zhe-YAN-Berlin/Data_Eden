Lord Voldemorts gift for spreading discord and enmity is very great. We can fight it only by showing an equally strong bond of friendship and trust.  Differences of habit and language are nothing at all if our aims are identical and our hearts are open. \"It is my belief- and never have I so hoped that I am mistaken - that we are all facing dark and difficult times.  Some of you in this Hall have already suffered directly at the hands of Lord Voldemort.  Many of your families have been torn asunder.  A week ago, a student was taken from our midst. \"Remember Cedric.  Remember, if the time should come when you have to make a choice between what is right and what is easy, remember what happened to a boy who was good, and kind, and brave, because he strayed across the path of Lord Voldemort.  Remember Cedric Diggory.\" Harry's trunk was packed; Hedwig was back in her cage on top of it.  He, Ron, and Hermione were waiting in the crowded entrance hall with the rest of the fourth years for the carriages that would take them back to Hogsmeade station.  It was another beautiful summer's day.  He supposed that Privet Drive would be hot and leafy, its flower beds a riot of color, when he arrived there that evening.  The thought gave him no pleasure at all. \"'Arry!\" He looked around. Fleur Delacour was hurrying up the stone steps into the castle. Beyond her, far across the grounds. Harry could see Hagrid helping Madame Maxime to back two of the giant horses into their harness.  The Beauxbatons carriage was about to take off. \"We will see each uzzer again, I 'ope,\" said Fleur as she reached him, holding out her hand.  \"I am 'oping to get a job 'ere, to improve my Eenglish.\" \"It's very good already,\" said Ron in a strangled sort of voice.  Fleur smiled at him; Hermione scowled. \"Good-bye, 'Arry,\" said Fleur, turning to go.  \"It 'az been a pleasure meeting you!\" Harrys spirits couldn't help but lift slightly as he watched Fleur hurry back across the lawns to Madame Maxime, her silvery hair rippling in the sunlight. Wonder how the Durmstrang students are getting back,\" said Ron.  \"D' you reckon they can steer that ship without Karkaroff?\" \"Karkaroff did not steer,\" said a gruff voice. \"He stayed in his cabin and let us do the vork.\" Krum had come to say good-bye to Hermione.  \"Could I have a vord?\"  he asked her. \"Oh . . . yes ... all right,\" said Hermione, looking slightly flustered, and following Krum through the crowd and out of sight. \"You'd better hurry up!\"  Ron called loudly after her.  \"The carriages'll be here in a minute!\" He let Harry keep a watch for the carriages, however, and spent the next few minutes craning his neck over the crowd to try and see what Krum and Hermione might be up to.  They returned quite soon.  Ron stared at Hermione, but her face was quite impassive. \"I liked Diggory,\" said Krum abruptly to Harry.  \"He vos alvays polite to me.  Alvays. Even though I vos from Durmstrang - with Karkaroff,\" he added, scowling. \"Have you got a new headmaster yet?\"  said Harry Krum shrugged.  He held out his hand as Fleur had done, shook Harry's hand, and then Ron's. Ron looked as though he was suffering some sort of painful internal struggle.  Krum had already started walking away when Ron burst out, \"Can I have your autograph?\" Hermione turned away, smiling at the horseless carriages that were now trundling toward them up the drive, as Krum, looking surprised but gratified, signed a fragment of parchment for Ron.  The weather could not have been more different on the journey back to King's Cross than it had been on their way to Hogwarts the previous September.  There wasn't a single cloud in the sky.  Harry, Ron, and Hermione had managed to get a compartment to themselves. Pigwidgeon was once again hidden under Rons dress robes to stop him from hooting continually; Hedwig was dozing, her head under her wing, and Crookshanks was curled up in a spare seat like a large, furry ginger cushion.  Harry, Ron, and Hermione talked more fully and freely than they had all week as the train sped them southward.  Harry felt as though Dumbledore's speech at the Leaving Feast had unblocked him, somehow.  It was less painful to discuss what had happened now.  They broke off their conversation about what action Dumbledore might be taking, even now, to stop Voldemort only when the lunch trolley arrived. When Hermione returned from the trolley and put her money back into her schoolbag, she dislodged a copy of the Daily Prophet that she had been carrying in there.  Harry looked at it, unsure whether he really wanted to know what it might say, but Hermione, seeing him looking at it, said calmly, \"There's nothing in there.  You can look for yourself, but there's nothing at all. I've been checking every day.  Just a small piece the day after the third task saying you won the tournament.  They didn't even mention Cedric."
