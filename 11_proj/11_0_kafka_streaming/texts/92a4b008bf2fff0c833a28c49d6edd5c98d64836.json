For an instant the door   left  my control and began to open!  I had  to speak a word of Command. That  proved too great a strain.  The door burst in pieces.  Something  dark  as a   cloud was blocking out all the light inside, and I was thrown backwards down  the stairs. All the wall gave way, and  the roof of  the  chamber as well, I  think.       `I  am afraid Balin is buried deep, and maybe something  else is buried  there too. I  cannot say. But at least the passage behind  us was completely  blocked.  Ah! I have never  felt  so spent, but it  is passing. And now what  about  you, Frodo? There was not time to say  so, but I have never been more  delighted in my life than when you spoke.  I feared that it was  a brave but  dead hobbit that Aragorn was carrying.'       `What about me?  ' said  Frodo. 'I am  alive,  and whole I think. I  am  bruised and in pain, but it is not too bad.'       `Well,' said Aragorn, `I can only say that hobbits are made of  a stuff  so tough  that I  have  never met the like of it. Had  I known, I would have  spoken softer in the  Inn at  Bree! That spear-thrust would have  skewered a   wild boar! '       'Well, it did not skewer me, I am glad  to say,'  said Frodo; `though I  feel  as  if I had been caught between  a hammer  and an anvil.' He  said no  more. He found breathing painful.       'You take  after Bilbo,' said  Gandalf.  `There is  more about you than  meets the  eye, as I said  of  him long ago.'  Frodo wondered  if the remark  meant more than it said.       They  now went  on again. Before long Gimli spoke.  He had keen eyes in  the dark. `I think,' he said, `that there  is a light  ahead. But it  is not  daylight. It is red. What can it be? '       `Ghvsh!' muttered  Gandalf. `I wonder if that is what they meant:  that  the lower levels are on fire? Still, we can only go on.'       Soon the light became  unmistakable,  and could be  seen by all. It was  flickering and glowing  on the walls away down the passage before them. They  could now see their way: in front the road sloped down swiftly, and some way  ahead there stood  a low archway; through it the glowing light came. The air   ####-became very hot.       When they came to the  arch  Gandalf  went through,  signing to them to  wait.  As  he  stood just beyond the opening they saw his face  lit by a red  glow. Quickly he stepped back.       `There is some new devi lry here,' he said, 'devised for our welcome  no  doubt.  But I know now  where we are:  we  have reached the First Deep,  the  level immediately below the Gates. This is the Second Hall of Old Moria; and  the Gates are near: away beyond  the eastern end, on  the left, not more than  a quarter of a mile. Across the Bridge, up a broad stair,  along a wide road  through the First Hall, and out! But come and look! '       They peered out. Before them was another cavernous hall. It was loftier   and far  longer than the one in which they had  slept. They  were  near  its  eastern  end; westward it ran away into darkness. Down the  centre stalked a   double line of towering pillars. They were carved like boles of mighty trees  whose boughs upheld  the roof with a branching tracery of stone. Their stems  were smooth and black, but a  red glow was  darkly mirrored  in their sides.  Right  across the  floor, close  to the feet  of two  huge  pillars  a great  fissure  had opened. Out of it a fierce  red light came,  and  now and aga in  flames licked  at the brink and curled about the bases of the columns. Wisps  of dark smoke wavered in the hot air.       'If we had come by  the  main road down from the upper halls, we should   have been trapped here,' said Gandalf.  `Let  us hope that the fire now lies  between us and pursuit. Come! There is no time to lose.'       Even as he  spoke they heard again  the pursuing drum-beat: Doom, doom,  doom.  Away  beyond the  shadows  at the western end of the  hall there came  cries  and  horn-calls. Doom,  doom:  the pillars seemed  to tremble and the  flames to quiver.       `Now for the  last race! ' said Gandalf. 'If the sun is shining outside  we may still escape. After me!  '       He  turned left  and  sped  across the smooth  floor of the  hall.  The  distance was greater than it had looked. As they ran they heard the beat and  echo  of  many  hurrying feet behind.  A shrill  yell went up: they had been  seen. There was a  ring and clash of steel. An arrow  whistled over  Frodo's  head.       Boromir laughed. `They did not expect this,' he said. `The fire has cut  them off. We are on the wrong side! '       `Look ahead! ' called Gandalf. `The Bridge is near. It is dangerous and   ####-narrow.'       Suddenly Frodo saw before him a black chasm. At the end of the hall the  floor vanished and fell to an unknown  depth. The outer door  could only  be  reached by a slender bridge of stone, without kerb or rail, that spanned the  chasm with one curving  spring  of fifty feet."
