At one point,  near  the bank  of the Entwash, he came upon  footprints:  hobbit-prints, but  too  light for  much to  be made of  them. Then again beneath the bole of a great   ####-tree on the very edge of the wood more prints were discovered. The earth was  bare and dry, and did not reveal much.       'One hobbit at least stood  here for a while and looked  back; and then  he turned away into the forest,' said Aragorn.       'Then we must go  in, too,' said Gimli. 'But I do not like the look  of  this Fangorn: and  we  were  warned  against  it. I  wish the chase had  led  anywhere else!'       'I do  not think  the wood feels evil,  whatever  tales  may say,' said  Legolas. He stood under the  eaves of the forest, stooping forward, as if he  were listening, and peering with wide eyes into the shadows. 'No, it is  not  evil; or what evil is in it is far away. I catch only the faintest echoes of  dark places where the hearts of the trees are black. There is no malice near  us; but there is watchfulness, and anger.'       'Well, it has no cause to be angry with me,'  said Gimli.  'I have done  it no harm. '       'That is just as well,' said Legolas. 'But nonetheless it has  suffered  harm. There  is something  happening inside, or  going to happen. Do you not  feel the tenseness? It takes my breath.'       'I feel  the air is stuffy,' said the Dwarf. 'This wood is lighter than  Mirkwood, but it is musty and shabby.'       'It is old, very old,' said the Elf. 'So old that almost  I  feel young  again, as I have not felt since I journeyed with you children. It is old and  full of memory. I  could have been happy  here,  if  I  had come in days  of  peace.'       'I dare say  you could,'  snorted Gimli. 'You are a  Wood-elf,  anyway,  though Elves of any kind are strange folk. Yet you comfort me. Where you go,  I will go. But keep your bow ready to  hand, and I will keep my axe loose in  my belt. Not  for  use on trees,' he  added hastily, looking  up at the tree  under which they  stood.  'I do not  wish to meet that  old  man at unawares  without an argument ready to hand, that is all. Let us go!'       With that the three hunters plunged into the forest of Fangorn. Legolas  and Gimli left the tracking to Aragorn. There was little for him to see. The  floor of the forest was dry and covered with a drift of leaves; but guessing  that the fugitives would stay near the water, he returned oft en to the banks  of the stream.  So it was that he came upon the place where Merry and Pippin  had  drunk  and  bathed  their  feet.  There plain for all  to see were  the  footprints of two hobbits, one somewhat smaller than the other.   ####-     'This is good tidings,' said Aragorn. 'Yet  the marks are  two days old  And it seems that at this point the hobbits left the water -side.'       'Then what shall we do now?' said Gimli. 'We cannot pursue them through  the whole fastness of Fangorn. We have come ill supplied. If we do  not find   them soon, we shall be of no use to them, except to sit down beside them and  show our friendship by starving together.'       'If that is indeed all we can do, then we must do that,'  said Aragorn.  'Let us go on.'       They  came at  length  to the steep abrupt  end of Treebeard's Hill and  looked  up at the rock -wall with its rough  steps leading to the high shelf.   Gleams of sun were  striking through the hurrying clouds, and the forest now  looked less grey and drear.       'Let  us go up a nd look about us!' said Legolas. 'I will feel my breath  short. I should like to taste a freer air for a while.'       The  companions climbed  up. Aragorn came last,  moving slowly: he  was  scanning the steps and ledges closely.       'I am almost sure that the  hobbits  have been up here,'  he said. 'But  there  are  other marks,  very strange marks,  which  I do not understand. I  wonder if  we can see anything from this ledge which  will help us to  guess  which way they went next?'       He  stood up and looked about,  but he saw nothing that was of any use.  The shelf  faced southward  and  eastward; but only on the east was the view  open. There he could see the heads  of the trees descending in ranks towards  the plain from which they had come.       'We have journeyed a long way round,' said Legolas.  'We could have all  come here safe together, if  we had left  the  Great River  on the second or   third day and  struck  west.  Few  can foresee whither their road  will lead  them, till they come to its end.'       'But we did not wish to come to Fangorn,' said Gimli.       'Yet here we are-and nicely caught in the net,' said Legolas. 'Look!'       'Look at what?' said Gimli.       'There in the trees.'       'Where? I have not elf-eyes.'       'Hush! Speak more softly! Look!'  said Legolas  pointing. 'Down in  the  wood, back in the Way  that we have just come. It is he. Cannot you see him,  passing from tree to tree?'       'I  see, I see  now!' hissed Gimli."
