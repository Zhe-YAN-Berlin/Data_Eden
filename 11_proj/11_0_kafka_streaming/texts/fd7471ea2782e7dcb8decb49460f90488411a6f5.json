  "text": "  They were  four  days  gone,  and  by  that  time  they  knew  that  the  joined  armies  of  the  Lake-men  and  the  Elves  were  hurrying  towards  the  Mountain.  But  now  their hopes were higher; for they had food for some weeks with care-chiefly cram,  of course, and they were very tired of it; but cram is much better than nothing-and  already the gate was blocked with a wall of squared stones laid dry, but very thick  and  high  across  the  opening.  There  were  holes  in  the  wall  through  which  they  could  see  (or  shoot)  but  no  entrance.  They  climbed  in  or  out  with  ladders,  and  hauled stuff up with ropes. For the issuing of the stream they had contrived a small  low arch under the new wall; but near the entrance they had so altered the narrow  bed  that  a wide pool  stretched  from  the mountain-wall to the head of the fall over  which  the  stream  went  towards  Dale.  Approach  to  the  Gate  was  now  only  possible, without  swimming,  along  a narrow  ledge of  the  cliff,  to  the  right  as one  looked  outwards  from  the wall.  The  ponies  they  had  brought  only  to  the  head  of  the  steps  above  the  old  bridge,  and  unloading  them  there  had  bidden  them  return  to their masters and sent them back riderless to the South.  There  came  a  night  when  suddenly  there  were  many  lights  as  of  fires  and  torches away south in Dale before them.  \"They  have  come!\"  called  Balin.  \"And  their  camp  is  very  great.  They  must  have come into the valley under the cover of dusk along both banks of the river.\"  That night the dwarves slept little. The morning was still pale when they saw a  company approaching. From behind  their wall  they watched  them come up  to  the  valley's head and climb slowly up. Before long they could see that both men of the  lake  armed  as  if  for  war  and  elvish  bowmen  were  among  them.  At  length  the  foremost  of  these  climbed  the  tumbled  rocks  and  appeared  at  the  top  of  the  falls;  and very great was their surprise to see the pool before them and the Gate blocked  with a wall of new-hewn stone.  As they stood pointing and speaking to one another Thorin hailed them: \"Who  are  you,\"  he  called  in  a  very  loud  voice,  \"that  come  as  if  in  war  to  the  gates  of  Thorin son of Thrain, King under the Mountain, and what do you desire?\"  But  they  answered  nothing.  Some  turned  swiftly  back,  and  the  others  after  gazing  for  a while  at  the Gate  and  its  defences  soon  followed  them. That  day  the  camp was moved  and was  brought  right  between  the  arms  of  the Mountain.  The  rocks echoed then with voices and with song, as they had not done for many a day.   ####-There was  the  sound,  too,  of  elven-harps and of sweet music; and as  it echoed up  towards  them  it  seemed  that  the  chill  of  the  air  was  warmed,  and  they  caught  faintly the fragrance of woodland flowers blossoming in spring.  Then Bilbo longed to escape from the dark fortress and to go down and join in  the mirth  and  feasting  by  the  fires.  Some  of  the  younger  dwarves were moved  in  their  hearts,  too,  and  they  muttered  that  they  wished  things  had  fallen  out  otherwise and that they might welcome such folk as friends; but Thorin scowled.  Then  the  dwarves  themselves  brought  forth  harps  and  instruments  regained  from  the  hoard,  and  made  music  to  soften  his  mood;  but  their  song  was  not  as  elvish song, and was much like the song they had sung long before in Bilbo's little  hobbit-hole.     Under the Mountain dark and tall  The King has come unto his hall!  His foe is dead, the Worm of Dread,  And ever so his foes shall fall.    The sword is sharp, the spear is long,  The arrow swift, the Gate is strong;  The heart is bold that looks on gold;  The dwarves no more shall suffer wrong.    The dwarves of yore made mighty spells,  While hammers fell like ringing bells  In places deep, where dark things sleep,  In hollow halls beneath the fells.    On silver necklaces they strung  The light of stars, on crowns they hung  The dragon-fire, from twisted wire   The melody of harps they wrung.    The mountain throne once more is freed!  O! wandering folk, the summons heed!  Come haste! Come haste! across the waste!  The king of friend and kin has need.    Now call we over mountains cold,  'Come hack unto the caverns old'!  Here at the Gates the king awaits,   ####-His hands are rich with gems and gold.    The king is come unto his hall  Under the Mountain dark and tall.  The Worm of Dread is slain and dead,  And ever so our foes shall fall!     This song appeared to please Thorin, and he smiled again and grew merry; and  he began reckoning the distance to the Iron Hills and how long it would be before  Dain  could  reach  the  Lonely Mountain,  if  he  had  set  out  as  soon  as  the message  reached  him.  But  Bilbo's  heart  fell,  both  at  the  song  and  the  talk:  they  sounded  much  too  warlike."
