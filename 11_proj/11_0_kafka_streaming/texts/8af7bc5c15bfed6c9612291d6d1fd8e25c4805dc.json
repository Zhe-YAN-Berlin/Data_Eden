  "text": " That cheered them greatly; for  it  was  good to see a sight of anything beyond the  wood's border s,  though they did   not mean to go  that way,  if  they  could help it: the Barrow-downs  had as  sinister a reputation in hobbit -legend as the Forest itself.        At length they made up their minds  to go on again. The path  that  had  brought them to the hill reappeared on  the northward side; but they had not   followed it far before they became aware that it was bending steadily to the  right.  Soon it  began  to descend  rapidly and they  guessed  that  it must  actually be heading towards the Withywindle va lley: not at all the direction  they  wished  lo  take. After some  discussion  they decided to  leave  this  misleading path and strike northward; for although they had not been able to  see it  from the hill-top, the Road  must lie that way, and it  could not be  many miles off. Also northward, and to the left of the path, the land seemed   lo  be drier  and more  open,  climbing up to slopes  where  the  trees were  thinner,  and pines and firs replaced the oaks and ashes  and other  strange  and nameless trees  of the denser wood.       At first  their  choice  seemed  to  be good: they got along  at a fair  speed, though whenever they got  a glimpse of the sun  in an open glade they  seemed  unaccountably to have veered eastwards. But  after a time the  trees  began to close in again,  just where they had appeared from a distance to be  thinner and  less tangled. Then  deep  folds  in  the ground were discovered   ####-unexpectedly, like the ruts of great  giant-wheels or  wide moats and sunken  roads long disused and choked with  brambles. These lay usually right across  their  line  of march, and could only be crossed  by scrambling down and out  again, which was troublesome and difficult with their ponies. Each time they  climbed down they found the  hollow  filled  with  thick bushes  and  matted  undergrowth, which somehow would not  yield to the  left, but only  gave way  when they turned to the right; and they  had to go some  distance along  the  bottom before they could find a  way up  the  further bank.  Each  time they  clambered out, the trees seemed deeper and  darker;  and always  to the left  and upwards it was most difficult to find a way, and they were forced to the   right and downwards.        After an hour or two they had lost all clear sense of direction, though  they knew well enough that they had long ceased to go northward at all. They  were being headed off,  and were simply following a course chosen for them -  eastwards and southwards, into the heart of the Forest and not out of it.       The afternoon was wearing away when they scrambled and stumbled  into a   fold that was  wider and  deeper than any they had yet met. It  was so sleep  and  overhung that  it proved  impossible  to climb out  of it again, either   forwards  or  backwards, without  leaving  their ponies  and  their  baggage  behind. All  they could do  was to  follow  the fold - downwards. The ground  grew soft, and in places boggy; springs appeared in the banks, and soon they   found themselves following a brook that trickled and babbled through a weedy  bed. Then the ground began to fall rapidly, and the brook growing strong and  noisy, flowed and leaped swiftly downhill. They were in a deep dim-lit gully  over -arched by trees high above them.       After stumbling along for some way along  the  stream, they came  quite  suddenly out of the gloom. As if through a gate they saw the sunlight before  them.  Coming  to the opening they found  that they had  made their way down  through a cleft in a high sleep bank, almost a cliff. At its feet was a wide  space of grass and reeds; and in the distance could be glimpsed another bank   almost as  steep. A golden  afternoon  of  late sunshine lay warm and drowsy  upon  the hidden land between. In the midst of it there wound lazily a  dark  river  of brown  water,  bordered with ancient  willows,  arched  over  with  willows, blocked  with fallen willows,  and flecked with thousands  of faded  willow-leaves.  The  air was thick  with  them, fluttering  yellow from  the  branches;  for there  was a  warm  and gentle breeze blowing  softly   in the   valley, and the reeds were rustling, and the willow-boughs were creaking.   ####-     'Well, now I have at  least some  notion  of where we are!' said Merry.  'We have come almost in the opposite direction to which we intended. This is  the River Withywindle! I will go on and explore.'       He passed out into the sunshine and disappeared into the  long grasses.   After a while he reappeared, and reported that there was fairly solid ground  between the cliff-foot and the river; in  some places firm turf went down to  the water's edge. 'What's more,' he  said, 'there seems to be something like  a footpath  winding  along on  this side  of the river. If  we turn left and  follow it, we  shall be bound to  come out on the  east side of  the  Forest  eventually."
