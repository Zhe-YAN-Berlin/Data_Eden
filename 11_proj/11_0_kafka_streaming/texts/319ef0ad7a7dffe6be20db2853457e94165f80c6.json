There were hard  words, for it is long since war  has driven  us from  the green fields;  but  there have been no evil deeds.  All  is now ordered, as  you  see. And  your  lodging is prepared for you; for I have had full tidings of you and knew the  hour of your coming.'       'So Aragorn has come then,' said Jomer. 'Is he still here?'       'No, he is gone,' said Jowyn turning away and  looking at the mountains  dark against the East and South.       'Whither did he go?' asked Jomer.       'I  do not  know,'  she answered.  'He  came at  night,  and rode  away  yestermorn, ere the Sun had climbed over the mountain-tops. He is gone.'       'You are grieved, daughter,' said Thjoden. 'What has happened? Tell me,  did  he speak  of  that road?' He pointed  away along the darkening lines of  stones towards the Dwimorberg. 'Of the Paths of the Dead?'       'Yes, lord,' said Jowyn. 'And he has passed into the shadows from which  none have returned. I could not dissuade him. He is gone.'       'Then our paths are sundered,' said  Jomer. 'He is  lost.  We must ride  without him, and our hope dwindles.'       Slowly they  passed through the short heath and  upland grass, speaking  no  more, until they  came to the king's pavilion.  There  Merry  found that  everything  was made ready, and that he himself was not forgotten. A  little  tent had been pitched for  him beside the king's  lodging; and there he  sat  alone,  while men passed to and fro, going in to the king and taking counsel  with him. Night came on, and the half-seen heads of  the mountains  westward  were  crowned  with  stars, but the East was dark  and  blank.  The marching  stones  faded slowly  from sight,  but still beyond them,  blacker than  the  gloom, brooded the vast crouching shadow of the Dwimorberg.       'The  Paths  of the Dead,'  he muttered to himself. 'The  Paths  of the  Dead? What does all this mean? They have all left me now. They have all gone  to some doom:  Gandalf and Pippin to  war in the East; and  Sam and Frodo to  Mordor; and  Strider and  Legolas and Gimli to the Paths of the Dead. But my  turn will come  soon enough, I suppose. I  wonder what they are all  talking   ####-about, and what the king means to do. For I must go where he goes now.'       In the midst of these  gloomy  thoughts  he suddenly remembered that he  was very hungry, and he got  up to go and see if anyone else in this strange  camp felt the  same.  But at  that very moment a trumpet sounded, and  a man  came summoning him, the king's esquire, to wait at the king's board.       In the inner part of the pavilion was a small space, curtained off with  broidered  hangings, and strewn  with skins:  and there at a small table sat  Thjoden with Jomer and Jowyn, and DÂ®nhere,  lord of  Harrowdale. Merry  stood  beside the king's stool and waited on him till presently the old man, coming  out of deep thought, turned to him and smiled.       'Come, Master Meriadoc!'  he said. 'You shall  not stand. You shall sit  beside me, as long  as I remain  in my own lands, and lighten my heart  with  tales.'       Room was made for the hobbit at the king's left hand, but no one called  for any tale. There was indeed little speech, and they ate and drank for the  most  part in silence, until at last, plucking up courage,  Merry  asked the  question that was tormenting him.       'Twice  now, lord, I have heard  of the  Paths of the  Dead,'  he  said.  'What are  they? And where has Strider, I mean the Lord Aragorn where has he  gone?'       The king sighed, but no one answered, until at last Jomer spoke. 'We do  not know, and our hearts are heavy,' he  said. 'But as  for the Paths of the  Dead, you have yourself walked on their  first steps. Nay. I speak no  words  of  ill  omen! The road that  we have  climbed is  the approach to the Door,  yonder in the Dimholt. But what lies beyond no man knows.'       'No man knows,' said  Thjoden:  'yet ancient legend, now seldom spoken,   has  somewhat to  report. If these old  tales speak true that have come down  from father to son in the House  of  Eorl, then  the  Door  under Dwimorberg  leads to a  secret way that goes beneath the mountain to some forgotten end.   But none  have ever  ventured in to search its secrets, since Baldor, son of  Brego, passed the  Door  and was  never seen among men again. A rash  vow  he  spoke,  as he drained  the  horn  at that feast which  Brego made  to hallow  new-built Meduseld,  and he came never to the  high seat of which he was the  heir.       'Folk say that Dead Men  out of the Dark Years guard  the way  and will   ####-suffer no living man to come to their  hidden halls;  but at whiles they may  themselves  be seen passing out of the door  like shadows and down  the stony  road. Then the people of Harrowdale  shut fast  their doors and shroud their  windows and are afraid. But the Dead come seldom forth and only  at times of  great unquiet and coming death."
