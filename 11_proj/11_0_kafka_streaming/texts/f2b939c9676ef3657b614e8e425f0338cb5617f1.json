You  are summoned to  the Lord  of the City to learn your  new  duties.'       'And will he provide breakfast?'       'No! I have provided  it: all that you will get till noon. Food  is now  doled out by order.'       Pippin  looked  ruefully  at  the  small  loaf  and  (he  thought) very  inadequate  pat of   butter which was set out for him,  beside  a cup of thin  milk.  'Why did you bring me here?' he said.       'You know quite well,' said Gandalf. 'To keep you out  of mischief; and  if you do  not  like being here, you can remember  that  you  brought it  on  yourself.' Pippin said no more.       Before  long  he was  walking  with  Gandalf  once  more down  the cold   corridor to the  door of the Tower Hall. There Denethor sat in a grey gloom,   like an old patient spider, Pippin  thought: he  did not seem  to have moved  since the day before. He beckoned Gandalf to a seat, but Pippin was left for   a while standing unheeded. Presently the old man turned to him:       'Well, Master Peregrin,  I hope that you used yesterday to your profit,  and to your liking? Though  I fear that the board is barer in this city than  you could wish.'       Pippin had  an uncomfortable feeling that most  of what he had said  or   done was somehow known to the Lord of the City, and much was guessed of  what  he thought as well. He did not answer.       'What would you do in my service?'       'I thought, sir, that you would tell me my duties.'       'I will, when I learn what you are fit for,' said Denethor. 'But that I  shall learn soonest,  maybe,  if  I  keep you beside  me. The esquire of  my  chamber  has begged leave to  go to the out-garrison, so  you shall take his   ####-place for a while. You shall wait  on me, bear errands,  and talk to me,  if  war and council leave me any leisure. Can you sing?'       'Yes,' said Pippin.  'Well, yes, well enough for my  own people. But we  have no songs  fit for  great halls and evil times, lord. We seldom  sing of  anything more terrible  than wind  or rain. And most  of  my songs are about  things that make us laugh; or about food and drink, of course.'       'And why should such songs be unfit for my halls, or for such  hours as  these? We who have lived long under the  Shadow may surely listen to  echoes  from  a land  untroubled  by  it? Then we may  feel that our  vigil was  not  fruitless, though it may have been thank less.'       Pippin's heart sank. He did not  relish the idea of singing any song of  the Shire to the Lord of Minas Tirith, certainly not the comic  ones that he  knew best; they were too, well, rustic for such an  occasion. He was however  spared the ordeal  for  the present. He  was not commanded  to sing. Denethor  turned to Gandalf, asking questions about  the Rohirrim and  their policies,   and the position of Jomer, the king's nephew. Pippin marvelled at the amount  that the Lord seemed to  know about a people that  lived far away, though it   must, he thought, be many years since Denethor himself had ridden abroad.       Presently Denethor waved to Pippin and dismissed him again for a while.  'Go to the armouries of the Citadel,' he said, 'and get you there the livery  and gear of the  Tower. It will be ready. It was commanded yesterday. Return  when you are clad!'       It was  as he said; and Pippin soon  found himself  arrayed in  strange  garments, all of black and silver. He  had a small hauberk, its rings forged  of steel,  maybe,  yet black  as  jet; and a high-crowned  helm  with  small  raven-wings on  either  side, set with  a  silver star in the centre of  the  circlet.  Above the mail was a short surcoat  of black, but broidered on the  breast in silver with the token of the Tree. His old clothes were folded and  put away, but he was permitted to  keep the grey cloak of Lurien, though not   to wear it  when  on duty.  He looked now, had he  known it, verily Ernil  i  Pheriannath , the Prince of  the Halflings, that folk had  called him; but he  felt uncomfortable. And the gloom began to weigh on his spirits.        It  was  dark and dim all day. From the sunless dawn until evening  the  heavy shadow  had deepened,  and all hearts in the City were oppressed.  Far  above  a great cloud streamed slowly westward from the Black Land,  devouring  light, borne upon a wind of war; but below the air was still and breathless,    ####-as if all the Vale of Anduin waited for the onset of a ruinous storm.       About  the eleventh hour, released  at  last for  a while from service.  Pippin came  out and  went  in search  of food and  drink to cheer his heavy  heart  and make his task of waiting more  supportable. In  the messes he met  Beregond again, who  had just  come from an errand over the Pelennor  out to  the Guard-towers upon the Causeway. Together they strolled out to the walls;   for  Pippin felt imprisoned indoors, and stifled even in the  lofty citadel."
