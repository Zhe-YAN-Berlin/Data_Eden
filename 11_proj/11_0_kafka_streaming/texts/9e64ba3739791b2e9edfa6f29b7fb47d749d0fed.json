Frodo  stood near the open  door and watched the white chalky path turn into a little  river of milk and   ####-go bubbling away down into the  valley. Tom Bombadil came trotting round  the  corner of the house, waving his arms as if he was warding off the rain  - and  indeed when he sprang over the threshold he seemed quite dry, except for his  boots. These he took off and put in the chimney-corner. Then  he  sat in the  largest chair and called the hobbits to gather round him.       'This is Goldberry's  washing  day,' he said, 'and her autumn-cleaning.  Too wet for hobbit-folk - let them rest while they are able! It's a good day  for  long  tales, for  questions and for  answers,  so Tom  will  start  the  talking.'       He  then  told  them many remarkable  stories,  sometimes  half  as  if  speaking to  himself, sometimes looking at  them suddenly with a bright blue  eye  under  his deep brows. Often his voice would turn to song, and he would  get  out of  his chair  and  dance about.  He  told them tales of  bees  and  flowers,  the ways of trees, and the strange creatures  of the Forest, about  the  evil things  and good  things,  things  friendly and things unfriendly,  cruel things and kind things, and secrets hidden under brambles.       As they  listened,  they began to  understand  the lives of the Forest,  apart from themselves, indeed to  feel themselves as the strangers where all  other things were at home. Moving constantly in and out  of his talk was Old  Man  Willow, and Frodo learned now enough to content him, indeed  more   than  enough, for it was not comfortable lore. Tom's words laid bare the hearts of  trees and their thoughts, which were often dark and strange, and filled with  a  hatred of things that go free upon the  earth, gnawing, biting, breaking,  hacking, burning: destroyers and usurpers. It was not called  the Old Forest   without reason,  for  it  was indeed ancient,  a survivor  of vast forgotten  woods;  and  in it there  lived  yet, ageing no quicker than the hills,  the  fathers of the fathers of trees, remembering times when they were lords. The   countless  years  had  filled  them with pride  and rooted wisdom,  and with  malice.  But none were more dangerous  than the Great Willow:  his heart was  rotten, but his strength was  green; and  he was cunning,  and  a master  of  winds, and his song and thought ran through the woods  on both sides  of the   river.  His grey  thirsty spirit drew power out of the earth and spread like  fine root-threads in the ground, and invisible twig-fingers in the air, till  it had under its dominion nearly all the trees of the Forest  from the Hedge  to the Downs.    ####-     Suddenly  Tom's talk  left  the woods and  went leaping  up  the  young  stream, over  bubbling  waterfalls,  over  pebbles and worn rocks, and among  small flowers in close  grass and wet crannies, wandering at  last up  on to  the Downs. They heard of the Great Barrows, and the  green  mounds,  and the  stone-rings  upon the  hills and in the hollows among the hills.  Sheep were  bleating in flocks. Green  walls and white walls rose. There were fortresses  on the heights. Kings of little kingdoms fought together, and the young  Sun  shone like fire  on the red metal of their  new and greedy swords. There was  victory and defeat; and towers fell, fortresses were burned, and flames went   up into the sky. Gold was piled on the  biers of dead kings and queens;  and  mounds covered them, and the stone  doors were shut; and the grass grew over   all. Sheep  walked  for a while biting the  grass,  but soon the hills  were  empty again.  A  shadow came out of dark places far away, and the bones were  stirred in  the  mounds.  Barrow-wights walked in  the hollow places  with a   clink of  rings on  cold fingers, and gold chains in the wind.'  Stone rings  grinned out of the ground like broken teeth in the moonlight.       The  hobbits   shuddered.   Even  in  the   Shire  the  rumour  of  the  Barrow-wights of  the Barrow-downs beyond the Forest had  been heard. But it  was not a tale that  any  hobbit  liked to listen  to, even by a comfortable  fireside far away. These  four now  suddenly remembered what the joy of this  house had  driven from their minds: the  house of Tom Bombadil nestled under  the very shoulder of those dreaded hills. They   lost the thread of  his tale  and shifted uneasily, looking aside at one another.       When they caught his  words again  they found that he had  now wandered  into  strange regions beyond their  memory and  beyond their waking thought,  into  limes when the world was wider, and  the  seas flowed straight to  the  western  Shore;  and  still on  and back Tom went  singing out  into ancient  starlight, when only the Elf-sires were awake. Then suddenly he slopped, and  they saw that he nodded  as if he was falling asleep.  The hobbits sat still  before  him, enchanted; and it  seemed as if, under the  spell of his words,  the wind  had gone, and the clouds had  dried  up,  and  the  day  had  been  withdrawn, and darkness  had  come from  East and West, and all  the sky was  filled with the light of white stars."
