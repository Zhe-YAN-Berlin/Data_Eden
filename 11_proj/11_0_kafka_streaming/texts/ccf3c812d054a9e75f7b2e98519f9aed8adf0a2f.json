The door  was  scarred;  the bell-chain  was dangling  loose, and the bell would not  ring.  Knocking  brought no answer. At length they pushed and the door yielded. They went in.  The  place stank  and was  full of filth and  disorder: it did not appear to  have been used for some time.       'Where  is that miserable Lotho hiding?' said Merry. They  had searched  every room  and found no living thing save rats and  mice. 'Shall we turn on  the others to search the sheds?'       'This is  worse than Mordor!' said Sam. 'Much worse in  a way. It comes  home to you, as  they say; because it is home, and you remember it before it   was all ruined.'       'Yes,  this is Mordor,' said Frodo. 'Just one of its works. Saruman was  doing  its  work all  the time,  even  when he  thought  he was working  for   himself. And the same with those that Saruman tricked, like Lotho.'       Merry looked round in dismay and disgust. 'Let's get out!' he said. 'If  I had known all the  mischief he had caused, I should  have stuffed my pouch   ####-down Saruman's throat.'       'No doubt, no doubt! But you did not, and so I  am  able to welcome you   home.' There standing at the  door was Saruman himself, looking well -fed and  well-pleased; his eyes gleamed with malice and amusement.       A sudden light broke on Frodo. 'Sharkey!' he cried.       Saruman laughed.  'So you have heard the name, have you? All  my people  used to call me that in Isengard, I believe. A sign of affection, possibly.(  But evidently you did not expect to see me here.'       'I did not,' said Frodo. 'But I might  have guessed.  A little mischief  in a mean way: Gandalf warned me that you were still capable of it.       'Quite  capable,'  said Saruman, 'and more  than a little. You  made me  laugh, you hobbit-lordlings, riding  along with  all  those  great people so  secure and so pleased with your little selves. You thought you had done very  well out of it a ll, and could now just amble back and have a nice quiet time  in the country. Saruman's home could  be all wrecked, and he could be turned  out, but no one could touch  yours. Oh  no!  Gandalf would look  after  your   affairs.'       Saruman laughed  again. 'Not he! When his tools have done their task he  drops them. But you must  go dangling  after him,  dawdling and talking, and  riding round twice as far as you needed. \"Well,\" thought I, \"if they're such   fools, I  will  get ahead of them and  teach  them  a  lesson.  One ill turn  deserves another.\" It  would  have been  a  sharper lesson, if  only you had  given  me a  little  more time and more Men. Still  I have already done much   that you will  find  it hard to mend or undo in your lives. And  it  will be  plea sant to think of that and set it against my injuries.'       'Well, if that is what you find  pleasure in,' said Frodo, 'I pity you.  It will be a pleasure of memory only, I fear. Go at once and never return!'       The hobbits of the villages  had  seen Saruman  come out of one  of the  huts, and at once they came crowding up  to  the door of  Bag End. When they  heard Frodo's command, they murmured angrily:       'Don't let him go! Kill him! He's a villain and a murderer. Kill him!'       Saruman looked round at their hostile faces and smiled. 'Kill  him!' he  mocked. 'Kill him, if you think there  are enough of you, my brave hobbits!'  He drew himself  up and stared at them darkly  with his black eyes.  'But do  not think that when I lost all my goods I lost all my power! Whoever strikes  me shall  be accursed. And if my blood stains the Shire, it shall wither and  never again be healed.'   ####-     The hobbits recoiled. But Frodo said: 'Do  not believe him! He has lost   all power, save his voice that  can still daunt you and deceive you, if  you   let it.  But  I will not  have him slain. It is useless to meet revenge with  revenge: it will heal nothing. Go, Saruman, by the speediest way!'       'Worm! Worm!' Saruman called; and out of a  nearby hut came  Wormtongue,  crawling, almost like a dog. To the road again, Worm!' said Saruman.  'These  fine fellows and lordlings are turning us adrift again. Come along!'       Saruman turned  to go, and Wormtongue shuffled after  him.  But even as  Saruman passed close to Frodo a knife flashed in his  hand,  and  he stabbed  swiftly.  The blade turned  on  the hidden  mail-coat  and snapped.  A dozen   hobbits, led by Sam, leaped forward with a cry and flung  the villain to the  ground. Sam drew his sword.       'No, Sam!' said  Frodo. 'Do not kill him even now.  For he has not hurt  me.  And in any case I do not wish him to be slain in this evil mood. He was  great once, of  a  noble kind that we  should  not  dare to raise  our hands  against. He is fallen, and his cure is beyond us;  but  I would still  spare  him, in the hope that he may find it."
