Follow whom you will,  even the Grey Fool, though  his hope has failed. Here I stay.'       So it was that Gandalf took command of the last defence of the City  of  Gondor.  Wherever he came  men's  hearts would  lift  again,  and the winged  shadows pass from memory. Tirelessly he strode  from Citadel to  Gate,  from  north to south about the wall; and with him went the Prince of Dol Amroth in  his shining mail. For he and his knights still held themselves like lords in  whom the race  of NÂ®menor  ran   true. Men that  saw them  whispered  saying:  'Belike the old tales speak well; there is Elvish blood in the veins of that  folk, for the people of Nimrodel dwelt in that land once long ago.' And then  one would sing amid the gloom  some staves of the Lay of Nimrodel, or  other   songs of the Vale of Anduin out of vanished years.        And  yet  - when they had  gone, the shadows closed  on  men  again, and   their hearts  went cold, and the valour of Gondor  withered into ash. And so  slowly  they passed out of  a  dim  day  of  fears  into  the darkness of  a   desperate night. Fires  now raged unchecked in the first circle of the City,  and the garrison upon the outer wall was already in many places cut off from  retreat.  But the  faithful who remained there at their  posts were few; most   had fled beyond the second gate.       Far behind the  battle the  River had been swiftly bridged, and all day  more  force  and  gear of  war had poured across. Now at last  in the middle  night  the  assault was loosed. The vanguard  passed through the trenches of  fire by many devious paths that had been  left between  them. On  they came,  reckless of their loss as they  approached, still bunched and herded, within  the  range of  bowmen on the  wall. But indeed  there were too few  now  left   there to do them great damage, though the  light of the fires showed up many  a mark for archers of such skill as Gondor once had boasted. Then perceiving  that the valour of the City was already beaten down, the  hidden Captain put  forth his strength. Slowly the great siege-towers  built in Osgiliath rolled  forward through the dark.       Messengers came again to the chamber in the White Tower, and Pippin let  them enter,  for  they were  urgent. Denethor  turned  his head slowly  from  Faramir's face, and  looked at them silently.   ####-     'The first circle of  the City is burning, lord,'  they said. 'What are  your  commands?  You are  still  the  Lord and Steward.  Not all will follow  Mithrandir. Men are flying from the walls and leaving them unmanned.'       'Why? Why do the fools fly?' said Denethor. 'Better to burn sooner than  late, for burn we must. Go back to your bonfire! And I? I will go now to  my   pyre. To my  pyre! No tomb for Denethor  and Faramir. No tomb! No  long  slow  sleep of death embalmed. We wil l burn like heathen kings before  ever a ship  sailed hither from the West. The West has failed. Go back and burn!'       The messengers without bow or answer turned and fled.       Now Denethor  stood up and released the fevered hand of Faramir that he  had held. 'He is burning, already burning,' he said sadly. 'The house of his  spirit crumbles.' Then stepping softly towards Pippin he looked down at him.       'Farewell!' he said. 'Farewell, Peregrin  son of Paladin!  Your service  has  been short,  and now  it is drawing to an end.  I release you from  the  little that remains. Go now, and die in what way seems best to you. And with  whom you will, even that friend whose  folly brought you to this death. Send  for my servants and then go. Farewell!'       'I will  not say  farewell, my  lord,' said  Pippin kneeling.  And then  suddenly  hobbit-like  once more, he stood up  and looked the old man in the   eyes. 'I will  take your leave, sir,' he said;  'for  I want to  see Gandalf  very much indeed. But he is no fool; and I will  not think of dying until he  despairs of life.  But  from my word  and your service I do  not  wish to be  released while you live. And if they come at last to the Citadel,  I hope to  be here and stand beside you and earn  perhaps the arms that you have  given  me.'       'Do as  you  will,  Master  Halfling,' said Denethor.  'But  my life is  broken. Send for my servants!' He turned back to Faramir.       Pippin left him and called for the servants, and they came: six  men of  the household, strong and fair; yet they trembled  at the summons. But in  a   quiet voice  Denethor bade them lay warm coverlets on Faramir's bed and take  it up. And they  did  so, and  lifting  up the  bed  they  bore it from  the  chamber. Slowly they paced to trouble the fevered man as little as might be,   and Denethor, now bending on a staff, followed them; and last came Pippin.        Out from the White Tower they walked, as if to a funeral,  out into the  darkness,  where the overhanging cloud was lit beneath with flickers of dull   red."
