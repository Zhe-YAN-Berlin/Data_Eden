  "text": " You want food?    If you can spare it, we won’t say no,  Tom conceded.   Now when did you ever say no to anything, Tom?  the woman hooted.  I’ll roast some mutton for your friends, and an old dry rat for you. It’s more than you deserve, but if you gargle me a song or three, might be I’ll weaken. I always pity the afflicted. Come on, come on. Cass, Lanna, put some kettles on. Jyzene, help me get the clothes off them, we’ll need to boil those too.   She made good on all her threats. Arya tried to tell them that she’d been bathed twice at Acorn Hall, not a fortnight past, but the red-haired woman was having none of it. Two serving wenches carried her up the stairs bodily, arguing about whether she was a girl or a boy. The one called Helly won, so the other had to fetch the hot water and scrub Arya’s back with a stiff bristly brush that almost took her skin off. Then they stole all the clothes that Lady Smallwood had given her and dressed her up like one of Sansa’s dolls in linen and lace. But at least when they were done she got to go down and eat.  As she sat in the common room in her stupid girl clothes, Arya remembered what Syrio Forel had told her, the trick of looking and seeing what was there. When she looked, she saw more serving wenches than any inn could want, and most of them young and comely. And come evenfall, lots of men started coming and going at the Peach. They did not linger long in the common room, not even when Tom took out his woodharp and began to sing  Six Maids in a Pool.  The wooden steps were old and steep, and creaked something fierce whenever one of the men took a girl upstairs.  I bet this is a brothel,  she whispered to Gendry.   You don’t even know what a brothel is.    I do so,  she insisted.  It’s like an inn, with girls.   He was turning red again.  What are you doing here, then?  he demanded.  A brothel’s no fit place for no bloody highborn lady, everybody knows that.   One of the girls sat down on the bench beside him.  Who’s a highborn lady? The little skinny one?  She looked at Arya and laughed.  I’m a king’s daughter myself.   Arya knew she was being mocked.  You are not.    Well, I might be.  When the girl shrugged, her gown slipped off one shoulder.  They say King Robert fucked my mother when he hid here, back before the battle. Not that he didn’t have all the other girls too, but Leslyn says he liked my ma the best.   The girl did have hair like the old king’s, Arya thought; a great thick mop of it, as black as coal. That doesn’t mean anything, though. Gendry has the same kind of hair too. Lots of people have black hair.   I’m named Bella,  the girl told Gendry.  For the battle. I bet I could ring your bell, too. You want to?    No,  he said gruffly.   I bet you do.  She ran a hand along his arm.  I don’t cost nothing to friends of Thoros and the lightning lord.    No, I said.  Gendry rose abruptly and stalked away from the table out into the night.  Bella turned to Arya.  Don’t he like girls?   Arya shrugged.  He’s just stupid. He likes to polish helmets and beat on swords with hammers.    Oh.  Bella tugged her gown back over her shoulder and went to talk with Jack-Be-Lucky. Before long she was sitting in his lap, giggling and drinking wine from his cup. Greenbeard had two girls, one on each knee. Anguy had vanished with his freckle-faced wench, and Lem was gone as well. Tom Sevenstrings sat by the fire, singing,  The Maids that Bloom in Spring.  Arya sipped at the cup of watered wine the red-haired woman had allowed her, listening. Across the square the dead men were rotting in their crow cages, but inside the Peach everyone was jolly. Except it seemed to her that some of them were laughing too hard, somehow.  It would have been a good time to sneak away and steal a horse, but Arya couldn’t see how that would help her. She could only ride as far as the city gates. That captain would never let me pass, and if he did, Harwin would come after me, or that Huntsman with his dogs. She wished she had her map, so she could see how far Stoney Sept was from Riverrun.  By the time her cup was empty, Arya was yawning. Gendry hadn’t come back. Tom Sevenstrings was singing  Two Hearts that Beat as One,  and kissing a different girl at the end of every verse. In the corner by the window Lem and Harwin sat talking to red-haired Tansy in low voices.  …spent the night in Jaime’s cell,  she heard the woman say.  Her and this other wench, the one who slew Renly. All three o’ them together, and come the morn Lady Catelyn cut him loose for love.  She gave a throaty chuckle.  It’s not true, Arya thought. She never would. She felt sad and angry and lonely, all at once.  An old man sat down beside her.  Well, aren’t you a pretty little peach?  His breath smelled near as foul as the dead men in the cages, and his little pig eyes were crawling up and down her.  Does my sweet peach have a name?   For half a heartbeat she forgot who she was supposed to be. She wasn’t any peach, but she couldn’t be Arya Stark either, not here with some smelly drunk she did not know."
