  "text": "  For the Elves, I fear, it will prove at best a truce, in which they may pass  to  the  Sea  unhindered  and  leave the Middle-earth  for  ever.  Alas  for   Lothlurien that I  love! It would be a  poor life in a land where no mallorn   ####-grew.  But  if  there  are  mallorn-trees beyond  the Great Sea,  none  have  reported it.'       As they spoke  thus, the  Company filed slowly along the  paths  in the  wood, led by Hald ir, while the other Elf walked behind. They felt the ground  beneath their  feet smooth and  soft, and  after  a while they  walked  more  freely, without fear of hurt or  fall. Being deprived of sight, Frodo  found  his hearing and  other senses  sharpened. He could smell the  trees and  the  trodden  grass.  He could hear many  different notes in  the  rustle  of the  leaves overhead, the river murmuring away on  his right, and  the thin clear  voices of birds in  the sky. He  felt the sun upon his face  and hands  when  they passed through an open glade.       As  soon  as he  set  foot  upon the  far  bank of Silverlode a strange  feeling had come upon  him, and it  deepened as he walked on into the Naith:  it seemed to him that  he had stepped over a bridge of time into a corner of  the  Elder Days, and  was  -now walking  in  a world that  was  no  more.  In  Rivendell  there was memory of  ancient things; in Lurien the ancient things  still lived on  in the waking world. Evil had been  seen  and  heard  there,  sorrow had been known; the Elves  feared and  distrusted the world  outside:  wolves  were howling on  the wood's borders: but  on  the land  of Lurien no  shadow lay.       All that day the  Company marched on, until  they felt the cool evening  come and heard  the early night-wind whispering among many leaves. Then  they  rested and slept without fear upon the ground;  for  their guides would  not  permit  them to unbind their eyes, and they could  not climb. In the morning  they went  on again,  walking without  hast e. At noon they halted, and Frodo   was aware that they had  passed out under the shining Sun. Suddenly he heard  the sound of many voices all around him.       A marching host of Elves  had  come up silently:  they  were  hastening  toward the northern borders to guard against any attack from Moria; and they  brought news,  some of  which Haldir reported. The marauding orcs  had  been  waylaid and  almost all destroyed; the remnant had fled westward towards the  mountains, and were being pursued.  A strange creature also  had  been seen,  running with bent back and  with hands near the ground, like a beast and yet   not of beast-shape. It  had eluded  capture, and  they had not  shot it, not  knowing whether it was good or ill, and  it had vanished down the Silverlode  southward.   ####-     `Also,' said Haldir, `they bring me a message from the Lord and Lady of  the Galadhrim. You are all to walk free, even the dwarf Gimli. It seems that  the  Lady knows who and what is each member of  your  Company.  New  messages  have come from Rivendell perhaps.'       He  removed the  bandage  first from Gimli's eyes.  'Your pardon! '  he  said, bowing low. `Look on  us now with friendly eyes! Look and be glad, for   you are the  first  dwarf to behold the  trees of the Naith of  Lurien since  Durin's Day! '       When  his eyes were in  turn uncovered, Frodo looked up  and caught his  breath.  They were  standing  in an  open  space. To the  left stood a great  mound, covered with  a sward of grass as  green as Spring-time in the  Elder   Days.  Upon it , as a double crown, grew two circles of trees: the  outer had  bark  of  snowy white,  and  were leafless  but  beautiful in  their shapely  nakedness;  the inner were mallorn-trees of great height,  still arrayed  in  pale  gold. High  amid  the branches of a  towering  tree that stood in  the  centre of all there gleamed a white flet. At the feet of  the trees, and all  about  the  green hillsides the grass was studded with small golden  flowers  shaped  like  stars.  Among them,  nodding  on  slender  stalks,  were  other   flowers, white and palest green: they glimmered  as a mist amid the rich hue  of  the  grass. Over all the sky was blue, and  the sun  of afternoon glowed  upon the hill and cast long green shadows beneath the trees.        'Behold! You  are come to Cerin Amroth,' said Haldir. `For this is  the  heart  of the ancient realm  as it  was long ago, and here is the  mound  of  Amroth, where in  happier days his high house was built. Here ever bloom the  winter  flowers  in the  unfading grass:  the  yellow  elanor, and the  pale  niphredil. Here we will stay awhile, and  come  to the city of the Galadhrim  at dusk.'       The  others  cast themselves down  upon the  fragrant grass,  but Frodo  stood  awhile still lost in wonder.  It seemed  to him that  he  had stepped  through a high window  that looked on a vanished world. A light was  upon it  for which his language  had no  name.  All that  he saw was shapely, but the  shapes  seemed at once clear cut, as  if they had  been first conceived  and  drawn at the uncovering of  his eyes, and ancient as if they had endured for   ever."
