  "text": " It was  a  language in which there seemed to be many words  that he  knew, though spoken more richly and strongly than in the Shire, yet   he could not piece the words together. At times some Rider would lift up his  clear voice in stirring song,  and Merry felt his heart leap, though he  did  not know what it was about.       All the  same  he had been lonely, and  never more so  than now at  the  day's end.  He wondered where  in all this strange world  Pippin had got to;  and what would become of Aragorn and Legolas and Gimli. Then suddenly  like a  cold touch on his heart he thought of Frodo and Sam. 'I am forgetting them!'  he said  to himself reproachfully. 'And yet they are more important than all  the  rest of us. And I  came to help them; but now  they must be hundreds of  miles away, if they are still alive.' He shivered.       'Harrowdale at  last!' said Jomer. 'Our journey  is almost at  an end.'  They halted. The paths out of the narrow gorge fell steeply. Only a glimpse,   as  through a tall window, could be seen of the great valley in the gloaming  below. A single small light could be seen twinkling by the river.       'This journey is over, maybe,' said Thjoden, 'but I have far yet to go.  Last night the  moon was full, and in the morning I shall ride to Edoras  to  the gathering of the Mark.'       'But if you would take my  counsel,'  said  Jomer  in a low voice, 'you   would then return hither, until the war is over, lost or won.'       Thjoden smiled.  'Nay,  my son, for  so I will call you, speak  not the  soft words of Wormtongue in my old ears!' He drew himself up and looked  back  at the long line of his men fading into the dusk behind. 'Long years  in the  space of days it seems since I rode west;  but never  will I lean on a staff   ####-again. If the war is lost, what good will be my hiding in the hills? And  if  it is won, what grief will it be, even if I fall, spending my last strength?   But we will leave this now. Tonight I will lie in the Hold of Dunharrow. One  evening of peace at least is left us. Let us ride on! '       In  the  deepening  dusk  they came  down  into  the  valley. Here  the  Snowbourn flowed near  to the western walls of  the dale, and soon the  path  led them to a ford where the shallow  waters murmured  loudly on the stones.  The ford was guarded.   As the king approached many men sprang up out of  the  shadow of the rocks; and when they saw the king they cried with glad voices:   'Thjoden King! Thjoden King! The King of the Mark returns!'       Then one blew a long call on  a horn.  It  echoed in the  valley. Other   horns answered it, and lights shone out across the river.       And suddenly  there  rose a great chorus of  trumpets from high  above,  sounding from some hollow  place, as  it seemed, that gathered  their  notes  into one voice and sent it rolling and beating on the walls of stone.       So the  King  of  the Mark came back  victorious  out  of the  West  to  Dunharrow  beneath  the feet  of  the White  Mountains. There he  found  the  remaining  strength  of  his people  already assembled; for as soon  as  his  coming was known captains rode to  meet  him at  the ford,  bearing messages  from Gandalf. D®nhere,  chieftain of  the  folk of Harrowdale, was at  their  head.       'At dawn three  days ago,  lord,' he  said. 'Shadowfax came like a wind  out of  the West to  Edoras, and Gandalf brought  tidings of your victory to  gladden  our  hearts.  But  he  brought also  word from you  to  hasten  the  gathering of the Riders. And then came the winged Shadow.'       'The winged Shadow?' said Thjoden. 'We saw it also, but that was in the  dead of night before Gandalf left us.'       'Maybe, lord,' said D®nhere. 'Yet the same, or  another like to  it,  a   flying darkness in  the shape of a  monstrous bird, passed  over Edoras that  morning, and all men were  shaken with fear. For it  stooped  upon Meduseld,  and  as it came low, almost to the gable,  there came a cry that stopped our  hearts.  Then  it was that  Gandalf  counselled  us  not to  assemble in the  fields, but to meet you here in the valley under the mounta ins. And  he bade  us to kindle no more lights or fires than  barest need asked. So it has been  done. Gandalf spoke with great authority. We trust that it is as  you  would  wish. Naught has been seen in Harrowdale of these evil things.'       'It is well,' said Thjoden. 'I  will ride  now  to  the Hold, and there   ####-before  I go to rest I will meet the marshals and captains. Let them come to  me as soon as may be!'       The road now led eastward straight across the valley, which was at that  point little more than half a mile in width. Flats and meads of rough grass,   grey now in the falling night,  lay all about, but  in front on the far side  of the dale Merry saw a frowning wall, a last outlier of the great  roots of  the Starkhorn, cloven by the river in ages past .       On all the level spaces there was great concourse of men."
