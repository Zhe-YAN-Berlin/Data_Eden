I know some good ones now.  Just do me one favor, okay?  Buy Ron some different dress robes and say they're from you.\" He left the compartment before they could say another word, stepping over Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who were still lying on the floor, covered in hex marks.

Harry,\" said Ron, clapping him on the back. \"'Bye, Harry!\"  said Hermione, and she did something she had never done before, and kissed him on the cheek. \"Harry - thanks,\" George muttered, while Fred nodded fervently at his side. Harry winked at them, turned to Uncle Vernon, and followed him silently from the station.  There was no point worrying yet, he told himself, as he got into the back of the Dursleys' car. As Hagrid had said, what would come, would come ... and he would have to meet it when it did.  ."
