In the twilight he saw a   large  black  Orc,  probably  Ugl®k,  standing  facing  Grishnbkh,  a  short  crook -legged creature, very broad and with long arms that hung almost to the  ground. Round  them  were many smaller  goblins. Pippin supposed that  these  were the ones from the  North. They had drawn  their knives and swords,  but  hesitated to attack Ugl®k.       Ugl®k  shouted, and a  number of other Orcs of  nearly his own size ran  up. Then suddenly, without  warning, Ugl®k sprang  forwards,  and  with  two  swift strokes swept  the heads  off two of his opponents.  Grishnbkh stepped  aside and  vanished  into the  shadows. The others gave way, and one stepped  backwards  and fell  over Merry's  prostrate  form with  a  curse. Yet  that  probably saved his life, for Ugl®k's followers leaped over him and  cut down  another with their broad-bladed swords. It was the yellow-fanged  guard. His  body fell right on top of Pippin, still clutching its long saw-edged knife.       'Put up your weapons!' shouted Ugl®k. 'And let's have no more nonsense!  We go straight west  from here, and down the stair.  From  there straight to  the  downs, then along the  river to the forest. And we march day and night.  That clear?'       'Now,' thought  Pippin,  'if  only it takes  that ugly  fellow a little   ####-while to get his  troop under control, I've got  a chance.' A gleam of  hope  had come to him. The edge  of the black knife had snicked his arm, and  then  slid down to his wrist.  He  felt the blood trickling on to his hand, but he  also felt the cold touch of steel against his skin.       The Orcs were getting ready to march again, but some of the Northerners  were still unwilling, and the Isengarders slew two more before the rest were  cowed.  There  was  much  cursing  and confusion. For  the moment Pippin was  unwatched. His legs were  securely bound, but his arms were  only tied about  the wrists,  and his hands were  in front  of  him. He could  move them both  together, though the bonds were cruelly tight. He pushed the dead Orc to one  side, then hardly daring to  breathe, he drew the  knot of the wrist -cord up  and down against the blade of the knife. It was sharp and the dead hand held  it fast. The cord was cut! Quickly Pippin took it in his fingers and knotted   it again into a loose  bracelet of two loops and slipped it  over his hands.   Then he lay very still.       'Pick up those prisoners!' shouted Ugl®k.  'Don't play any  tricks with  them! If they are not alive when we get back, someone else will die too.'       An Orc  seized Pippin like a sack. put its head between his tied hands,   grabbed his arms and  dragged them  down, until  Pippin's  face was  crushed  against its neck; then it jolted off  with him. Another treated Merry in the  same way. The Orc's clawlike hand gripped Pippin's arms like iron; the nails  bit into him. He shut his eyes and slipped back into evil dreams.        Suddenly he was thrown on to the stony floor again. It was early night,  but the  slim moon was already falling westward. They were on the  edge of a  cliff that seemed to look out  over a sea of pale mist. There was a sound of  water falling nearby.       'The scouts have come back at last,' said an Orc close at hand.       'Well, what did you discover?' growled the voice of Ugl®k.       'Only a single horseman, and he made off westwards. All's clear now.'       'Now,  I  daresay. But how  long? You fools! You should  have shot him.   He'll  raise the alarm. The cursed horsebreeders will hear of us by morning.  Now we'll have to leg it double quick.'       A shadow bent over  Pippin. It  was Ugl®k. 'Sit up! ' said the  Orc. 'My  lads are tired of lugging you about. We have got to climb down and you  must   use your legs. Be  helpful now. No  crying out, no trying to escape. We have  ways of paying for tricks that you won't like, though they won't spoil  your  usefulness for the Master.'   ####-     He cut the thongs round Pippin's legs and ankles, picked him  up by his  hair  and stood him  on his feet. Pippin fell down, and Ugl®k dragged him up  by  his hair again. Several Orcs  laughed. Ugl®k thrust a  flask between his  teeth and poured some burning liquid down  his  throat: he felt a hot fierce  glow  flow through  him.  The pain in his legs and ankles vanished. He could  stand.       'Now for  the other!' said Ugl®k.  Pippin saw him go  to Merry, who was  lying  close  by,  and kick  him. Merry groaned.  Seizing him roughly  Ugl®k  pulled  him into a sitting position, and tore the bandage off his head. Then  he smeared the wound with some dark  stuff out of a small wooden  box. Merry  cried out and struggled wildly.       The Orcs clapped and  hooted. 'Can't take his medicine,'  they  jeered.  'Doesn't know what's good for him. Ai! We shall have some fun later.'       But  at the moment Ugl®k was not engaged in  sport."
