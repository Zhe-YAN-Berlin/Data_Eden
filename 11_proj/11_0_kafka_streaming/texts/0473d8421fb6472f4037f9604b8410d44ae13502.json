'Hobbit?' said Beregond.       'That is what we call ourselves,' said Pippin.       'I am glad to learn it,' said Beregond, 'for now I may say that strange  accents  do not   mar fair speech,  and hobbits are  a  fair-spoken folk. But  come! You shall make me acquainted with this good  horse. I love beasts, and  we  see  them  seldom  in this  stony city;  for my  people  came  from  the  mountain-vales, and before that from Ithilien. But fear not! The visit shall  be short, a mere call of courtesy, and we will go thence to the butteries.'       Pippin found that Shadowfax had been well housed and tended. For in the  sixth circle, outside the walls of the citadel, there were some fair stables  where  a   few  swift  horses  were  kept,  hard  by  the  lodgings  of  the  errand-riders of  the  Lord: messengers always ready  to  go at  the  urgent  command of Denethor or his  chief  captains. But  now all the horses and the   riders were out and away.   ####-     Shadowfax  whinnied as Pippin  entered the stable and  turned his head.  'Good morning!'  said Pippin.  'Gandalf will come  as soon as  he may. He is  busy, but he sends greetings, and I am to see that all is well with you; and  you resting, I hope, after your long labours.'       Shadowfax  tossed  his  head  and  stamped. But he allowed  Beregond to  handle his head gently and stroke his great flanks.       'He looks  as if he were spoiling for a race, and not newly come from a   great journey,' said Beregond. 'How  strong and proud  he is!  Where  is his  harness? It should be rich and fair.'       'None is  rich  and fair  enough for him,' said Pippin.  'He will  have  none. If he will consent to bear you, bear you he does; and if not, well, no  bit, bridle,  whip,  or  thong  will  tame  him.  Farewell, Shadowfax!  Have  patience. Battle is coming.'       Shadowfax lifted up his head and neighed, so that the stable shook, and  they covered their ears.  Then they took their leave, seeing that the manger   was well filled.       'And now for our  manger,' said Beregond, and he led Pippin back to the  citadel, and so  to a door in the north side of the great tower. There  they  went  down a  long  cool stair into a  wide alley lit with lamps. There were  hatches in the walls at the side, and one of these was open.       'This  is the storehouse and buttery of my company of the  Guard.' said  Beregond.  'Greetings,  Targon!' he called through the hatch.  'It  is early  yet, but here is a newcomer that the Lord has taken into his service. He has  ridden long and far with a tight belt, and has had sore labour this morning,  and he is hungry. Give us what you have!'       They got there bread, and butter, and cheese  and  apples:  the last of  the  winter store,  wrinkled but  sound and sweet;  and a leather flagon  of  new-drawn ale, and  wooden platters  and cups. They put  all into  a  wicker   basket and climbed back into the sun; and Beregond brought Pippin to a place  at  the  east  end of  the  great out-thrust battlement where  there was  an  embrasure in  the walls with a stone seat beneath the sill. From there  they  could look out on the morning over the world.       They  ate  and drank; and they  talked now of  Gondor and its  ways and  customs, now  of the Shire and the strange countries that  Pippin  had seen.  And ever as they talked Beregond  was more amazed,  and looked with  greater   wonder  at the  hobbit, swinging his short  legs as he sat  on the seat,  or   standing tiptoe upon it to peer over the sill at the lands below.   ####-     'I will not hide from you, Master Peregrin,' said Beregond, 'that to us  you look almost as one of our children, a lad of nine summers or so; and yet   you have endured  perils  and seen marvels that few of our  greybeards could  boast of. I thought  it was the whim of  our Lord to take him  a noble page,  after the manner of the kings of old, they say. But I see that it is not so,  and you must pardon my foolishness.'       'I do,' said Pippin. 'Though you are  not far  wrong. I am still little  more than a boy in the reckoning of my own people, and it will be four years  yet  before I \"come of age\", as we say in the Shire: But do not bother about  me. Come and look and tell me what I can see.'       The  sun was now  climbing, and the  mists in the  vale below  had been  drawn up. The last of them  were  floating away, just  overhead, as wisps of  white cloud borne  on  the  stiffening breeze from  the East,  that  was now  flapping and tugging the flags and white standards of the citadel. Away down  in the valley-bottom, five leagues or  so as  the eye leaps, the Great River   could now  be seen grey  and glittering, coming  out of the  north-west, and  bending in a mighty sweep south and west again, till it was lost to  view in  a haze and shimmer, far beyond which lay the Sea fifty leagues away."
