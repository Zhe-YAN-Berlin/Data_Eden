  "text": " Then all the sky was  clean and blue and birds sang in  every tree.       Frodo rose to his feet. A great weariness was on him,  but his will was  firm and his heart lighter. He spoke aloud to himself. `I  will do now what I  must,' he said.  'This at least is plain: the evil of the Ring is already at  work even in the Company,  and the Ring must leave them before it  does more  harm. I will go alone. Some I cannot  trust, and  those I  can trust are too  dear  to me: poor old  Sam,  and Merry and  Pippin. Strider,  too: his heart  yearns for Minas Tirith, and he will be needed there, now Boromir has fallen  into evil. I will go alone. At once.'       He went quickly  down the path and came back to the lawn where  Boromir  had found him. Then he halted, listening. He thought he could hear cries and   calls from the woods near the shore below.        'They'll be hunting  for  me,' he  said. `I wonder how long I have been  away. Hours, I should think.' He hesitated. 'What can  I  do? ' he muttered.  'I must go now or I shall never go.  I shan't  get  a  chance  again. I hate  leaving them, and like  this without  any explanation. But surely  they will  understand. Sam will. And what else can I do?'       Slowly he  drew out the Ring and put it  on  once more. He vanished and   passed down the hill, less than a rustle of the wind.   ####-     The others remained long by the river -side. For some time they had been  silent, moving restlessly about; but now they  were sitting in a circle, and  they  were talking. Every now  and again they made efforts to speak of other   things,  of  their  long road and many  adventures;  they questioned Aragorn  concerning the realm of Gondor and its ancient  history, and the remnants of  its great works that could still be seen in this strange border -land  of the  Emyn  Muil: the stone kings and  the  seats of Lhaw and Hen, and  the  great  Stair  beside  the falls  of  Rauros. But always  their  thoughts  and words  strayed back to Frodo and the Ring. What would Frodo choose  to do? Why   was  he hesitating?        `He is  debating  which course  is  the most desperate, I think,'  said  Aragorn. 'And well he may. It is now more hopeless than ever for the Company  to  go east, since we have  been tracked by Gollum,  and  must fear that the  secret of our journey is already betrayed.  But Minas Tirith is no nearer to  the Fire and the destruction of the Burden.       `We may remain there for a while  and make  a brave stand; but the Lord  Denethor and all his men cannot hope to do what even Elrond  said was beyond  his power: either to keep the Burden  secret. or to hold  off the full might  of the Enemy when he comes  to take it.  Which way would any of us choose in  Frodo's place? I do not know. Now indeed we miss Gandalf most.'       'Grievous is our loss,'  said Legolas.  'Yet we must needs make up  our  minds without his aid.  Why cannot we decide, and so help Frodo? Let us call  him back and then vote! I should vote for Minas Tirith.'       `And so should I,'  said Gimli. 'We, of course, were only sent  to help  the  Bearer along the  road, to go no further than we wished; and none of us  is under any oath or  command to  seek Mount Doom.  Hard was my parting  from  Lothlurien. Yet I have come so far, and I say this: now we  have reached the  last  choice, it  is clear to  me that I  cannot leave Frodo. I would choose  Minas Tirith, but if he does not, then I follow him.'       `And I  too will go with him,' said Legolas. `It would be faithless now  to say farewell.'       'It would indeed be a betrayal, if we all left him,' said Aragorn. 'But  if  he goes east,  then all need not go  with him; nor  do I think that  all  should. That venture is desperate: as much so for eight as for three or two,  or  one alone.  If  you  would let me choose,  then  I should  appoint three   ####-companions:  Sam, who  could not  bear it otherwise; and  Gimli; and myself.   Boromir  will return to his own city,  where his father and his  people need  him; and with him the others should go, or at  least Meriadoc  and Peregrin ,  if Legolas is not willing to leave us.'       `That won't do at all! ' cried Merry. 'We can't leave Frodo! Pippin and  I  always intended to go wherever he went,  and we still  do. But we did not  realize what that would mean. It  seemed different so far away, in the Shire  or in Rivendell. It  would  be mad and cruel to let Frodo go  to Mordor. Why   can't we stop him?'       'We must stop  him,'  said Pippin.  `And  that is what  he  is worrying  about, I am sure. He knows we shan't agree to his going east. And  he doesn't   like to ask anyone to go with him, poor old fellow. Imagine it: going off to  Mordor  alone! ' Pippin shuddered. 'But the dear silly  old hobbit, he ought  to know that he  hasn't got to ask.  He ought  to know that if we can't stop  him, we shan't leave him.'       'Begging  your  pardon,'  said  Sam. 'I don't  think you understand  my  master  at all."
