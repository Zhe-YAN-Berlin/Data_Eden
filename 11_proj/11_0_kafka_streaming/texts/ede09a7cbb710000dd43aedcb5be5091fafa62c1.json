Ere long we shall come to the mouth of the Limlight  that runs  down from Fangorn to join  the  Great  River. That  is  the north  boundary  of Rohan; and  of old all that lay between  Limlight and the White  Mountains belonged to the Rohirrim. It  is a rich and pleasant land, and its  grass has no rival; but in these evil days folk do not dwell by the River or   ride often  to its shores.  Anduin  is  wide, yet  the orcs  can shoot their  arrows  far across  the stream; and of late, it is said,  they have dared to  cross the water and raid the herds and studs of Rohan.'       Sam looked from bank to  bank  uneasily. The trees had  seemed  hostile  before, as if they harboured secret eyes and  lurking dangers; now he wished   that  the trees were still  there. He felt  that the  Company was too naked,  afloat in  little open  boats  in  the midst of shelterless  lands, and on a   river that was the frontier of war.       In  the  next day  or two, as they went on, borne  steadily southwards,  this feeling  of insecurity grew  on  all the Company. For  a whole day they  took to  their  paddles  and  hastened forward. The banks  slid by. Soon the  River broadened and grew more shallow; long stony beaches lay upon the east,  and  there were  gravel-shoals  in  the water, so that  careful steering was  needed. The Brown Lands rose into bleak wolds, over which flowed a chill air   ####-from  the  East. On  the  other  side the meads had  become rolling downs of  withered grass amidst a land of fen and tussock. Frodo shivered, thinking of  the lawns and fountains, the clear sun and gentle rains of Lothlurien. There  was little speech and  no laughter  in any of  the boats. Each member of the  Company was busy with his own thoughts.        The heart of  Legolas was running under  the stars of a summer night in  some  northern glade amid  the beech-woods; Gimli  was fingering gold in his  mind, and wondering if it were  fit to be  wrought into the  housing  of the  Lady's gift.  Merry and  Pippin in the middle  boat  were  ill at  ease, for   Boromir sat muttering  to himself, sometimes biting his nails,  as  if  some  restlessness or doubt consumed him, sometimes  seizing a paddle and  driving  the boat  close behind Aragorn's. Then Pippin, who sat  in  the bow  looking  back, caught a queer gleam in his eye, as he peered forward gazing at Frodo.   Sam had  long  ago  made up his mind  that,  though boats were maybe  not as  dangerous  as  he  had been  brought  up  to  believe,  they were  far  more  uncomfortable  than even  he had  imagined. He was   cramped  and  miserable,  having nothing to do but stare at the winter -lands crawling by and the  grey  water on either side of him. Even when the paddles were in use they  did not  trust Sam with one.       As dusk drew down on the fourth day, he was looking back over the bowed  heads of Frodo and Aragorn and the following boats; he was drowsy and  longed  for camp and the feel of earth under his toes. Suddenly something caught his  sight: at first he stared  at it listlessly, then  he sat  up and rubbed his  eyes; but when he looked again he could not see it any more.       That night they camped  on a small eyot close to  the western bank. Sam  lay rolled  in  blankets  beside Frodo. `I had a funny dream an hour or  two  before we  stopped, Mr.  Frodo,' he said. `Or maybe it wasn't a dream. Funny  it was anyway.'       `Well,  what was it? ' said  Frodo,  knowing that  Sam would not settle  down until he had told his tale, whatever it was. 'I haven't seen or thought  of anything to make me smile since we left Lothlurien.'       `It wasn't funny that way, Mr. Frodo.  It was  queer.  All wrong, if it  wasn't a dream. And you had best hear it. It was like this: I saw a log with  eyes!  '       `The log's  all right,' said Frodo.  `There are  many in the River. But  leave out the eyes!  '   ####-     `That I won't,'  said Sam. ` 'Twas  the eyes as made me sit  up,  so to  speak. I saw what I took to be a log floating along in the half-light behind  Gimli's boat; but I didn't  give much heed to it. Then  it seemed as if  the  log  was slowly  catching us  up. And  that  was peculiar, as you might say,  seeing as we were all  floating on  the stream together. Just then I saw the  eyes: two pale sort of points, shiny-like, on a hump at the  near end of the  log. What's  more, it  wasn't a  log, for it had  paddle-feet, like a swan's  almost, only they seemed bigger, and kept dipping in and out of the water.       'That's when  I sat right up  and rubbed  my  eyes,  meaning  to give a   shout,  if  it was still there  when I had rubbed the drowse out of my head.   For the whatever -it-was was coming along fast now and  getting close  behind  Gimli. But whether those two lamps spotted me moving and staring, or whether  I came to my senses, I don't know. When I looked again, it wasn't there."
