' said Gollum, covering his  ears with his hands, as if such  frankness, and the open speaking of the names, hurt him. `We guessed, yes we  guessed,' he  whispered;  `and we didn't  want  them  to  go,  did  we?  No,  precious, not the nice hobbits. Ashes, ashes, and dust, and thirst there is;   and pits, pits, pits, and Orcs, thousands of Orcses. Nice hobbits mustn't go  to -- sss  -- those places.'       `So you have been there?  ' Frodo insisted. `And you're being drawn back   there, aren't you?'       `Yess. Yess. No! ' shrieked Gollum. `Once, by  accident it  was, wasn't   it, precious? Yes, by accident. But we won't go back, no, no!' Then suddenly   his voice and language changed,  and he sobbed in his throat,  and spoke but  not to them. `Leave me alone, gollum! You hurt me.  O my poor hands, gollum!  I,  we, I don't want  to come back. I can't find it. I am tired. I, we can't   find it, gollum, gollum,  no, nowhere. They 're always awake.  Dwarves,  Men,  and Elves, terrible Elves  with  bright eyes. I can't find it. Ach! ' He got  up and clenched his long hand into a bony fleshless knot, shaking it towards  the East. 'We  won't! ' he  cried. 'Not for  you.' Then he collapsed   again.  'Gollum, gollum,' he whimpered with his face  to the  ground. 'Don't look at  us! Go away! Go to sleep!'       `He will not go  away or go to sleep at  your  command, Smjagol,'  said   ####-Frodo. `But if you  really wish to be free of  him again. then you  must help  me. And that I fear means finding us a path towards him. But you need not go  all the way, not beyond the gates of his land.'       Gollum sat up  again  and looked at him under  his eyelids. 'He's  over   there,' he cackled. `Always there. Orcs  wi ll take you all the  way. Easy to  find Orcs east of  the River. Don't ask Smjagol. Poor, poor Smjagol, he went   away long ago. They took his Precious, and he's lost now.'       `Perhaps we'll find him again, if you come with us,' said Frodo.       'No, no, never! He's lost his Precious,' said Gollum.       'Get up! ' said Frodo.       Gollum stood up and backed away against the cliff.       `Now! '  said Frodo. 'Can  you find  a path easier by day or by  night?   We're tired; but if you choose the night, we'll star t tonight.'       `The big lights hurt our eyes, they do,' Gollum whined. `Not  under the  White  Face, not  yet. It will go behind  the  hills soon, yess. Rest  a bit  first, nice hobbits!'       `Then sit down,' said Frodo, `and don't move!'       The  hobbits  seated themselves  beside  him, one on  either side. with  their backs to the stony wall, resting their legs. There was no need for any  arrangement by word: they knew that they must not sleep for a moment. Slowly  the moon went by. Shadows fell down from the hills, and all grew dark before  them. The stars grew thick  and bright in  the sky  above.  No one  stirred.  Gollum  sat  with his legs drawn up, knees  under chin, flat hands  and feet  splayed on the ground,  his eyes closed; but he seemed tense, as if thinking  or listening.       Frodo looked across at Sam. Their eyes met and  they  understood.  They  relaxed,  leaning  their heads back, and  shutting their eyes or seeming to.  Soon  the sound of  their  soft  breathing  could be  heard. Gollum's  hands  twitched  a little. Hardly perceptibly his head moved  to  the left  and the  right, and  first one eye and then the other opened a slit. The hobbits made  no sign.       Suddenly,  with startling agility and  speed, straight  off  the ground  with a jump like a  grasshopper or a frog. Gollum  bounded  forward into the   darkness. But that was just what Frodo and Sam had expected.  Sam was on  him  before he had gone two paces after  his spring. Frodo coming behind  grabbed  his leg and threw him.   ####-     'Your rope might prove useful again, Sam.' he said.       Sam  got  out the  rope. 'And  where were you  off  to in the cold hard  lands, Mr. Gollum?' he growled. 'We wonders.  aye,  we wonders. To find  some  of  your orc-friends,  I warrant. You nasty treacherous creature. It's round  your neck this rope ought to go, and a tight noose too.'       Gollum lay quiet and tried  no further tricks.  He did not  answer Sam,  but gave him a swift venomous look.       `All we need is something to keep a hold on him,' said Frodo. 'We  want  him  to walk, so it's  no good  tying his legs-or his arms. he seems to  use  them nearly as much. Tie one end to his  ankle, and keep a grip on the other   end.'       He  stood over Gollum, while Sam  tied the  knot. The  result surprised  them both. Gollum  began to scream, a thin, tearing sound, very  horrible to  hear. He writhed, and tried to get his mouth to his ankle and bite the rope.   He kept on screaming.       At last Frodo was  convinced that  he really was  in pain; but it could  not be from the knot."
