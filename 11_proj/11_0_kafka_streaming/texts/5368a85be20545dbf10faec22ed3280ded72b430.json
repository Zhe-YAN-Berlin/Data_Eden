Anyway they  could  not get a grip on it, or make a crack in  it; and they  were bruising  and wounding themselves against it. 'So Treebeard went out into the ring and  shouted.  His  enormous voice  rose above  all the din.  There  was  a  dead  silence, suddenly. In it we  heard a shrill  laugh from a high window in the  tower.  That had a queer effect on the Ents. They had been boiling over; now  they became cold, grim as  ice, and quiet.  They left the plain and gathered  round Treebeard,  standing quite still.  He  spoke  to  them for a little in  their own language; I think he was telling them of a plan he had made in his  old head long before. Then they just faded silently away in  the grey light.  Day was dawning by that time.       'They set a  watch on the tower,   I believe,  but  the watchers were so  well hidden in  shadows  and kept so  still, that  I could not see them. The  others went away north. All  that day they were busy, out of  sight. Most of   ####-the time  we were left  alone. It  was a dreary day; and we wandered about a   bit, though we kept out of the view of the windows of Orthanc, as much as we  could: they stared at us so threateningly. A good deal of the time  we spent  looking for something to eat. And also we sat and talked, wondering what was  happening away south in Rohan,  and what had  become of all the rest  of our  Company. Every  now  and  then we could hear in the distance the rattle  and  fall of stone, and thudding noises echoing in the hills.        'In the afternoon we walked round the circle,  and  went  to have a look   at what was going on. There was  a great shadowy  wood of Huorns at the head  of the  valley, and  another round the northern wall. We  did not dare to go  in. But there was a rending, tearing noise of work going on inside. Ents and  Huorns were  digging great  pits  and  trenches, and making  great pools and  dams, gathering all the waters of the Isen and every other spring and stream  that they could find. We left them to it.       'At dusk Treebeard came back to the gate. He was humming a nd booming to  himself, and seemed pleased. He stood and stretched  his great arms and legs  and breathed deep. I asked him if he was tired.       ' \"Tired?\" he said, \"tired? Well  no, not tired, but stiff.  I  need  a   good  draught  of  Entwash.  We  have   worked  hard;   we  have  done  more  stone-cracking and earth-gnawing today than we have done in many a long  year  before. But it is nearly finished. When night falls do not  linger near this  gate or in the  old tunnel! Water may come through-and it will be  foul water   for a while, until all the filth  of Saruman  is washed away. Then  Isen can  run clean  again.\" He began  to pull  down  a bit  more of  the walls,  in a   leisurely sort of way, just to amuse himself.       'We were just  wondering where  it  wou ld  be  safe to lie and get some  sleep, when the most amazing thing of all happened. There was the sound of a   rider coming swiftly  up the road. Merry  and I lay quiet, and Treebeard hid  himself in the shadows under the arch. Suddenly  a great horse came striding  up, like a flash of silver. It was already dark. but I could see the rider's  face clearly: it seemed to shine, and all his clothes were white. I just sat  up, staring, with my mouth open. I tried to call out, and couldn't.       'There  was no  need.  He  halted  just by  us and looked down  at  us.  'Gandalf!' I said  at last.  but my voice  was only  a whisper. Did he  say:  \"Hullo, Pippin! This is a pleasant surprise!\"? No, indeed! He said: \"Get up,  you tom-fool  of a Took! Where, in the name of wonder, in  all  this ruin is   ####-Treebeard? I want him. Quick!\"       'Treebeard heard his voice  and  came out of the shadows  at once;  and  there was a strange meeting. I was surprised, because neither of them seemed  surprised at all.  Gandalf obviously  expected to find  Treebeard  here; and  Treebeard  might almost have been loitering about near the  gates on purpose  to  meet  him. Yet we  had  told  the old  Ent all  about  Moria. But then I  remembered a queer look he gave us  at the time. I can only suppose that  he  had  seen Gandalf or  had some  news of him, but would not say anything in a  hurry. \"Don't  be hasty\" is  his motto; but nobody, not even Elves, will say  much about Gandalf's movements when he is not there.       '\"Hoom! Gandalf!\" said Treebeard.  \"I  am  glad  you have come. Wood and  water, stock and stone, I can master; but there is a Wizard to manage here.\"       '\"Treebeard,\" said Gandalf. \"I need your help. You have done much,  but  I need more. I have about ten thousand Orcs to manage.\"       'Then those two went off and had a council  together in some corner. It  must have seemed very  hasty  to  Treebeard, for Gandalf was in a tremendous  hurry, and was already talking  at a great  pace,  before they passed out of  hearing."
