We should  have no shelter there  from snow, or stones  -- or anything   else.'       `And it is no good going back while the storm holds,' said Aragorn. `We  have  pa ssed  no place on the way up that  offered  more  shelter  than this  cliff-wall we are under now.'       `Shelter!' muttered Sam. `If this is shelter, then one wall and no roof  make a house.'       The Company now gathered together  as close to the cliff as  they could.  It faced  southwards, and near the bottom it leaned  out  a little, so  that  they hoped it would give  them some protection  from  the northerly wind and  from the falling  stones. But eddying blasts swirled  round them from  every  side, and the snow flowed down in ever denser clouds.       They huddled together with their backs to the wall. Bill the pony stood  patiently but dejectedly in  front  of  the  hobbits,  and  screened  them a   little; but before long the  drifting snow was above his  hocks, and it went  on mounting. If they had had no  larger companions the  hobbits  would  soon  have been entirely buried.       A great sleepiness came over Frodo; he felt himself sinking fast into a   warm and hazy dream. He thought a fire was heating his toes,  and out of the  shadows on the other side of the hearth he heard Bilbo's voice  speaking.  I  don't think much of your diary , he  said. Snowstorms on January the twelfth:  there was no need to come back to report that!       But I wanted rest and sleep, Bilbo, Frodo answered with an effort, when  he  felt  himself shaken, and he came back painfully to wakefulness. Boromir  had lifted him off the ground out of a nest of snow.   ####-     `This will be the death  of the halflings, Gandalf,'  said Boromir. `It  is useless  to sit  here until the  snow goes  over  our heads.  We must  do  something to save ourselves.'       `Give them this,' said Gandalf, searching in his pack and drawing out a   leathern flask. `Just a mouthful each -- for all of us. It is very precious.  It is miruvor, the cordial of Imladris. Elrond gave it to me at our parting.  Pass it round!'       As soon as Frodo had swallowed a little of the warm and fragrant liquor   he felt a new strength of heart, and the  heavy drowsiness  left  his limbs.   The  others a lso  revived and found fresh hope and vigour. But the snow  did   not  relent. It whirled about  them thicker  than  ever, and the  wind  blew  louder.       'What do  you say to fire?' asked Boromir  suddenly. 'The  choice seems  near now between fire and death, Gandalf. Doubtless we shall be hidden  from  all unfriendly eyes when the  snow has covered us,  but that  will not  help  us.'       'You may make a fire,  if you can,' answered Gandalf. 'If there are any  watchers that can endure this storm, then they  can see us, fire or no.' But  though they had  brought wood and kindlings by  the  advice  of Boromir,  it   passed the skill of Elf or even Dwarf to strike a flame that would hold amid  the swirling wind or catch  in  the  wet fuel.  At  last reluctantly Gandalf  himself took a hand. Picking  up a faggot he held it aloft for a moment, and  then with a word of command, naur an edraith ammen! he thrust the end of his  staff into  the midst of it.  At once a great spout  of green and blue flame  sprang out, and the wood flared and sputtered.       `If there  are any  to  see, then I at  least am revealed to  them,' he  said. 'I have  written Gandalf  is  here  in signs  that all  can  read from  Rivendell to the mouths of Anduin.'       But the Company cared no longer for watchers or unfriendly  eyes. Their   hearts were rejoiced to see  the light of the fire. The wood burned merrily;  and though  all round it  the  snow  hissed, and pools of  slush crept under   their feet, they warmed  their hands gladly at the  blaze. There they stood,   stooping  in  a circle round the little  dancing and  blowing flames. A  red  light was on their tired and anxious faces; behind them the night was like a   black wall.       But the wood was burning fast, and the snow still fell.       The fire burned low. and the last faggot was thrown on.   ####-     The night is getting old,' said Aragorn. \"The dawn is not far off.'       `If any dawn can pierce these clouds,' said Gimli.       Boromir  stepped  out of the  circle and stared up into  the blackness.   'The snow is growing less,' he said, `and the wind is quieter.'       Frodo gazed wearily at the flakes  still  falling out of the dark to be  revealed white  for a moment in the light of the dying fire;  but for a long  time he could see no sign of their slackening. Then suddenly,  as sleep  was  beginning to creep over him again, he  was aware that  the  wind had  indeed   fallen,  and the flakes were  becoming larger and fewer. Very slowly  a  dim  light began to grow."
