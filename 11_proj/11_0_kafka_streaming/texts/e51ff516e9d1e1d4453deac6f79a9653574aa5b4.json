I  have nowhere to keep it  now, except in my hand, and  I shall need both hands in the blind night. But  Sting I give to you. I have  got an orc-blade, but I do not think it will be  my part to strike any blow again.'   ####-     It  was difficult and dangerous moving in  the  night  in the  pathless  land; but slowly and with much  stumbling the two hobbits  toiled on hour by  hour northward along the eastern edge of the stony valley. When a grey light  crept back over the western  heights, long after day had opened in the lands  beyond, they went into hiding again and slept a little, turn by turn. In his  times  of waking  Sam  was busy  with thoughts  of food. At  last when Frodo  roused himself and spoke of eating and making ready for yet  another effort,  he asked the question that was troubling him most.       'Begging your pardon, Mr. Frodo,' he said, 'but have you any notion how  far there is still to go?'       'No, not any clear notion, Sam, ' Frodo answered. 'In Rivendell before I  set out I was shown a map of Mordor that was made before the Enemy came  back  here; but I only remember it  vaguely. I remember clearest  that there was a   place in the north where the western  range and the  northern range send out  spurs that nearly meet. That must be twenty leagues at least from the bridge   back by the  Tower.  It might be  a  good point at which  to cross.  But  of  course, if we get there, we shall be further than we were from the Mountain,  sixty miles from it,  I should think. I guess that we have gone about twelve  leagues  north from the bridge now.  Even if  all goes  well, I could hardly  reach  the Mountain in  a week. I am afraid, Sam, that the  burden  will get  very heavy, and I shall go still slower as we get nearer.'       Sam  sighed. 'That's just as I feared,' he said. 'Well,  to say nothing  of water, we've got to eat less, Mr.  Frodo,  or else move a bit quicker, at  any rate while we're still in this valley. One more bite  and all the food's  ended, save the Elves' waybread.'       'I'll try  and be  a  bit  quicker, Sam,'  said  Frodo,  drawing a deep  breath. 'Come on then! Let's start another march!'       It was not yet quite dark again. They plodded along, on into the night.  The hours passed in  a weary stumbling trudge with a few brief halts. At the  first  hint of grey light  under the skirts of the canopy of shadow they hid  themselves again in a dark hollow under an overhanging stone.       Slowly  the  light  grew, until it  was clearer than it yet had been. A  strong wind from the West was now driving the fumes of Mordor from the  upper  airs. Before long the hobbits could make out the shape of the land for  some  miles  about  them.  The trough  between the  mountains  and  the Morgai had   ####-steadily dwindled as it climbed upwards, and the inner ridge was now no more  than a shelf in the steep faces of the Ephel DÂ®ath; but to  the east it fell  as  sheerly as  ever down into Gorgoroth. Ahead the water -course came  to an  end in broken steps of rock; for out from the main range there sprang a high  barren spur, thrusting  eastward like a wall. To meet it there stretched out  from the grey and misty  northern  range  of Ered Lithui a long jutting arm;  and between the ends there  was a narrow gap: Carach Angren, the Isenmouthe,  beyond  which lay the deep  dale of Udyn.  In that dale  behind the Morannon  were the tunnels and deep armouries that the servants of Mordor had made for   the defence of the Black Gate of their  land; and there now  their  Lord was  gathering in haste great forces to meet the onslaught of the Captains of the  West. Upon the out-thrust spurs forts and towers were built, and watch-fires  burned;  and all  across  the gap an earth-wall had been  raised, and a deep  trench delved that could be crossed only by a single bridge.       A few miles north, high up in the angle where the western spur branched  away from the main range, stood the old castle  of Durthang, now one of  the  many orc-holds  that  clustered about  the dale of  Udyn.  A  road,  already  visible in the growing light, came winding  down from it, until only a  mile  or two from where the hobbits  lay it turned east and ran along a  shelf cut  in the side of the  spur, and so went  down  into the plain,  and  on to the  Isenmouthe.       To  the hobbits as  they  looked  out it seemed that all their  journey  north had been useless. The plain to their right was dim and smoky, and they  could  see  there  neither camps nor troops moving; but all  that region was  under the vigilance of the for ts of Carach Angren.       'We have  come to a dead end, Sam,'  said Frodo. 'If we go on, we shall  only come up to that orc-tower, but the only  road to take is that road that  comes down from it - unless we go back. We can't climb up westward, or climb  down eastward.'       'Then we must take the road, Mr."
