A light  like the glint  of  water on dewy grass  flashed from under her  feet as she  danced.       They hastened up the  last slope, and stood breathless beside her. They  bowed, but with a wave of her arm she bade them look round; and they  looked  out from the hill-top  over lands under the morning. It was now as clear and   far-seen as it  had been veiled and misty  when they stood upon the knoll in  the  Forest,  which could now be seen rising pale and green out of  the dark  trees in the West. In that direction the land rose in  wooded ridges, green,   ####-yellow,  russet under  the sun, beyond which lay hidden the  valley  of  the  Brandywine. To the South, over  the  line of  the Withywindle,  there was  a   distant glint like pale glass where  the Brandywine River  made a great loop   in the  lowlands  and  flowed   away  out of  the  knowledge of the  hobbits.   Northward  beyond  the dwindling  downs  the land  ran  away  in  flats  and  swellings of grey  and green and pale earth -colours, until it  faded  into a   featureless and  shadowy  distance.  Eastward  the Barrow-downs  rose, ridge  behind ridge into the morning, and vanished out of eyesight into a guess: it  was no more  than a guess of  blue and a remote  white glimmer blending with  the hem of the sky,  but it spoke to them, out of  memory  and old tales, of  the high and distant mountains.       They  took a deep draught  of  the air, and felt that a skip and  a few  stout strides would  bear  them wherever they wished. It seemed fainthearted   to go jogging aside over the crumpled skirts of the downs  towards the Road,  when they  should be leaping,  as lusty as Tom, over the stepping  stones of  the hills straight towards the Mountains.        Goldberry spoke  to them  and recalled their eyes and thoughts.  'Speed  now, fair guests!'  she said. 'And hold to your purpose! North with the wind  in  the left eye and a blessing on your footsteps! Make haste while the  Sun  shines!'  And  to Frodo  she  said:  'Farewell,  Elf-friend, it was a  merry  meeting!'       But Frodo found no words to answer. He bowed low, and mounted his pony,  and followed by his friends jogged slowly down the gentle slope  behind  the  hill. Tom Bombadil's house and the valley, and the Forest were lost to view.   The  air  grew warmer between the green walls of hillside  and hillside, and  the scent of turf rose strong and sweet as they breathed. Turning back, when  they reached  the bottom  of the green hollow, they saw Goldberry, now small  and slender like  a sunlit flower  against the  sky: she  was standing still  watching them, and her hands were stretched out towards them. As they looked  she gave a  clear  call,  and lifting  up  her hand she turned  and vanished  behind the hill.       Their way wound along the floor of the hollow, and round the green feet  of a steep hill into  another deeper and  broader  valley, and then over the  shoulder of further hills, and down their long  limbs, and  up  their smooth  sides again, up on to  new hill -tops and down into new valleys. There was no  tree  nor any visible water: it  was a country  of  grass  and short springy  turf, silent  except for the whisper of the air over the edges  of the land,   ####-and high lonely cries of  strange birds.  As they journeyed the sun mounted,   and grew hot. Each time they climbed a ridge the breeze seemed to have grown  less. When they caught a  glimpse of the country westward the distant  Forest  seemed to be  smoking, as if the fallen rain was steaming up again from leaf  and root and mould.  A shadow now lay round the edge of  sight, a dark  haze  above which the upper sky was like a blue cap, hot and heavy.       About mid-day  they  came to  a hill whose top  was wide and flattened,  like a shallow  saucer with a  green mounded rim. Inside  there was  no  air  stirring,  and the sky seemed near their heads. They rode  across and looked   northwards. Then  their hearts rose,  for it seemed plain that they had come  further already than they had expected. Certainly the distances  had now all  become hazy and deceptive, but there could  be no doubt that  the Downs were  coming to  an end. A  long valley  la y below  them winding  away northwards,   until it  came  to  an opening  between two  steep shoulders. Beyond,  there  seemed  to be  no more hills. Due north  they faintly glimpsed  a  long dark  line. That is a line  of trees,' said Merry, 'and that must mark  the  Road.  All  along it for many leagues  east of the Bridge there are  trees growing.  Some say they were planted in the old days.'       'Splendid!'  said Frodo. 'If we make as good going this afternoon as we  have done this morning, we shall have left  the Downs before the Sun sets and  be jogging on in search of a camping place.'  But even as he spoke he turned  his glance eastwards, and he saw that on that side the hills were higher and  looked down  upon them; and all those hills were crowned with green  mounds,   and on some were standing  stones, pointing upwards like jagged teeth out of  green gums."
