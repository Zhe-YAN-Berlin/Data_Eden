As the morning wore on the wind  fell  and  the  air grew  heavy with expectancy. The hobbits could  see that  Bregalad  was now listening intently, although to them,  down in the dell of  his ent-house, the sound of the Moot was faint.       The afternoon came, and the sun, going west towards the mountains. sent  out  long  yellow beams  between the  cracks  and  fissures of  the  clouds.   Suddenly they were aware  that  everything wa s very quiet; the  whole forest   stood in listening silence. Of course, the Ent -voices had stopped.  What did  that mean? Bregalad was standing up erect and tense, looking back northwards  towards Derndingle.       Then with  a crash came  a great ringing shou t:  ra-hoom-rah! The trees  quivered and bent as if a gust had struck them. There was another pause, and  then a  marching  music began like solemn drums, and above the rolling beats  and booms there welled voices singing high and strong.       We come, we come with roll of drum: ta -runda runda runda rom!       The Ents were coming: ever nearer and louder rose their song:       We come, we come with horn and drum: ta -ryna ryna ryna rom!       Bregalad picked up the hobbits and strode from his house.       Before  long  they  saw the  marching  line approaching: the Ents  were  swinging along with great strides down the slope towards them. Treebeard was  at  their head,  and  some  fifty followers  were  behind him,  two abreast,   ####-keeping step with their feet  and beating time  with  their hands upon their  flanks. As they drew near the flash and flicker of their eyes could be seen.       'Hoom, hom! Here we  come with a  boom, here  we come at last!'  called   Treebeard when he caught sight of Bregalad  and the hobbits. 'Come, join the  Moot! We are off. We are off to Isengard!'       'To Isengard!' the Ents cried in many voices.        'To Isengard!'       To Isengard! Though Isengard be ringed and barred with doors of stone;       Though Isengard be strong and hard, as cold as stone and bare as bone,       We go, we go, we go to war, to hew the stone and break the door;       For bole and bough are burning now, the furnace roars -- we go to war!       To land of gloom with tramp  of doom, with  roll  of drum, we come,  we   come;       To Isengard with doom we come!       With doom we come, with doom we come!       So they sang as they marched southwards.       Bregalad, his eyes shining, swung into  the  line beside Treebeard. The  old Ent  now took the hobbits back, and set them on his shoulders again, and  so they rode proudly at the head of  the sin ng  company with beating hearts  and heads held high. Though they ad expected something to happen eventually,  they were amazed at the change that had come over the Ents. It seemed now as  sudden  as the bursting of a flood that had long been held back by a dike.       'The Ents made up  their minds rather quickly, after all, didn't they?'  Pippin  ventured to  say  after  some time, when  for a  moment  the singing  paused, and only the beating of hands and feet was heard.       'Quickly?' said Treebeard. 'Hoom! Yes, indeed. Quicker than I expected.  Indeed I have not seen them roused like this for many an age. We Ents do not  like being roused; and we never are roused unless it is clear to us that our  trees  and our  lives  are in  great  danger. That has not happened  in this  Forest since the wars of Sauron and the Men of the Sea.  It is the orc-work,  the wanton hewing  -- rbrum --  without even the  bad excuse of  feeding the  fires, that has so angered us; and the  treachery of a neighbour, who should  have helped us. Wizards ought to know better: they do know  better. There is  no curse in  Elvish, Entish, or  the  tongues  of Men bad  enough  for  such  treachery. Down with Saruman!'       'Will you really break the doors of Isengard?' asked Merry.       'Ho, hm, well, we could, you know! You do not know, perhaps. how strong   ####-we are. Maybe you have heard  of Trolls? They  are mighty strong. But Trolls  are only counterfeits. made by the  Enemy in the Great  Darkness, in mockery  of Ents, as Orcs were of Elves. We are stronger than Trolls.  We are made of  the  bones  of  the earth. We can split stone like  the roots of trees, only  quicker, far quicker, if our minds are roused!  If we  are not hewn down, or   destroyed  by  fire  or blast  of  sorcery,  we could  split  Isengard  into  splinters and crack its walls into rubble.'       'But Saruman will try to stop you. won't he?'       'Hm,  ah, yes, that is so. I  have  not  forgotten  it.  Indeed  I have  thought long about it. But. you see, many of the Ents are younger than I am.   by many lives of trees. They  are all  roused now. and  their mind is all on   one  thing: breaking Isengard.  But they will  start  thinking  again before  long; they  will  cool down a little."
