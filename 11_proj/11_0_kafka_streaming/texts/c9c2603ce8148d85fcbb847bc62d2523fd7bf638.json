  "text": " Next moment, Ludo Bagman charged into the box. \"Everyone ready?\"  he said, his round face gleaming like a great, excited Edam. \"Minister - ready to go?\" \"Ready when you are, Ludo,\" said Fudge comfortably. Ludo whipped out his wand, directed it at his own throat, and said \"Sonorus!\" and then spoke over the roar of sound that was now filling the packed stadium; his voice echoed over them, booming into every corner of the stands. \"Ladies and gentlemen. . . welcome!  Welcome to the final of the four hundred and twenty-second Quidditch World Cup!\" The spectators screamed and clapped.  Thousands of flags waved, adding their discordant national anthems to the racket.  The huge blackboard opposite them was wiped clear of its last message (Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans - A Risk With Every Mouthful!) and now showed BULGARIA:  0, IRELAND:  0. \"And now, without further ado, allow me to introduce. . . the Bulgarian National Team Mascots!\" The right-hand side of the stands, which was a solid block of scarlet, roared its approval. \"I wonder what they've brought,\" said Mr. Weasley, leaning forward in his seat. \"Aaah!\"  He suddenly whipped off his glasses and polished them hurriedly on his robes. \"Veela!\" \"What are veel -?\"  But a hundred veela were now gliding out onto the field, and Harry's question was answered for him.  Veela were women. . . the most beautiful women Harry had ever seen. . . except that they weren't - they couldn't be - human.  This puzzled Harry for a moment while he tried to guess what exactly they could be; what could make their skin shine moon-bright like that, or their white-gold hair fan out behind them without wind.. . but then the music started, and Harry stopped worrying about them not being human - in fact, he stopped worrying about anything at all. The veela had started to dance, and Harry's mind had gone completely and blissfully blank.  All that mattered in the world was that he kept watching the veela, because if they stopped dancing, terrible things would happen. And as the veela danced faster and faster, wild, half-formed thoughts started chasing through Harry's dazed mind.  He wanted to do something very impressive, right now.  Jumping from the box into the stadium seemed a good idea. . . but would it be good enough? \"Harry, what are you doing?\" said Hermione's voice from a long way off. The music stopped.  Harry blinked. He was standing up, and one of his legs was resting on the wall of the box.  Next to him, Ron was frozen in an attitude that looked as though he were about to dive from a springboard. Angry yells were filling the stadium. The crowd didn't want the veela to go. Harry was with them; he would, of course, be supporting Bulgaria, and he wondered vaguely why he had a large green shamrock pinned to his chest.  Ron, meanwhile, was absentmindedly shredding the shamrocks on his hat.  Mr. Weasley, smiling slightly, leaned over to Ron and tugged the hat out of his hands. \"You'll be wanting that,\" he said, \"once Ireland have had their say.\" \"Huh?\"  said Ron, staring openmouthed at the veela, who had now lined up along one side of the field. Hermione made a loud tutting noise.  She reached up and pulled Harry back into his seat. \"Honestly!\"  she said. \"And now,\" roared Ludo Bagman's voice, \"kindly put your wands in the air. . . for the Irish National Team Mascots!\" Next moment, what seemed to be a great green-and-gold comet came zooming into the stadium.  It did one circuit of the stadium, then split into two smaller comets, each hurtling toward the goal posts.  A rainbow arced suddenly across the field, connecting the two balls of light.  The crowd oooohed and aaaaahed, as though at a fireworks display.  Now the rainbow faded and the balls of light reunited and merged; they had formed a great shimmering shamrock, which rose up into the sky and began to soar over the stands.  Something like golden rain seemed to be falling from it - \"Excellent!\"  yelled Ron as the shamrock soared over them, and heavy gold coins rained from it, bouncing off their heads and seats.  Squinting up at the shamrock, Harry realized that it was actually comprised of thousands of tiny little bearded men with red vests, each carrying a minute lamp of gold or green. \"Leprechauns!\" said Mr. Weasley over the tumultuous applause of the crowd, many of whom were still fighting and rummaging around under their chairs to retrieve the gold. \"There you go,\" Ron yelled happily, stuffing a fistful of gold coins into Harry's hand, \"for the Omnioculars!  Now you've got to buy me a Christmas present, ha!\" The great shamrock dissolved, the leprechauns drifted down onto the field on the opposite side from the veela, and settled themselves cross-legged to watch the match. \"And now, ladies and gentlemen, kindly welcome - the Bulgarian National Quidditch Team!  I give you - Dimitrov!\" A scarlet-clad figure on a broomstick, moving so fast it was blurred, shot out onto the field from an entrance far below, to wild applause from the Bulgarian supporters."
