After  the feast (more or less) came the  Speech. Most of  the  company  were, however, now in a tolerant  mood, at that  delightful stage which they  called 'filling up  the corners'.  They were sipping their favourite drinks,   and nibbling at  their favourite  dainties, and their fears  were forgotten.  They were prepared to listen to anything, and to cheer at every full stop.       My dear People, began Bilbo, rising in  his  place. 'Hear! Hear! Hear!'  they shouted,  and  kept on repeating  it  in chorus,  seeming  reluctant to   ####-follow their own advice. Bilbo left  his place and went and stood on a chair  under the illuminated  tree. The  light of the lanterns fell on his  beaming  face; the golden buttons shone on his embroidered silk waistcoat. They could  all see  him standing,  waving  one hand in  the air,  the other  was in his  trouser-pocket.       My dear Bagginses and Boffins, he began again;  and my  dear  Tooks and  Brandybucks, and Grubbs,  and  Chubbs,  and Burrowses,  and Hornblowers,  and  Bolgers, Bracegirdles, Goodbodies, Brockhouses and Proudfoots.   'ProudFEET!'  shouted  an  elderly  hobbit  from  the back  of the pavilion.  His name, of  course, was  Proudfoot, and well merited; his feet were large, exceptionally  furry, and both were on the table.       Proudfoots,  repeated Bilbo. Also my  good  Sackville -Bagginses that  I  welcome  back at last  to  Bag  End. Today  is my  one  hundred and eleventh   birthday: I am eleventy -one  today! 'Hurray!  Hurray! Many  Happy  Returns!'  they  shouted, and they  hammered  joyously  on the tables.  Bilbo was doing  splendidly. This was the sort of stuff they liked: short and obvious.        / hope you  are  all  enjoying yourselves as much as  I  am.  Deafening  cheers. Cries  of  Yes  (and  No). Noises  of trumpets and horns, pipes  and  flutes,  and  other musical instruments.  There were, as has been said, many  young hobbits present. Hundreds of musical crackers had been pulled. Most of  them bore the  mark DALE  on them; which did not  convey much to most of  the  hobbits, but they all agreed they were  marvellous crackers.  They contained  instruments, small, but of perfect make and enchanting tones. Indeed, in one  corner some of  the young Tooks and  Brandybucks, supposing Uncle  Bilbo  to  have finished (since he had plainly said all that was necessary), now got up  an impromptu orchestra, and began a  merry dance-tune.  Master  Everard Took   and  Miss Melilot Brandybuck  got on a  table  and with bells in their hands  began to dance the Springle-ring: a pretty dance, but rather vigorous.       But Bilbo had not finished. Seizing a horn from a youngster near by, he  blew  three loud  hoots. The noise subsided. /  shall not keep you  long, he  cried. Cheers from all the assembly. /  have called  you all  together for a   Purpose. Something in  the way  that he said this made an impression.  There  was almost silence, and one or two of the Tooks pricked up their ears.       Indeed,  for  Three  Purposes! First of  all,  to  tell  you that  I am   ####-immensely fond  of  you all, and that eleventy -one years is too short a time  to live among such  excellent and  admirable hobbits. Tremendous outburst of  approval.       / don't know half of you half as well as I should like; and I like less  than half of you half as well as you deserve. This was unexpected and rather   difficult. There  was some scattered clapping, but most of  them were trying  to work it out and see if it came to a compliment.       Secondly,  to  celebrate my birthday.  Cheers again.  / should say: OUR  birthday.  For it  is, of  course, also the birthday of my  heir and nephew,   Frodo.  He comes  of  age  and into his inheritance today. Some  perfunctory  clapping by the  elders;  and some loud  shouts of 'Frodo!  Frodo! Jolly old  Frodo,' from the juniors. The Sackville-Bagginses scowled, and wondered what  was  meant by 'coming  into his inheritance'. Together we score one  hundred   and forty -four.  Your numbers were chosen to  fit this remarkable total: One  Gross, if I  may use the  expression. No cheers. This was ridiculous. Many of  his guests, and especially  the Sackville-Bagginses, were insulted,  feeling  sure they had only been asked to fill up the  required number, like goods in  a package. 'One Gross, indeed! Vulgar expression.'       It is also,  if  I  may be  allowed to  refer to  ancient history,  the  anniversary of my arrival by barrel at Esgaroth on the Long Lake; though the  fact that it was  my birthday slipped  my memory on that occasion. I was only   fifty-one  then,  and birthdays did  not seem so important.  The banquet was   very splendid, however, though I had a bad cold at the time, I remember, and  could only say 'thag you very  buch'."
