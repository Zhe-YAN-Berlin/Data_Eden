He  spoke lightly;  but his heart was  moved  suddenly with  a desire to see the  house of Elrond  Halfelven, and  breathe the  air  of that deep valley where  many of the Fair Folk still dwelt in peace.       One summer's evening an astonishing piece of news  reached the Ivy Bush  and Green Dragon. Giants and other portents on the borders of the Shire were  forgotten for more important matters: Mr. Frodo was  selling Bag End, indeed  he had already sold it - to the Sackville-Bagginses!        'For a nice bit, loo,' said some.  'At a bargain price,'  said  others,   'and that's more likely when Mistress Lobelia's  the  buyer.' (Otho had died  some years before, at the ripe but disappointed age of 102.)       Just  why  Mr.  Frodo  was selling  his  beautiful hole was  even  more  debatable than the price. A  few held the theory - supported by the nods and   hints  of Mr. Baggins himself  - that Frodo's money was  running out: he  was  going to leave Hobbiton and live in a  quiet way on the proceeds of the sale  down  in  Buckland  among   his  Brandybuck  relations.  'As  far  from  the  Sackville-Bagginses  as may be,'  some added.  But  so firmly fixed  had the  notion of  the immeasurable wealth  of the Bagginses of Bag End  become that  most found this  hard to believe, harder than  any  other reason or unreason  that  their fancy  could suggest:  to  most  it suggested  a  dark  and  yet   ####-unrevealed plot by Gandalf. Though he kept himself very quiet and did not go  about by day, it was well known that he was 'hiding up in the  Bag End'. But  however a removal might  fit in with the  designs of his wizardry, there was  no doubt about the fact: Frodo Baggins was going back to Buckland.       'Yes, I shall be moving  this autumn,' he  said.  'Merry Brandybuck  is  looking out  for a nice little hole for me, or perhaps a small house.'       As a matter of fact with  Merry's help he had already chosen and bought  a little house  at Crickhollow in the country beyond Bucklebury. To all  but  Sam he pretended he was going to settle down there permanently. The decision  to set out eastwards had suggested the idea to him; for Buckland was on  the  eastern borders  of  the Shire, and as he had lived there  in childhood  his  going back would at least seem credible.       Gandalf  stayed in the Shire for over two months.  Then one evening, at  the end of  June, soon  after Frodo's  plan  had  been finally  arranged, he  suddenly  announced that  he was going off  again next morning.  'Only for a  short  while, I hope,'  he said.  'But  I am  going down beyond the southern  borders to get some news, if I can. I have been idle longer than I should.'       He spoke lightly, but it seemed to Frodo that he looked rather worried.  'Has anything happened?' he asked.       'Well no; but I have heard something that has made me anxious and needs  looking into. If I think it necessary after all  for you to get off at once,  I shall come back immediately, or at least send word. In the meanwhile stick   to your plan; but be more careful than ever, especially of the  Ring.  Let me  impress on you once more: don't use it!'        He  went off at dawn.  'I may be back any day,'  he  said. 'At the very  latest I shall come back  for  the farewell party. I think after all you may  need my company on the Road.'       At first  Frodo  was a  good deal  disturbed,  and wondered often  what  Gandalf could  have  heard; but his  uneasiness wore  off, and in  the  fine   weather  he forgot his  troubles for a  while. The  Shire had seldom seen so  fair a summer, or so rich an autumn: the trees were laden with apples, honey  was dripping in the combs, and the corn was tall and full.       Autumn was well under  way  before  Frodo began to worry  about Gandalf  again.  September  was  passing  and there  was  still no  news of him.  The  Birthday, and the removal, drew  nearer, and still he did not come,  or send  word.  Bag End began to be busy.  Some of Frodo's friends  came  to stay and  help  him with the packing: there was Fredegar Bolger and Folco  Boffin, and   ####-of course his special friends Pippin Took and Merry Brandybuck. Between  them  they turned the whole place upside-down.       On  September  20th  two  covered  carts  went off  laden  to Buckland,  conveying  the furniture and goods that Frodo had not  sold to his new home,  by way of the  Brandywine Bridge. The next day Frodo became  really anxious,  and kept  a constant look -out  for  Gandalf. Thursday, his birthday morning,   dawned as fair and  clear  as it had long ago for Bilbo's great party. Still  Gandalf did not appear. In the evening Frodo gave his farewell feast: it was  quite small, just  a  dinner  for himself  and his four helpers; but  he was  troubled and fell in no mood for it. The thought  that he would so soon have  to part  with his young  friends weighed  on his heart."
