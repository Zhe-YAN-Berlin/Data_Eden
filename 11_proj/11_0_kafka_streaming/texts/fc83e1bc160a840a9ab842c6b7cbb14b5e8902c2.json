Then an idea came into his mind.  He  tiptoed away, found a large stone, and   came back.       Quickly now he drew off the cloth, wrapped the stone in it and kneeling  down, laid it back by the wizard's hand. Then at last he looked at the thing  that he had uncovered. There it was: a smooth globe of crystal, now dark and  dead, lying bare before his knees. Pippin lifted it, covered it hurriedly in  his own cloak, and half turned to go back to his bed. At that moment Gandalf  moved in his sleep, and muttered some words: they seemed  to be in a strange  tongue; his hand groped  out  and clasped the  wrapped stone, then he sighed   and did not move again.       'You  idiotic fool!' Pippin muttered  to himself. 'You're going  to get  yourself into frightful  trouble. Put it back quick!'  But he found now that  his knees  quaked, and he did not  dare to  go  near enough to the wizard to  reach  the  bundle.  'I'll never get  it back  now without  waking  him,' he  thought, 'not till I'm a bit calmer. SÂ¢ I may as well have a look first. Not  just  here though!'  He stole away, and sat down on a green hillock not  far  from his bed. The moon looked in over the edge of the dell.       Pippin sat with his knees drawn up and the ball  between  them. He bent  low over it, looking like a greedy  child stooping over a bowl of food, in a   corner away from  others. He drew his cloak aside and gazed at  it. The  air  seemed still and tense about him. At first the globe was dark, black as jet,   ####-with the moonlight gleaming on its surface. Then ther e came a faint glow and  stir in the heart of it, and it held his eyes, so that now he could not look   away. Soon all  the inside  seemed on fire;  the ball  was spinning,  or the  lights within were  revolving. Suddenly the lights went out.  He gave a gasp   and struggled; but  he  remained bent,  clasping the ball  with  both hands.   Closer and closer he bent, and then became rigid; his lips moved soundlessly  for a while. Then with a strangled cry he fell back and lay still.       The cry was  piercing. The guards  leapt down from  the banks.  All the  camp was soon astir.       'So this is the thief!' said Gandalf.  Hastily  he cast his  cloak over   the  globe where  it lay.  'But  you, Pippin!  This is a  grievous  turn  to  things!' He knelt by  Pippin's body: the hobbit was lying on his back rigid,  with unseeing eyes staring up at the sky. 'The devilry! What mischief has he   done-to himself, and to all of us?' The wizard's face was drawn and haggard.        He took Pippin's hand and bent over his face, listening for his breath;  then he laid  his hands on his brow.  The hobbit shuddered. His eyes closed.   He cried  out;  and sat  up. staring in bewilderment at all the  faces round  him, pale in the moonlight.       'It is not for you, Saruman!' he  cried in a shrill and toneless  voice  shrinking away from Gandalf. 'I will send for it at once. Do you understand?   Say just that!' Then he struggled to get up and escape but Gandalf held  him  gently and firmly.       'Peregrin Took!' he said. 'Come back!'       The  hobbit relaxed  and  fell  back,  clinging  to  the wizard's hand.  'Gandalf!' he cried. 'Gandalf! Forgive me!'       'Forgive you?' said the wizard. 'Tell me first what you have done!'       'I, I  took  the  ball  and looked at it,' stammered Pippin; 'and I saw  things that frightened me. And I wanted to go away, but I couldn't. And then  he came  and questioned  me; and  he looked  at me, and,  and  that is all I  remember.'       'That won't  do,' said Gandalf sternly. 'What did you see, and what did  you say?'       Pippin shut his eyes and shivered, but said nothing. They all stared at  him in  silence, except Merry who turned away. But  Gandalf's face was still   hard.  'Speak!' he said.       In a low hesitating voice Pippin began again, and slowly his words grew  clearer  and  stronger. 'I saw a  dark sky, and tall battlements,' he  said.   ####-'And tiny  stars. It seemed very far away and long ago, yet hard and  clear.  Then the stars went in and out-they were  cut off by things with wings. Very  big, I think, really; but  in the glass they looked like bats wheeling round  the tower. I  thought  there  were nine of them.  One  began to fly straight  towards  me, getting bigger and bigger. It had a horrible -- no, no! I can't   say.       'I tried to get  away, because I thought  it would fly out; but when it  had covered all the globe, it disappeared. Then he came. He did not speak so   that I could hear words. He just looked, and I understood.       '\"So you have come back? Why have you neglected to report for so long?\"       'I did not answer. He said: \"Who are you?\" I still did not answer,  but  it hurt me horribly; and he pressed me, so I said: \"A hobbit.\"       'Then suddenly he seemed to see me, and he laughed at me."
