We ought  to think of taking cover somewhere for  the  night.  After all we're only four, even if we are armed.'       'I've an idea,' said  Sam.  'Let's go  to old  Tom Cotton's down  South  Lane! He  always was a  stout fellow. And he has a lot of lads that were all  friends of mine.'       'No!'  said Merry.  'It's  no good \"getting under cover\".  That is just   what people have been  doing, and just what these  ruffians like.  They will  simply come  down on us in force, corner us, and  then drive us out, or burn  us in. No, we have got to do something at once.'       'Do what?' said Pippin.       'Raise the Shire!' said Merry. 'Now! Wake all our people! They hate all  this, you can  see: all of them except perhaps one or two rascals, and a few  fools that want to be important, but  don't at all understand what is really  going  on. But Shire-folk have  been  so comfortable so long they don't know  what to  do. They just want  a match, though, and they'll go up in fire. The  Chief's Men must know that. They'll try to stamp on us and put us out quick.  We've only got a very short time.   ####-     'Sam, you can make  a  dash for  Cotton's  farm, if  you like. He's the  chief person round here,  and the sturdiest. Come on! I am going to blow the  horn of Rohan, and give them all some music they have never heard before.'       They rode back to the middle of the village. There Sam turned aside and  galloped off down the  lane that led south to Cotton's.  He had not gone far  when he heard a sudden clear horn-call go up ringing  into the sky. Far over   hill and field it echoed; and  so compelling  was that call that Sam himself  almost turned and dashed back. His pony reared and neighed.       'On, lad! On!' he cried. 'We'll be going back soon.'       Then  he heard  Merry  change the  note, and  up went the  Horn-cry  of  Buckland, shaking the air.       Awake! Awake! Fear, Fire, Foes! Awake!       Fire, Foes! Awake!       Behind him Sam heard a hubbub of voices and a great din and slamming of  doors. In front of him lights sprang out in  the gloaming; dogs barked; feet  came running. Before he got  to the lane's end there was Farmer Cotton  with  three  of his lads, Young Tom,  Jolly, and Nick,  hurrying towards him. They  had axes in their hands, and barred the way.       'Nay! It's not one of them ruffians,' Sam heard the farmer say. 'It's a   hobbit by the size of it, but all dressed up queer. Hey!' he cried. 'Who are  you, and what's all this to-do? '       'It's Sam, Sam Gamgee. I've come back.'       Farmer Cotton came up close  and stared at him in the twilight. 'Well!'  he exclaimed. 'The voice is right, and your face is  no worse  than  it was,   Sam. But  I should a' passed you in the street in that gear. You've been  in  foreign parts, seemingly. We feared you were dead.'       'That I ain't!'  said Sam.  'Nor Mr. Frodo. He's here and  his friends.  And  that's  the to-do. They're raising the Shire. We're going to clear  out  these ruffians, and their Chief too. We're starting now.'       'Good, good!' cried Farmer Cotton.  'So  it's  begun at last! I've been  itching for trouble all this year, but folks wouldn't help. And I've had the  wife  and Rosie to think of. These ruffians don't stick at nothing. But come  on now, lads! Bywater is up! We must be in it!'       'What about Mrs.  Cotton and Rosie?' said Sam. 'It  isn't safe  yet for   them to be left all alone.'       'My Nibs  is  with them. But you  can  go and help him,  if you  have a   mind,' said Farmer Cotton with a grin. Then  he and his sons ran off towards   ####-the village.       Sam hurried  to  the house. By the  large round  door at the top of the  steps  from the wide yard stood  Mrs. Cotton and Rosie, and Nibs in front of  them grasping a hay-fork.       'It's  me!' shouted Sam  as he trotted up.  'Sam Gamgee! So  don't  try  prodding me, Nibs. Anyway, I've a mail -shirt on me.'       He  jumped down from his pony and went up the steps. They stared at him  in silence.  'Good evening, Mrs. Cotton!' he said.  'Hullo Rosie!'       'Hullo, Sam!' said Rosie. 'Where've you been I They said you were dead;   but I've been expecting you since the Spring. You haven't hurried have you?'       'Perhaps  not,'  said Sam abashed. 'But I'm hurrying now. We're setting  about the ruffians, and I've got to get back to Mr. Frodo. But I thought I'd  have a look and see how Mrs. Cotton was keeping, and you, Rosie.'       'We're keeping nicely, thank you,' said Mrs. Cotton.  'Or should be, if  it weren't for these thieving ruffians.'       'Well, be  off with you!' said Rosie. 'If you've been looking after Mr.  Frodo all this while, what d'you want  to leave  him for, as soon  as things  look dangerous?'       This  was  too much  for Sam. It  needed a  week's answer, or none."
