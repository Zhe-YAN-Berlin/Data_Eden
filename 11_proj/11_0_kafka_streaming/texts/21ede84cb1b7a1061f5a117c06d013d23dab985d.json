  "text": "  Summer?  asked Jojen, listening.   No.  Bran knew the voice of his direwolf.   Are you certain?  said the little grandfather.   Certain.  Summer had wandered far afield today, and would not be back till dawn. Maybe Jojen dreams green, but he can’t tell a wolf from a direwolf. He wondered why they all listened to Jojen so much. He was not a prince like Bran, nor big and strong like Hodor, nor as good a hunter as Meera, yet somehow it was always Jojen telling them what to do.  We should steal horses like Meera wants,  Bran said,  and ride to the Umbers up at Last Hearth.  He thought a moment.  Or we could steal a boat and sail down the White Knife to White Harbor town. That fat Lord Manderly rules there, he was friendly at the harvest feast. He wanted to build ships. Maybe he built some, and we could sail to Riverrun and bring Robb home with all his army. Then it wouldn’t matter who knew I was alive. Robb wouldn’t let anyone hurt us.    Hodor!  burped Hodor.  Hodor, hodor.   He was the only one who liked Bran’s plan, though. Meera just smiled at him and Jojen frowned. They never listened to what he wanted, even though Bran was a Stark and a prince besides, and the Reeds of the Neck were Stark bannermen.   Hoooodor,  said Hodor, swaying.  Hooooooodor, hoooooodor, hoDOR, hoDOR, hoDOR.  Sometimes he liked to do this, just saying his name different ways, over and over and over. Other times, he would stay so quiet you forgot he was there. There was never any knowing with Hodor.  HODOR, HODOR, HODOR!  he shouted.  He is not going to stop, Bran realized.  Hodor,  he said,  why don’t you go outside and train with your sword?   The stableboy had forgotten about his sword, but now he remembered.  Hodor!  he burped. He went for his blade. They had three tomb swords taken from the crypts of Winterfell where Bran and his brother Rickon had hidden from Theon Greyjoy’s ironmen. Bran claimed his uncle Brandon’s sword, Meera the one she found upon the knees of his grandfather Lord Rickard. Hodor’s blade was much older, a huge heavy piece of iron, dull from centuries of neglect and well spotted with rust. He could swing it for hours at a time. There was a rotted tree near the tumbled stones that he had hacked half to pieces.  Even when he went outside they could hear him through the walls, bellowing  HODOR!  as he cut and slashed at his tree. Thankfully the wolfswood was huge, and there was not like to be anyone else around to hear.   Jojen, what did you mean about a teacher?  Bran asked.  You’re my teacher. I know I never marked the tree, but I will the next time. My third eye is open like you wanted…    So wide open that I fear you may fall through it, and live all the rest of your days as a wolf of the woods.    I won’t, I promise.    The boy promises. Will the wolf remember? You run with Summer, you hunt with him, kill with him… but you bend to his will more than him to yours.    I just forget,  Bran complained.  I’m only nine. I’ll be better when I’m older. Even Florian the Fool and Prince Aemon the Dragonknight weren’t great knights when they were nine.    That is true,  said Jojen,  and a wise thing to say, if the days were still growing longer… but they aren’t. You are a summer child, I know. Tell me the words of House Stark.    Winter is coming.  Just saying it made Bran feel cold.  Jojen gave a solemn nod.  I dreamed of a winged wolf bound to earth by chains of stone, and came to Winterfell to free him. The chains are off you now, yet still you do not fly.    Then you teach me.  Bran still feared the three-eyed crow who haunted his dreams sometimes, pecking endlessly at the skin between his eyes and telling him to fly.  You’re a greenseer.    No,  said Jojen,  only a boy who dreams. The greenseers were more than that. They were wargs as well, as you are, and the greatest of them could wear the skins of any beast that flies or swims or crawls, and could look through the eyes of the weirwoods as well, and see the truth that lies beneath the world.   The gods give many gifts, Bran. My sister is a hunter. It is given to her to run swiftly, and stand so still she seems to vanish. She has sharp ears, keen eyes, a steady hand with net and spear. She can breathe mud and fly through trees. I could not do these things, no more than you could. To me the gods gave the green dreams, and to you… you could be more than me, Bran. You are the winged wolf, and there is no saying how far and high you might fly… if you had someone to teach you. How can I help you master a gift I do not understand? We remember the First Men in the Neck, and the children of the forest who were their friends… but so much is forgotten, and so much we never knew.   Meera took Bran by the hand.  If we stay here, troubling no one, you’ll be safe until the war ends. You will not learn, though, except what my brother can teach you, and you’ve heard what he says. If we leave this place to seek refuge at Last Hearth or beyond the Wall, we risk being taken. You are only a boy, I know, but you are our prince as well, our lord’s son and our king’s true heir."
