  "text": "       Twelve more years passed. Each year the Bagginses  had given very lively  combined  birthday-parties  at  Bag  End;  but  now  it  was understood that  something  quite  exceptional was being planned  for that autumn.  Bilbo was  going  to  be  eleventy -one,  111,  a  rather  curious  number  and  a  very  respectable  age  for a hobbit (the Old Took  himself had only reached 130);  and Frodo was going to be thirty- three, 33) an important number: the date of  his 'coming of age'.        Tongues began to wag in  Hobbiton and Bywater; and rumour of the coming  event travelled all  over the Shire. The  history and character of Mr. Bilbo  Baggins became once again the  chief  topic of  conversation; and the  older   folk suddenly found their reminiscences in welcome demand.       No one  had  a  more attentive audience than old Ham  Gamgee,  commonly  known as  the  Gaffer. He held forth  at  The Ivy Bush,  a small inn on  the  Bywater road; and he spoke with some authority, for he had tended the garden  at Bag End for forty years, and had helped old Holman in the same job befor e  that. Now that he was himself  growing old  and stiff in the joints, the job  was mainly  carried on by his youngest son, Sam Gamgee. Both father  and son  were on very friendly  terms with Bilbo and  Frodo. They  lived  on the Hill   itself, in Number 3 Bagshot Row just below Bag End.       'A very nice  well-spoken  gentlehobbit  is  Mr.  Bilbo, as I've always  said,' the Gaffer declared. With perfect truth: for Bilbo was very polite to  him, calling him 'Master Hamfast', and consulting  him  constantly upon  the  growing  of vegetables  - in the matter of 'roots', especially  potatoes, the  Gaffer was recognized as the  leading authority  by all in the neighbourhood  (including himself).       'But  what about this Frodo that lives with  him?'  asked Old Noakes of  Bywater.  'Baggins is his name, but he's more than  half a  Brandybuck, they  say. It beats me why any Baggins  of  Hobbiton should go looking for a  wife  away there in Buckland, where folks are so queer.'       'And no  wonder they're queer,'  put  in  Daddy  Twofoot  (the Gaffer's  next-door neighbour),  'if they live  on  the wrong  side of the  Brandywine  River, and right agin  the Old Forest. That's a dark bad place, if half  the  tales be true.'       'You're right,  Dad!' said  the  Gaffer. 'Not  that  the Brandybucks of  Buck-land live in the Old Forest; but they're a queer breed, seemingly. They    ####-fool about  with boats on that big  river   - and that  isn't  natural. Small  wonder that trouble came of  it,  I say. But be that as it may, Mr. Frodo is  as nice a young hobbit  as you could wish to meet. Very much like Mr. Bilbo,  and in  more than  looks.  After all his  father  was  a Baggins.  A  decent  respectable hobbit was Mr. Drogo  Baggins; there  was never much to tell  of  him, till he was drownded.'       'Drownded?' said several  voices. They  had heard this and other darker   rumours before, of course; but  hobbits have a passion  for  family history,  and they were ready to hear  it again. 'Well, so they say,' said the Gaffer.  'You see: Mr. Drogo, he married poor Miss  Primula Brandybuck.  She  was  our  Mr. Bilbo's first cousin on the mother's side (her mother being the youngest  of the Old Took's  daughters); and Mr.  Drogo  was his second cousin. So Mr.  Frodo is his first and second cousin, once removed either way, as the saying  is,  if  you  follow me.  And Mr. Drogo was  staying at Brandy Hall with his  father -in-law, old Master Gorbadoc, as he often  did after his marriage (him  being partial to  his vittles,  and old  Gorbadoc keeping  a mighty generous  table); and he went out boating on the Brandywine River; and he and his wife  were drownded, and poor Mr. Frodo only a child and all. '       'I've heard they went on the water after dinner in the moonlight,' said  Old Noakes; 'and it was Drogo's weight as sunk the boat.'       'And I heard she pushed him in, and  he pulled her in after him,'  said  Sandyman, the Hobbiton miller.       'You shouldn't listen  to all you hear, Sandyman,' said the Gaffer, who  did not much like the miller. 'There isn't no  call to go ta lking of pushing  and pulling. Boats are quite tricky enough for those that sit  still without  looking  further for the cause of trouble. Anyway: there was this  Mr. Frodo   left  an  orphan  and  stranded,  as  you  might   say,  among  those  queer   Bucklanders,  being brought  up anyhow  in Brandy Hall. A regular warren, by  all accounts. Old Master Gorbadoc never had fewer than  a couple  of hundred  relations in  the place.  Mr. Bilbo  never did  a kinder  deed  than when he  brought the lad back to live among decent folk.       'But I  reckon it was a nasty shock for those Sackville-Bagginses. They   thought  they were going to get Bag End,  that time when he went off and was  thought to be dead.  And then he comes back and orders them off; and he goes  on living and living, and never looking a day older, bless him! And suddenly  he  produces  an  heir,  and  has  all  the  papers  made  out  proper."
