The   ####-other may walk free for a while, until we come nearer to our dwellings, down  in Egladil, in the Angle between the waters. '       This was not at  all to the liking of  Gimli.  `The  agreement was made  without my consent,' he said. `I will not walk blindfold, like a beggar or a   prisoner. And I am no spy.  My folk  have never had dealings with any of the  servants of the Enemy. Neither have we  done harm to the Elves. I am no more  likely to betray you than Legolas, or any other of my companions.'       'I  do not doubt you,' said Haldir. 'Yet this is our law. I am  not the  master of the law, and cannot set it aside. I  have done much in letting you   set foot over Celebrant.'       Gimli was  obstinate. He  planted his feet  firmly apart, and laid  his  hand upon the haft of his axe. 'I will go forward free,' he said, 'or I will  go back and seek my own land,  where I am known to be true of word, though I  perish alone in the wilderness.'       `You cannot go back,' said Haldir sternly. 'Now you have come thus far,  you must be  brought before the Lord and the Lady. They shall judge  you, to  hold  you or to  give you leave, as they  will. You cannot cross the  rivers  again, and behind you  there are now secret sentinels  that you cannot pass.   You would be slain before you saw them.'       Gimli  drew  his axe from his belt. Haldir and his companion bent their  bows. 'A plague on Dwarves and their stiff necks! ' said Legolas.        'Come!'  said Aragorn. `If I am still to lead this Company, you must do  as I bid. It is hard upon  the Dwarf to be thus singled  out. We will all be  blindfold, even Legolas. That will be best, though it will make  the journey  slow and dull.'       Gimli laughed  suddenly. `A  merry  troop of fools we  shall look! Will  Haldir lead us all on a string, like  many blind beggars with one dog? But I  will be content, if only Legolas here shares my blindness.'       `I am an Elf and a  kinsman here,' said Legolas, becoming angry  in his  turn.       `Now let us cry: \"a plague on the stiff necks of Elves!\"' said Aragorn.  `But the Company shall all fare alike. Come, bind our eyes Haldir! '       `I shall claim  full amends for every fall and  stubbed  toe, if you do  not lead us well,' said Gimli as they bound a cloth about his eyes.        'You will have no claim,' said  Haldir. `I shall lead you well, and the  paths are smooth and straight.'       `Alas for  the  folly  of these  days! '  said Legolas.  'Here  all  are   ####-enemies of the one Enemy, and yet I must  walk blind, while the sun is merry  in the woodland under leaves of gold!  '       `Folly it  may seem,' said Haldir. 'Indeed  in nothing is the power  of  the Dark Lord more clearly shown  than in the estrangement that  divides all   those who still oppose him.  Yet so little faith and trust do we find now in  the world beyond Lothlurien, unless maybe in  Rivendell, that we dare not by  our own  trust  endanger our  land. We live  now  upon  an island  amid many  perils, and our hands are more often upon the bowstring than upon the harp.        `The rivers long defended us, but they are a sure guard no more for the  Shadow has crept northward  all about  us. Some speak of departing, yet  for   that it already seems too  late. The mountains to the west are growing evil;  to the east the lands are waste, and full of Sauron's creatures; and  it  is  rumoured  that we cannot  now safely pass southward  through  Rohan, and the  mouths of the Great River are watched by the Enemy. Even if we could come  to  the shores of the Sea, we  should  find no  longer any shelter there. It  is  said that there are still havens of. the High Elves, but they are  far north  and west, beyond the land of  the Halflings.  But where  that may be, though  the Lord and Lady may know, I do not.'       `You ought  at  least to guess,  since you have seen  us,' said  Merry.  `There are Elf-havens west of my land, the Shire where Hobbits live.'       `Happy folk  are  Hobbits to dwell  near  the shores of the sea! ' said  Haldir. 'It is long indeed since any of my folk have looked on it, yet still  we remember it in song. Tell me of these havens as we walk.'       `I cannot,' said Merry. `I have never seen them.  I have never been out  of my own la nd before. And if I had known what the world outside was like. I  don't think I should have had the heart to leave it.'       `Not even to see fair Lothlurien? '  said Haldir.  'The world is indeed  full of peril, and in it there are many dark places; but still there is much  that is fair, and  though in all lands love is  now  mingled with  grief, it  grows perhaps the greater.       `Some there are among us  who sing that  the Shadow  will draw back and  peace shall come again.  Yet I do not believe  that  the world about us will  ever again be as it was of old, or the light of the Sun as it was aforetime."
