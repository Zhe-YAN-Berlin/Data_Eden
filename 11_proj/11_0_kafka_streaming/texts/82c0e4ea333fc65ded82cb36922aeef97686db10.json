'Not that I ever  heard,' said Pippin.  Frodo  was silent.  He  too was  gazing eastward along the road, as if he had never seen it  before. Suddenly  he spoke, aloud but as if to himself, saying slowly:       The Road goes ever on and on        Down from the door where it began.       Now far ahead the Road has gone,       And I must follow, if I can,       Pursuing it with weary feet,       Until it joins some larger way,       Where many paths and errands meet.       And whither then? I cannot say.       'That sounds  like a bit of old Bilbo's rhyming,' said Pippin. 'Or is it  one of your imitations? It does not sound altogether encouraging.'       'I don't know,' said Frodo. It came to me then, as  if I was making  it  up; but I  may have heard it long ago. Certainly it reminds  me very much of  Bilbo in the last years, before he went away. He used often to say there was  only  one  Road;  that it was like a great river: its  springs were at every  doorstep,  and every path was  its  tributary. \"It's  a dangerous  business,   Frodo, going out of your door,\" he used to say. \"You step into the Road, and  if you don't keep your feet,  there is no knowing where  you might  be swept   off to.  Do you realize  that  this  is the  very  path  that  goes  through   ####-Mirkwood,  and that if you  let it, it  might take you to the Lonely Mountain  or  even  further and to worse places?\"  He  used to say  that  on  the path  outside the  front door at  Bag End, especially  after he had been out for a   long walk.'       'Well,  the Road won't sweep me  a nywhere for an  hour  at least,' said  Pippin, unslinging his pack. The others followed his example,  putting their  packs against the bank and their  legs out  into the road. After a rest they  had a good lunch, and then more rest.       The sun was beginning to get  low and the light of afternoon was on the  land as they went down the hill. So far they had not met a soul on the road.  This way was not much used, being hardly fit for carts, and there was little  traffic to  the Woody End. They had been jogging along again for an hour  or  more when Sam  stopped a  moment as  if  listening. They were  now on  level  ground,  and  the  road  after  much  winding  lay  straight  ahead  through  grass-land sprinkled with tall trees, outliers of the approaching woods.        'I can hear a pony or a horse coming along the road behind,' said Sam.       They  looked back, but the turn of the  road prevented them from seeing  far. 'I wonder if that  is Gandalf coming after us,' said Frodo; but even as  he said it, he had a feeling  that it was not so, and a sudden desire to hide  from the view of the rider came over him.       'It  may not matter much,' he  said apologetically, 'but I would rather   not be seen on the  road  - by anyone. I am  sick of my  doings being noticed   and discussed. And if  it is Gandalf,' he added as  an afterthought, 'we can  give him  a little surprise, to pay him out for being so late. Let's get out  of sight!'       The other two ran quickly to the left and down into a little hollow not  far  from the  road. There  they lay  flat. Frodo  hesitated  for  a second:  curiosity or some other feeling was struggling with his desire  to hide. The  sound of hoofs drew nearer. Just in time he threw himself down in a patch of  long grass behind a tree that overshadowed the road. Then he lifted his head  and peered cautiously above one of the great roots.       Round the  corner came  a black horse, no hobbit-pony  but a full-sized  horse;  and  on  it sat  a large man,  who seemed to  crouch in  the saddle,  wrapped in a great black  cloak and  hood, so that only his boots in the high  stirrups showed below; his face was shadowed and invisible.       When it reached the  tree and was level with Frodo  the  horse stopped.  The riding figure sat quite still with its head bowed, as if listening. From   ####-inside the hood came  a  noise as of  someone sniffing to  catch an  elusive  scent; the head turned from side to side of the road.       A sudden  unreasoning  fear of  discovery laid hold  of Frodo,  and  he  thought  of his Ring. He hardly dared  to breathe,  and yet the desire to get  it out of his pocket became so strong that he began slowly to move his hand.  He felt  that  he had only to  slip  it on, and then he  would  be safe. The  advice of Gandalf seemed absurd. Bilbo had used the Ring. 'And I am still in  the Shire,' he thought, as his hand touched the chain on  which  it hung. At   that moment  the  rider  sat up,  and  shook the  reins.  The  horse stepped  forward, walking slowly at first, and then breaking into a quick trot.       Frodo crawled to  the edge of the road and watched the rider,  until he  dwindled into the distance. He could not be quite sure, but it seemed to him  that suddenly, before it  passed out  of sight,  the horse turned aside  and  went into the trees on the right."
