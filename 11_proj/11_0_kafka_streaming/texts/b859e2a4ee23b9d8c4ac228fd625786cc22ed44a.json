  "text": " 'The Lady of  the Wood! She  read many  hearts and  desires. Now why did  not we wish for some  of our own kinsfolk,  Legolas?'       Legolas stood before the gate and turned his bright eyes away north and  east, and his fair face was troubled. 'I do not  think that any would come,'  he answered. 'They have no need to ride to war; war already marches on their  own lands.'       For  a while the three companions walked together, speaking of this and  that turn of the battle, and they went down from the broken gate, and passed  the mounds of the fallen on the greensward beside the road, until they stood   on  Helm's  Dike  and  looked into the Coomb. The Death Down  already  stood  there, black and  tall and stony, and the great trampling and scoring of the  grass by the Huorns could be  plainly  seen. The Dunlendings and many men of  the garrison of the Burg were at work on the Dike or in the fields and about  the battered walls behind;  yet all seemed  strangely  quiet: a weary valley  resting after a  great storm. Soon they turned  back and went  to the midday  meal in the hall of the Burg.       The  king was already there, and as soon as they  entered he called for   Merry and  had a seat set for him at his side. 'It is not  as I  would  have  it,' said Thjoden; 'for this is little like  my  fair  house  in Edoras. And  your friend is gone, who should also be here. But it may be long ere we si t,  you and I, at the high table in Meduseld; there will be no time for feasting  when  I return  thither. But  come  now!  Eat and drink,  and  let us  speak  together while we may. And then you shall ride with me.'       'May I?' said Merry, surprised and delighted.  'That would be splendid!'  He had never felt more grateful for any kindness in words. 'I am afraid I am  only in everybody's way,' he stammered; 'but  I should like to do anything I  could, you know.'       'I doubt  it not,' said the king.  'I have had  a  good  hill -pony made  ready for you. He will  bear you as swift as any horse by the  roads that we  shall  take. For I will ride  from the  Burg  by mountain paths, not  by the  plain, and so come to Edoras by way of Dunharrow where the Lady Jowyn  awaits  me. You shall  be  my esquire,  if you  will.  Is  there gear of war in this  place, Jomer, that my sword-thain could use?'   ####-     'There are no great weapon -hoards here, lord.' answered Jomer. 'Maybe a   light helm might be found to fit him; but  we have no   mail or sword for one  of his stature.'       'I have a sword,' said Merry, climbing from his  seat, and drawing from  its black sheath his small bright blade. Filled suddenly with love  for this  old man, he knelt on one knee,  and took  his hand and kissed it. 'May I lay  the  sword  of  Meriadoc of the Shire on your lap Thjoden  King?' he  cried.  'Receive my service, if you will!'       'Gladly will I take it,' said the king; and laying his  long old  hands  upon  the brown hair  of the hobbit;  he blessed  him. 'Rise  now, Meriadoc,  esquire  of Rohan of the household of  Meduseld!' he said.  'Take your sword  and bear it unto good fortune!'       'As a father you shall be to me,' said Merry.       'For a little while,' said Thjoden.       They talked then together as they ate, until presently Jomer spoke. 'It  is near the hour that we set for our going, lord,' he said. 'Shall I bid men  sound the horns? But where is  Aragorn?  His place is empty and  he  has not  eaten.'       'We  will make ready to ride,'  said Thjoden; 'but let  word be sent to  the Lord Aragorn that the hour is nigh.'       The king with his guard and Merry at his side passed down from the gate  of  the Burg to  where the Riders were assembling  on  the green.  Many were  already mounted. It would be a   great company; for the king was leaving only  a small garrison in the Burg, and all who could be spared were riding to the  weapontake at  Edoras. A  thousand spears  had indeed already ridden away at  night; but still there would be some five hundred more  to go  with the king,  for the most part men from the fields and dales of Westfold.       A little  apart  the Rangers sat, silent,  in an ordered company, armed  with  spear and bow  and sword. They were  clad in  cloaks of dark grey, and  their hoods were ca st now over helm  and head. Their  horses were strong and  of  proud  bearing, but rough-haired; and  one stood there without  a rider,  Aragorn's own horse that they  had  brought from the North; Roheryn  was his  name. There was no gleam  of stone  or gold, nor any fair thing in all their  gear and harness: nor did their  riders bear any badge  or  token, save only  that each  cloak was  pinned  upon the  left shoulder by a brooch of  silver   shaped like a rayed star.       The  king mounted his horse, Snowmane,  and Merry sat beside him on his   ####-pony: Stybba was his name. Presently Jomer came out from the gate, and  with  him was Aragorn, and Halbarad bearing the great staff close-furled in black,  and two tall men, neither young nor old So much alike were they, the  sons of  Elrond,  that few could tell  them apart: dark-haired,  grey-eyed, and their  faces elven-fair,  clad  alike in bright mail beneath cloaks of silver -grey."
