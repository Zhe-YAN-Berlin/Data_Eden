He put  the bundle on the floor and with  his right claw  drew out a long red knife and spat on it.  Going to  the  parapet he  leaned  over, looking down into  the outer court far below.  Twice he shouted but no   ####-answer came.       Suddenly,  as Shagrat was stooped over the battlement, his back to  the  roof-top, Sam to  his amazement  saw  that one  of the  sprawling bodies was  moving. It  was  crawling. It  put out  a  claw and clutched the  bundle. It  staggered up. In its  other hand it  held a broad-headed spear  with a short  broken haft. It was poised for a stabbing thrust. But at that  very moment a   hiss  escaped  its teeth, a gasp of  pain or hate. Quick as a snake  Shagrat  slipped aside, twisted round, and drove his knife into his enemy 's throat.       `Got you, Gorbag!' he cried. 'Not quite dead, eh? Well, I'll finish  my  job now.' He sprang on to the  fallen  body, and stamped and trampled it  in  his  fury, stooping  now and  again to  stab and  slash  it with his  knife.  Satisfied  at last, he threw back  his head and let out a  horrible gurgling  yell of triumph. Then he licked his knife, and put it between his teeth, and  catching up the bundle he came loping towards the near door of the stairs.        Sam had no time  to think. He might have slipped out of the other door,  but  hardly without  being seen;  and he could not have played hide-and-seek  with this  hideous  orc for long. He did what was probably the best thing he  could have  done.  He sprang  out to  meet  Shagrat with a shout. He was  no  longer holding the Ring, but it was there, a hidden power, a  cowing  menace  to the slaves of Mordor; and in his hand was Sting, and its  light smote the  eyes  of  the   orc  like  the  glitter  of  cruel  stars  in  the  terrible  elf-countries,  the  dream  of which was a  cold fear to all  his  kind.  And  Shagrat could not  both fight and  keep hold  of his treasure.  He  stopped,  growling, baring his fangs. Then once more, orc-fashion, he leapt aside, and  as Sam  sprang at  him, using the heavy bundle as both shield and weapon, he  thrust it  hard into his  enemy's face. Sam staggered, and before  he  could  recover, Shagrat darted past and down the stairs.        Sam ran after him, cursing, but he did not go far.  Soon the thought of  Frodo returned  to him, and he remembered that the other  orc  had gone back  into the turret. Here was another  dreadful  choice, and he  had  no time to  ponder it. If Shagrat got away, he would soon get help and come back. But if  Sam  pursued him,  the  other orc might  do some horrible deed up there. And  anyway Sam might miss Shagrat or be killed by him. He turned quickly and ran  back up the  stairs. `Wrong again, I expect,' he sighed. `But it's my job to  go right up to the top first, whatever happens afterwards.'       Away below Shagrat went leaping  down the stairs and out over the court  and  through the gate,  bearing his precious burden. If Sam could have  seen   ####-him and known the grief that  his escape would bring, he might have quailed.  But now his mind was set on the last stage of his search. He came cautiously   to the turret-door and stepped inside. It opened into darkness. But soon his  staring  eyes were aware of a dim light at  his right hand. It came  from an  opening that led  to another stairway,  dark  and narrow: it appeared  to go  winding up the turret along the inside of its round outer wall. A  torch was  glimmering from somewhere up above.       Softly Sam began to climb. He came  to the guttering torch, fixed above  a door on his left that faced a window-slit looking out westward: one of the  red eyes that he and Frodo  had  seen from down below by the tunnel's mouth.  Quickly Sam passed the door and hurried on to the second storey, dreading at  any  moment to he  attacked and to feel throttling fingers seize  his throat  from behind. He came  next to a window looking east and another torch  above  the door to a passage through the middle  of the turret. The door  was open,  the passage  dark  save for the glimmer of  the torch and the red glare from  outside filtering through  the window-slit.  But here  the stair stopped and  climbed  no further. Sam crept into the passage.  On either side there was a   low door; both were closed and locked. There was no sound at all.       `A dead end,'  muttered Sam; `and after all my climb! This can't be the   top of the tower. But what can I do now?'       He ran back to the lower  storey and tried the door. It would not move.  He ran up again, and sweat began to trickle down his face. He felt that even  minutes were precious, but one by one they escaped; and he could do nothing.  He  cared  no  longer for Shagrat or Snaga  or any  other orc that  was ever  spawned. He longed  only for his master,  for one  sight of his face  or one  touch of his hand."
