'Alas!' he  cried. 'It was this accursed  knife  that gave the wound. Few now have the  skill in  healing to match  such evil   weapons. But I will do what I can.'       He sat down on the  ground, and taking  the dagger -hilt laid it  on his  knees, and he  sang over it a slow song in a strange tongue. Then setting it  aside, he turned to Frodo  and in  a soft tone  spoke words the others could  not catch.  From  the pouch at  his  belt he drew  out the  long leaves of a   plant.       'These  leaves,' he said, 'I have  walked far to  find; for  this plant  does not grow in the bare hills;  but in the thickets away south of the Road  I found it in the  dark by the scent of its leaves.' He crushed a leaf in his  fingers,  and it gave out  a  sweet and pungent fragrance. 'It  is fortunate  that  I could find it, for it is  a healing plant that the  Men of  the West  brought to Middle-earth. Athelas they  named it,  and it grows  now sparsely   ####-and only near places where they dwelt or camped of old;  and it is not known  in the  North, except to some of those who wander in the Wild. It  has great  virtues, but over such a wound as this its healing powers may be small.'       He threw the leaves into boiling water and bathed Frodo's shoulder. The  fragrance of the steam was refreshing, and those that were unhurt felt their  minds calmed and cleared. The herb had  also some  power over the wound, for   Frodo felt the pain   and also the  sense of  frozen cold lessen in his side;  but the life did not return to his arm, and  he could not  raise or  use his  hand.  He  bitterly  regretted his  foolishness, and reproached himself  for   weakness of will; for he now perceived that in putting on the Ring he obeyed  not his own desire but the commanding wish of his enemies. He wondered if he  would  remain maimed for  life,  and how they would now  manage to  continue  their journey. He fell too weak to stand.       The others were discussing this very question. They  quickly decided to  leave Weathertop as soon as possible. 'I think now,' said Strider, 'that the  enemy has been watching this place for some days. If Gandalf ever came here,  then he  must have been forced to ride away, and  he will not return. In any  case we are in great peril here after  dark, since the attack of last night,  and we can hardly meet greater danger wherever we go.'       As  soon  as  the  daylight  was  full, they had some hurried food  and  packed. It was impossible for Frodo  to  walk, so  they divided the  greater   part of their baggage among the four of them, and put Frodo  on the pony. In  the last few days the poor beast had improved wonderfully; it already seemed  fatter and stronger, and had begun to show an a ffection for its new masters,  especially for Sam. Bill Ferny's treatment must  have been very hard for the  journey in the wild to seem so much better than its former life.       They started off in a southerly direction. This would mean crossing the  Road,  but. it was the  quickest way to more wooded country. And they needed  fuel; for Strider said  that Frodo must be kept warm,  especially at  night,  while fire would be some protection  for them all. It  was also his  plan to  shorten their journey by cutting  across another great loop of the Road: east   beyond Weathertop it changed its course and took a wide bend northwards.       They made  their  way slowly  and  cautiously  round the  south-western  slopes  of the  hill, and came in a  little while to the  edge of the  Road.  There was no sign of the Riders. But  even as they were hurrying across they  heard far away two  cries: a cold voice calling and  a cold voice answering.  Trembling they sprang forward, and made for the thickets that lay ahead. The   ####-land before them  sloped  away  southwards, but  it was  wild  and pathless;  bushes and  stunted trees  grew in dense patches with wide barren  spaces in  between.  The grass was scanty, coarse,  and grey;  and  the leaves  in  the  thickets were faded and falling. It was  a cheerless land, and their journey  was slow and gloomy. They spoke  little as they trudged along. Frodo's heart  was grieved as he watched them walking beside him with their heads down,  and  their  backs bowed  under  their  burdens.  Even  Strider  seemed  tired and  heavy-hearted.       Before the first day's march was over Frodo's pain began to grow again,  but he did not speak of it for  a long time. Four  days passed,  without the  ground or the scene changing much, except that behind them Weathertop  slowly  sank,  and  before  them the distant mountains loomed a  little nearer.  Yet  since that far cry they had seen and heard no sign that the enemy had marked  their  flight or followed them.  They dreaded the dark hours, and kept watch  in pairs by night, expecting at any time to see black shapes stalking in the  grey night, dimly lit by the cloud-veiled  moon; but they  saw nothing,  and  heard no sound but the sigh of withered leaves and grass."
