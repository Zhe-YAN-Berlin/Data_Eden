And then he wept.       And all  the host laughed and wept, and in the midst of their merriment  and tears the clear voice of the minstrel rose like silver and gold, and all  men  were hushed. And he  sang to them, now in the  Elven-tongue, now in the  speech  of  the  West,  until   their  hearts,  wounded  with  sweet  words,  overflowed, and their joy was like swords, and they passed in thought out to  regions where pain and delight flow together and tears are the  ver y wine of  blessedness.        And at the last, as the Sun fell from the  noon and the  shadows of the  trees lengthened,  he  ended. 'Praise them  with  great praise!' he said and  knelt. And then Aragorn stood up, and all the host arose, and they passed to  pavilions made ready, to eat and drink and make merry while the day lasted.       Frodo and Sam were led apart and brought to a tent, and there their old  raiment was taken off, but folded and set aside with honour; and clean linen   was  given  to them. Then  Gandalf came and in his  arms,  to the  wonder of   Frodo, he  bore  the sword and the elven-cloak and the mithril-coat that had  been taken from him in Mordor. For Sam he brought a coat of gilded mail, and  his elven-cloak all healed of  the soils and hurts that it had suffered; and  then he laid before them two swords.       'I do not wish for any sword,' said Frodo.       'Tonight at least you should wear one,' said Gandalf.       Then Frodo took the small sword that had belonged to Sam, and had  been  laid at his side in Cirith Ungol. 'Sting I gave to you Sam,' he said.       'No, master!  Mr. Bilbo gave it  to you,  and  it goes with his  silver   coat; he would not wish anyone else to wear it now.'       Frodo gave way; and  Gandalf, as if  he  were their esquire, knelt  and  girt  the sword-belts about them, and  then rising he set circlets of silver   upon their heads. And when they were arrayed  they went  to the great feast;  and  they sat at the King's table with Gandalf, and King Jomer of Rohan, and   ####-the Prince Imrahil and all the chief captains; and there also were Gimli and  Legolas.        But  when, after the  Standing Silence, wine was brought there came  in  two esquires to  serve  the kings; or  so they seemed to be: one was clad in  the silver and sable of the Guards  of Minas Tirith, and the other  in white  and green. But Sam wondered  what such young boys were  doing in an  army  of  mighty men. Then suddenly  as they  drew near and he could see them plainly,  he exclaimed:       'Why, look Mr. Frodo! Look here! Well, if it isn't Pippin. Mr. Peregrin  Took I should say, and Mr.  Merry! How they have grown! Bless  me! But I  can  see there's more tales to tell than ours.'       'There  are indeed,' said Pippin turning towards him. 'And  we'll begin  telling them,  as soon  as this feast is ended. In the meantime you  can try  Gandalf. He's not so close as he used to be,  though he laughs now more than  he talks.  For the present Merry and I are busy.  We are knights of the City  and of the Mark, as I hope you observe.'       At  last the glad day ended; and  when  the Sun  was gone and the  round  Moon  rode  slowly  above  the  mists of  Anduin  and flickered through  the  fluttering  leaves,  Frodo and  Sam sat under the whispering  trees amid the  fragrance of fair Ithilien; and they talked deep into the  night  with Merry  and Pippin  and Gandalf, and after  a  while Legolas  and Gimli joined them.  There Frodo and  Sam learned much  of all that had happened to  the  Company  after their fellowship was broken on the  evil day  at Parth Galen by Rauros  Falls; and still there was always more to ask and more to tell.       Orcs, and talking  trees, and leagues of  grass,  and galloping riders.  and  glittering caves, and white towers and  golden halls, and  battles, and  tall  ships  sailing,  all  these  passed  before  Sam's  mind until he felt  bewildered.  But  amidst  all  these  wonders  he  returned  always  to  his  astonishment at the size of Merry and Pippin; and he made them stand back to  back with Frodo and himself. He scratched his head. 'Can't understand it  at  your  age!' he  said. 'But there it is: you're three  inches taller than you   ought to he, or I'm a dwarf.'       'That you certainly are not,' said  Gimli. 'But what did I say? Mortals  cannot go drinking ent-draughts and expect no more to come of them than of a   pot of beer.'   ####-     'Ent-draughts?' said Sam. 'There you go about Ents again; but what they  are beats me. Why, it  will take weeks before we  get all these things sized  up!'       'Weeks indeed,' said Pippin. 'And then Frodo will have  to be locked up  in a tower in Minas Tirith and  write it  all down. Otherwise he will forget  half of it, and poor old Bilbo will be dreadfully disappointed."
