'Mr. Frodo  Baggins  is a real gentlehobbit, I always have said, whatever  you may think   of some others of the name, begging your pardon. And I hope my Sam's  behaved  hisself and given satisfaction?'       'Perfect satisfaction, Mr. Gamgee,'  said Frodo. 'Indeed,  if you  will  believe it, he's  now one of the most famous  people  in all  the lands, and  they are making songs about his deeds from  here to  the Sea and beyond  the  Great River.' Sam blushed,  but he looked gratefully at Frodo,  for  Rosie's  eyes were shining and she was smiling at him.       'It takes a lot o' believing,' said  the gaffer, 'though I can see he's  been mixing in strange company. What's come of his weskit? I don't hold with  wearing ironmongery, whether it wears well or no.'       Farmer  Cotton's household  and  all  his  guests  were  up  early next  morning. Nothing  had  been  heard  in  the  night, but more  trouble  would  certainly  come before the  day was old.  'Seems as if none o' the  ruffians   ####-were left  up at Bag End,' said Cotton; 'but  the gang from Waymeet will  be  along any time now.'       After breakfast  a messenger from the Tookland rode in. He was in  high   spirits. 'The Thain has raised  all our country,' he said, 'and the news  is  going like fire all ways. The ruffians that were watching our land have fled  off south, those that escaped alive. The  Thain has gone after them, to hold  off the big gang down  that way; but he's sent Mr Peregrin back with all the  other folk he can spare.'       The next news  was less good. Merry, who had been out  all  night, came  riding in about ten  o'clock. 'There's a big band about four miles away,' he  said.  'They're  coming along the  road from Waymeet, but a good many  stray  ruffians have joined up with them. There must be close on a hundred of them;  and they're fire-raising as they come. Curse them!'       'Ah! This  lot  won't stay to  talk, they'll kill, if they  can,'  said  Farmer  Cotton.  'If Tooks don't come sooner, we'd best get behind cover and  shoot without  arguing.  There's  got to  be  some  fighting  before this is  settled, Mr. Frodo.'       The  Tooks  did come sooner.  Before long  they  marched in, a  hundred   strong,  from  Tuckborough and  the Green Hills with  Pippin at their  head.  Merry now  had  enough  sturdy  hobbitry to deal with  the  ruffians. Scouts  reported  that  they  were  keeping  close  together.  They  knew  that  the  countryside had risen against  them,  and  plainly  meant  to  deal with the  rebellion ruthlessly, at its centre in Bywater. But however grim they, might  be, they  seemed to have  no leader among  them who understood warfare.  They  came on without any precautions. Merry laid his plans quickly.       The ruffians  came tramping along  the  East Road, and  without halting  turned up the Bywater Road,  which ran for  some way sloping up between  high  banks with low hedges on top. Round a bend,  about a  furlong from  the main  road, they met a stout barrier of old farm-carts upturned. That halted them.  At the same  moment they  became aware that  the hedges on  both sides,  just  above their  heads, were all lined with hobbits. Behind them  other  hobbits  now pushed out  some more waggons  that had  been  hidden in a field, and so  blocked the way back. A voice spoke to them from above.       'Well, you  have walked into a trap, '  said Merry. 'Your  fellows  from  Hobbiton did the same, and one is dead and the  rest are prisoners. Lay down   ####-your weapons! Then  go  back twenty paces and sit down. Any who try to  break  out will be shot.'       But  the ruffians could  not now  be  cowed  so easily.  A few of  them  obeyed, but were immediately set on  by their fellows. A score or more broke  back  and  charged the waggons. Six were shot, but the  remainder burst out,  killing two hobbits, and then  scattering across country in the direction of  the  Woody End. Two more fell as they ran.  Merry blew a loud horn-call, and  there were answering calls from a distance.       'They won't get far,' said  Pippin. 'All that country is alive with our  hunters now.'       Behind,  the trapped Men in the lane,  still about four score, tried to  climb the barrier and the banks, and the hobbits were obliged  to shoot many   of them or hew them with axes. But many of the strongest and  most desperate  got out on the west side, and  attacked  their enemies  fiercely ,  being now  more  bent on killing than escaping. Several hobbits fell, and the rest were  wavering, when Merry and Pippin,  who were on the east side, came across and  charged  the ruffians. Merry himself slew  the  leader, a  great squint -eyed  brute like  a huge orc.  Then he drew  his forces off,  encircling the  last  remnant of the Men in a wide ring of archers.       At last all  was over."
