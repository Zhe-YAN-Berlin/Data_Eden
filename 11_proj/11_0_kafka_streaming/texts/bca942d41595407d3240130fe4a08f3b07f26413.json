I will send for it at once. Do you understand? Say just that!\"       'Then  he gloated over me. I felt  I was  falling  to pieces. No, no! I  can't say any more. I  don't remember anything else.'       'Look at me!' said Gandalf.       Pippin looked up straight into his eyes. The wizard held his gaze for a   moment  in silence. Then  his face grew  gentler, and the shadow  of a smile  appeared. He laid his hand softly on Pippin's head.       'All right!' he said. 'Say no more! You have taken no harm. There is no  lie in your eyes, as I feared. But  he did not speak long with you.  A fool,  but an honest  fool,  you remain, Peregrin Took. Wiser ones might  have done  worse  in such  a  pass. But mark this!  You  have  been saved, and all your  friends too, mainly by good fortune, as it is called. You cannot count on it  a second  time. If he had  questioned  you, then and there, almost certainly  you would have told all that you know, to the ruin of us all. But he was too  eager. He did not want information only: he wanted you,  quickly, so that he  could deal with you in the  Dark Tower, slowly.  Don't shudder! If  you will  meddle  in  the affairs  of Wizards, you  must  be prepared  to think of such  things. But come! I forgive you. Be comforted! Things have not turned out as  evilly as they might.'       He  lifted  Pippin  gently  and  carried  him  back to  his bed.  Merry  followed, and sat down beside him. Lie there and rest, if you can,  Pippin!'  said Gandalf. 'Trust me. If you feel an itch in your palms again, tell me of   ####-it!  Such things can be cured. But anyway, my dear hobbit, don't put  a lump   of  rock  under  my  elbow  again! Now, I will leave you  two together for a   while.'       With  that Gandalf  returned to the others, who  were still standing by  the  Orthanc-stone in troubled thought. 'Peril comes in the night when least  expected,' he said. 'We have had a narrow escape!'       'How is the hobbit, Pippin?' asked Aragorn.       'I think all  will  be well  now,' answered  Gandalf. 'He was  not held  long, and  hobbits have  an  amazing power of  recovery. The memory, or  the  horror of it, will probably fade  quickly. Too  quickly, perhaps. Will  you,  Aragorn, take the Orthanc-stone and guard it? It is a dangerous charge.'       'Dangerous indeed, but not to all,' said Aragorn. 'There is one who may  claim it by right.  For this assuredly  is the palantnr of Orthanc  from the  treasury  of  Elendil, set here by  the Kings  of Gondor. Now my hour  draws  near. I will take it.'       Gandalf looked  at Aragorn, and then, to the surprise of the others, he  lifted the covered Stone, and bowed as he presented it.       'Receive it,  lord!' he said: 'in earnest of other things that shall be  given back. But if I may counsel you in the use  of your own, do not use  it  -- yet! Be wary!'       'When have I been hasty or unwary, who have  waited and prepared for so  many long years?' said Aragorn.       'Never  yet.  Do not then  stumble at the end  of the  road,'  answered  Gandalf. 'But  at the least keep this thing secret. You, and all others that  stand  here! The hobbit, Peregrin,  above  all should not know  where it  is  bestowed.  The evil fit may come on him again. For alas! he  has  handled it   and  looked in it, as should never have  happened. He ought  never  to  have   touched it in Isengard,  and  there I should have been quicker. But my  mind  was bent  on Saruman, and I did not at once  guess the  nature of the Stone.  Then I was weary, and as I lay pondering it, sleep overcame me. Now I know!'       'Yes, there can  be no doubt,' said Aragorn. 'At last we know the link'  between Isengard and Mordor, and how it worked. Much is explained.' 'Strange  powers have our enemies, and strange  weaknesses!' said Thjoden. 'But it has  long been said: oft evil will shall evil mar. '       'That many times is seen,' said Gandalf. 'But at this time we have been  strangely fortunate. Maybe, I  have been  saved by this  hobbit from a grave  blunder. I  had considered whether or not to probe this Stone myself to find   ####-its uses. Had I done so, I should have been revealed to him myself. I am not   ready for such a  trial, if indeed I  shall ever be so:  But even if I found  the power to withdraw myself, it would be disastrous for  him to see me, yet   -- until the hour comes when secrecy will avail no longer.'       'That hour is now come, I think,' said Aragorn.       'Not yet,' said Gandalf. 'There remains a short while of doubt which we  must use. The Enemy, it is clear, thought that  the Stone was in  Orthanc  --  why should he not? And that therefore the hobbit  was captive there,  driven  to look in the  glass for his  torment by  Saruman.  That dark mind will  be  filled  now with  the voice  and face of the hobbit and with expectation: it  may take some time before he  learns his error."
