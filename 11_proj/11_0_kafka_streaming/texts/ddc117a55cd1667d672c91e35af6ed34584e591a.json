All was silent, save for the rumour of war in the City down  below, and  they heard the  water  dripping sadly  from  the dead branches into the  dark  pool. Then they went on through the Citadel gate, where the  sentinel stared   at  them in wonder and dismay as they passed by.  Turning westward they came  at length to  a door in the rearward wall of the sixth circle. Fen Hollen it  was called, for it was kept ever shut save at times of funeral, and only the  Lord of  the  City might use that  way, or those who  bore the token of  the  tombs and tended the houses of the  dead. Beyond it went a winding road that  descended in  many curves down  to the  narrow  land  under  the  shadow  of  Mindolluin's  precipice  where stood the mansions of the dead Kings  and  of  their Stewards.        A porter  sat in a  little house beside  the way,  and with fear in his  eyes he came  forth bearing  a lantern in his hand. At the Lord's command he  unlocked the door, and  silently it  swung  back; and  they passed  through,  taking  the lantern from his  hand. It was dark on the climbing road between  ancient  walls  and   many -pillared   balusters   looming  in  the   swaying  lantern-beam. Their  slow feet echoed as  they walked down,  down, until  at  last they came to  the Silent Street,  Rath  Dnnen, between  pale  domes and  empty halls and images of men long dead;  and they entered into the House of  the Stewards and set down their burden.       There  Pippin,  staring uneasily about  him, saw that he was in  a wide  vaulted chamber,  draped as it  were with the great shadows that  the little  lantern threw upon its shrouded  walls. And dimly to  be seen were many rows  of tables, carved of marble;  and upon each table lay a sleeping form, hands  folded, head pillowed upon stone. But one table near at hand stood broad and  bare. Upon it at a sign from Denethor they laid Faramir  and his father side  by side, and covered them with one covering, and stood then with bowed heads  as mourners beside a bed of death. Then Denethor spoke in a low voice.       'Here we will wait,' he said. 'But send not for the embalmers. Bring us  wood quick to  burn, and lay it all about us, and beneath; and pour oil upon  it. And when I bid you thrust in  a torch. Do this and speak no more to  me.  Farewell!'       'By your leave, lord!' said Pippin and turned and fled  in terror  from  the  deathly house. 'Poor Faramir!' he thought.  'I must find Gandalf.  Poor  Faramir!  Quite likely he needs medicine  more than  tears.  Oh, where can I   find Gandalf? In the thick of things, I suppose; and he will have no time to   ####-spare for dying men or madmen.'       At the door he turned to one  of the servants who had remained on guard  there.  'Your master is not himself,' he  said. 'Go slow! Bring  no fire  to  this place while Faramir lives! Do nothing until Gandalf comes!'       'Who is  the  master  of  Minas  Tirith?' the  man  answered. 'The Lord  Denethor or the Grey Wanderer?'       'The Grey Wanderer or no one, it would seem,' said Pippin, and he  sped  back and up the winding way as swiftly as his feet would carry him, past the  astonished porter, out through  the door, and on, till he came near the gate  of the Citadel. The sentinel hailed him as he went by, and he recognized the  voice of Beregond.       'Whither do you run, Master Peregrin?' he cried.       'To find Mithrandir,' Pippin answered.       'The Lord's errands are urgent and should not be hindered by me,'  said  Beregond;  'but tell  me quickly, if you may:  what goes forward? Whither has  my  Lord gone? I have just come on duty, but I  heard that he passed towards  the Closed Door, and men were bearing Faramir before him.'       'Yes,' said Pippin, 'to the Silent Street.'       Beregond bowed his  head  to  hide his tears.  'They said that  he  was  dying,' he sighed, 'and now he is dead.'       'No,' said Pippin, 'not yet. And even now his death might be prevented,  I think. But the Lord of  the City, Beregond,  has fallen before his city is  taken. He is fey and dangerous.' Quickly he told of Denethor's strange words  and deeds. 'I must find Gandalf at once.'       'Then you must go down to the battle.'       'I  know. The Lord has given me  leave. But,  Beregond, if you can,  do  someth ing to stop any dreadful thing happening.'       'The Lord  does not permit those who wear the black and silver to leave  their post for any cause, save at his own command.'       'Well,  you  must  choose between orders and the life of Faramir,' said  Pippin.   'And as for orders,  I think you  have a madman to deal with, not a   lord. I must run. I will return if I can.'       He ran on,  down, down towards the outer city. Men flying back from the  burning passed him, and some  seeing his livery turned  and shouted, but  he  paid no heed. At last he was through  the Second Gate,  beyond  which  great  fires  leaped up between the walls."
