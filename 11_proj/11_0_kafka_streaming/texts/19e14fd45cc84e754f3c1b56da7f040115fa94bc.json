And those were the  words that Elendil spoke when he came up out of the  Sea on the wings  of  the wind: 'Out of  the Great Sea to  M iddle-earth I am  come.  In this place will I abide,  and  my heirs, unto  the  ending of  the  world.'       Then to the wonder of many Aragorn did not put the crown upon his head,  but  gave it back to Faramir, and  said: 'By the labour and valour of many I  have come into my inheritance. In token of this I would have the Ring-bearer  bring the crown to me,  and let Mithrandir set it upon my  head, if he will;   ####-for he has been the mover of all that has been accomplished, and this is his  victory.'       Then Frodo  came forward and took the crown from Faramir and bore  it to  Gandalf; and Aragorn  knelt,  and Gandalf set the White Crown upon his head,  and said:       'Now  come  the days  of the  King, and may  they be blessed  while the  thrones of the Valar endure!'       But when  Aragorn arose  all that beheld him  gazed in  silence, for it  seemed to them  that he was revealed to them now for the first time. Tall as  the sea -kings of old, he stood  above all that were near; ancient of days he  seemed and yet in  the fl ower of manhood; and wisdom sat upon his brow,  and  strength and healing were in his hands, and a light was  about him. And then  Faramir cried:       'Behold the King!'       And  in that moment all the trumpets  were  blown, and the King Elessar   went  forth  and came to the barrier, and  H®rin  of the Keys thrust it back;  and amid the music of harp and of viol and of flute and the singing of clear  voices the  King passed through  the flower -laden streets,  and  came to the  Citadel,  and  entered  in;  and the banner  of  the Tree and the Stars  was  unfurled  upon the topmost tower,  and  the reign of King Elessar began,  of  which many songs have told.       In his time  the City was made more fair than it had ever been, even in  the  days of  its first  glory;  and it  was  filled  with  trees  and  with  fountains, and its gates were wrought of mithril  and steel, and its streets  were paved  with white marble; and the Folk of the Mountain laboured in  it,   and the Folk of the Wood rejoiced to come there; and all was healed and made  good, and  the  houses were filled with men  and women  and  the laughter of  children,  and no window was blind nor any courtyard  empty;  and after  the  ending  of  the Third  Age of  the world into the  new  age it preserved the  memory and the glory of the years that were gone.       In the days  that  followed his crowning  the King sat on his throne in  the Hall of the Kings and pronounced his judgements. And embassies came  from  many lands and peoples, from the East and the South, and from the borders of  Mirkwood,  and  from  Dunland  in  the  west.  And  the  King  pardoned  the  Easterlings that had  given themselves up, and sent them  away free, and  he  made peace with  the peoples of Harad;  and the slaves of Mordor he released   ####-and gave  to them all the lands about Lake N®rnen to be their own. And there  were  brought  before him many to  receive  his praise and reward  for their  valour; and  last the  captain  of the Guard brought to him  Beregond  to be  judged.       And  the  King said  to  Beregond: 'Beregond, by  your sword blood  was  spilled  in the Hallows, where that  is forbidden.  Also  you left your post   without leave of Lord or of Captain. For these things, of old, death was the  penalty. Now therefore I must pronounce your doom.       'All penalty  is remitted  for  your valour in battle,  and still  more  because all that you  did was for the love of the Lord Faramir.  Nonetheless  you must leave the Guard of the Citadel, and you must go forth from the City  of Minas Tirith.'       Then the blood left Beregond's face, and he was stricken to  the  heart  and bowed his head. But the King said.:       'So it must be,  for you are  appointed to the White Company, the Guard  of Faramir,  Prince of Ithilien, and you shall  be its captain  and dwell in  Emyn  Arnen in  honour  and peace, and in  the service of him  for whom  you   risked all, to save him from death.'       And then Beregond, perceiving the mercy  and justice  of the  King, was  glad,  and kneeling kissed his hand, and  departed  in joy  and content. And  Aragorn gave to Faramir Ithilien to  be his princedom, and bade him dwell in  the hills of Emyn Arnen within sight of the City.       'For,' said he, 'Minas Ithil in Morgul Vale shall be utterly destroyed,  and though it may in time to come be made clean,  no man may dwell there for   many long years.'       And last of  all Aragorn greeted Jomer of Rohan, and they embraced, and   Aragorn said: 'Between  us there can be no word of giving or taking,  nor of  reward; for we are brethren. In happy hour did Eorl ride from the North, and  never has  any league of peoples been more blessed, so that neither has ever   failed the other, nor shall fail."
