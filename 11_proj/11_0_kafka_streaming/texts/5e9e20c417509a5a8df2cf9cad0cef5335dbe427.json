It fed the will, and  it gave strength to endure, and to master   sinew  and limb beyond the measure of mortal  kind. But  now a  new decision  must be  made. They could not follow  this road any  longer; for  it went on  eastward  into  the  great Shadow, but the Mountain  now  loomed  upon their  right, almost due south, and they must turn towards it. Yet  still before it  there stretched a wide region of fuming, barren, ash-ridden land.       'Water, water!'  muttered  Sam.  He had  stinted  himself,  and in  his  parched mouth his tongue seemed thick and swollen; but for all his care they   now  had  very little left, perhaps half  his bottle, and  maybe there  were  still days to go.  All would long ago have been spent, if they had not dared  to follow the  orc-road. For at long intervals on that highway  cisterns had  been built  for  the use  of troops  sent in  haste  through  the  waterless  regions. In one  Sam had found some water left, stale, muddied by  the orcs,   but still sufficient  for their desperate case. Yet that was now a  day ago.   ####-There was no hope of any more.       At last  wearied with his cares Sam drowsed, leaving the morrow till it  came; he could do no more. Dream and waking mingled uneasily. He saw   lights  like gloating yes, and dark creeping shapes, and he heard noises as of  wild  beasts  or  the dreadful cries of tortured things; and he would start  up to  find the world all dark and only  empty b lackness all about him. Once  only,   as he stood and stared wildly round,  did it seem that, though now awake, he  could still see pale lights like eyes; but soon they flickered and vanished.       The hateful night  passed  slowly  and  reluctantly. Such  da ylight  as  followed was dim; for here as the Mountain drew near the air was ever mirky,  while  out  from the Dark Tower  there crept the veils of Shadow that Sauron  wove about himself. Frodo was lying on his back not moving. Sam stood  beside  him, reluctant  to speak, and yet knowing that the word now lay with him:  he  must set his  master's will to work for another effort. At  length, stooping  and caressing Frodo's brow, he spoke in his ear.       'Wake up, Master!' he said. 'Time for another start.'       As   if roused by a sudden  bell,  Frodo rose quickly,  and stood up and  looked away southwards; but when his eyes beheld the Mountain and the desert  he quailed again.       'I can't manage it, Sam,' he said. 'It is such a weight to carry,  such  a weight.'       Sam knew before he spoke, that  it was vain, and that  such words might  do more harm than good, but in his pity he could not  keep silent. 'Then let  me carry it a bit  for you, Master,' he said. 'You know I would, and gladly,  as long as I have any strength. '       A wild light came  into Frodo's  eyes. 'Stand away! Don't touch me!' he  cried. 'It is mine,  I say. Be off!' His hand strayed to his sword-hilt. But  then quickly his voice changed.  'No, no,  Sam,' he said sadly.  'But you must   understand. It is my   burden,  and no  one  else can bear it. It is too late  now, Sam dear. You can't help me in that way again. I am almost in its power   now. I could not give it up, and if you tried to take it I should go mad.'       Sam  nodded. 'I understand,'  he  said.  'But  I've been thinking,  Mr.  Frodo, there's other things we might do without. Why not lighten  the load a   bit? We're going that way now, as straight as we can make it.' He pointed to   the Mountain. 'It's no good taking anything we're not sure to need.'   ####-     Frodo looked again towards the Mountain. 'No,' he said, 'we shan't need  much on that road.  And  at its  end  nothing.' Picking up his orc-shield he  flung it away and threw his helmet after it. Then pulling off the grey cloak  he undid  the  heavy  belt and let it fall to the ground,  and  the sheathed  sword with it. The shreds of the black cloak he tore off and scattered.       'There, I'll be  an orc  no more,' he  cried, 'and  I'll bear no weapon  fair or foul. Let them take me, if they will!'       Sam did likewise, and put aside his  orc-gear; and he took  out all the  things  in  his pack.  Somehow  each of them had become dear to him, if only  because he had borne them so far with so much toil. Hardest of all it was to  part with  his cooking-gear.  Tears welled in  his eyes  at  the thought  of  casting it away.       'Do you  remember that  bit  of  rabbit, Mr. Frodo?' he  said. 'And our  place under the warm bank in  Captain  Faramir's  country, the  day I saw an  oliphaunt?'       'No, I  am afraid not,  Sam, '  said Frodo. 'At  least, I know that such  things happened,  but I cannot see them. No taste of food, no feel of water,  no sound of wind,  no memory of tree or grass or flower, no image of moon or   star  are left to me. I am  naked in  the  dark.  Sam, and there is  no veil  between me  and  the wheel  of fire."
