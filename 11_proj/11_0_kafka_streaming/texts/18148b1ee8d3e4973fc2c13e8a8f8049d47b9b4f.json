And when all this land is clean  of the  servants  of Sauron, I will hold the oath fulfilled, and ye shall have peace  and depart for ever. For I am Elessar, Isildur's heir of Gondor.'       And with that he  bade Halbarad unfurl  the great standard which he had  brought; and behold! it was black, and if  there was any device upon  it, it  was hidden in the darkness. Then there was silence, and  not a whisper nor a   sigh  was heard  again all the long  night.  The  Company camped  beside the  Stone,  but  they slept little, because  of the dread  of  the Shadows  that  hedged them round.       But when the dawn came, cold and pale, Aragorn rose at once, and he led   the Company forth upon the journey of greatest haste and  weariness that any  among them  had known, save he  alone, and only his will held them to go on.  No  other mortal Men  could  have endured it, none but the  DÂ®nedain  of the  North, and with them Gimli the Dwarf and Legolas of the Elves.        They  passed Tarlang's Neck and came  into Lamedon; and the Shadow  Host  pressed behind and  fear went on  before them,  until they  came to Calembel  upon Ciril,  and the sun  went down like  blood behind Pinnath Gelin away in  the West  behind them.  The township  and  the  fords  of  Ciril  they found  deserted,  for many men had gone away to war, and all that were left fled to   the hills at the  rumour of the coming of the King of the Dead. But the next  day there  came no dawn, and the Grey Company passed on into the darkness  of  the Storm  of  Mordor and were lost  to  mortal sight; but the Dead followed  them.     ####-   Chapter 3. The Muster of Rohan            Now all roads were running together to  the  East to meet the coming of  war and the onset of the Shadow. And even as Pippin  stood at the Great Gate  of the City  and saw the Prince of Dol Amroth ride in with  his banners, the  King of Rohan came down out of the hills.       Day  was waning. In  the last  rays  of the  sun  the Riders  cast long  pointed shadows that went on before them. Darkness had already crept beneath  the murmuring fir-woods that clothed the steep mountain-sides. The king rode  now  slowly at the end  of  the day. Presently the  path turned round a huge  bare  shoulder of rock and plunged into the  gloom  of  soft -sighing  trees.   Down, down they went in a long winding file. When  at last they came  to the  bottom of  the gorge they  found that evening had fallen in the deep places.   The sun was gone. Twilight lay upon the waterfalls.       All day far below them a leaping stream had run down from the high pass  behind, cleaving its narrow way between pine-clad  walls; and now  through a   stony  gate it flowed out and passed into a wider vale. The Riders  followed  it, and suddenly Harrowdale lay before  them, loud with  the noise of waters  in the evening. There the white Snowbourn, joined by the lesser stream, went  rushing, fuming on  the  stones,  down to Edoras and the green hills and the  plains. Away to the right at the head of the great dale the mighty Starkhorn  loomed up above its  vast buttresses swathed in cloud; but  its jagged peak,  clothed in everlasting snow, gleamed far above the world, blue-shadowed upon  the East, red-stained by the sunset in the West.       Merry looked out in wonder upon this strange country,  of which he  had  heard many tales upon their long road.  It was a skyless world, in which his  eye; through dim gulfs of shadowy  air, saw only ever-mounting slopes, great  walls of  stone behind  great  walls, and  frowning precipices wreathed with  mist.  He sat  for a moment half dreaming, listening to  the noise of water,  the  whisper of dark trees, the crack of stone, and the vast waiting silence  that brooded  behind all sound. He  loved  mountains,  or he had  loved  the  thought of them marching  on the edge of  stories brought from far away;  but  now he was borne down by the insupportable weight of Middle-earth. He  longed  to shut out the immensity in a quiet room by a fire.       He was very tired, for though they had  ridden slowly, they had  ridden   ####-with very  little  rest. Hour after  hour for nearly three weary days he had  jogged  up  and down, over passes, and through long dales,  and  across many  streams. Sometimes where the way  was  broader he  had ridden at  the king's  side, not noticing that many  of the Riders smiled to see  the two together:  the  hobbit  on his little shaggy grey pony,  and the Lord of  Rohan on  his  great white horse. Then he had talked to Thjoden, telling him about his home  and the doings of  the Shire-folk, or listening in turn to tales of the Mark  and its  mighty  men of old.  But most of the time, especially  on this last  day, Merry had ridden  by himself just behind the  king, saying nothing, and  trying to understand the slow sonorous speech of Rohan that he heard the men  behind him using."
