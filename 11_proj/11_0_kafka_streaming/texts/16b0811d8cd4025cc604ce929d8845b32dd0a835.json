For on  the  eve  of  the  sudden assault a dream came to  my brother in a  troubled  sleep; and afterwards a like dream came oft to him again, and once to me.       'In that  dream I  thought the  eastern sky grew dark  and there  was a   growing thunder, but  in  the  West a pale light lingered, and out of  it  I   ####-heard a voice, remote but clear, crying:       Seek for the Sword that was broken:       In Imladris it dwells;       There shall be counsels taken       Stronger than Morgul-spells.       There shall be shown a token       That Doom is near at hand,       For Isildur's Bane shall waken,       And the Halfling forth shall stand.       Of these words we could understand little, and we  spoke to our father,  Denethor, Lord of Minas Tirith, wise in the lore of  Gondor. This only would  he say, that Imladris was  of old the name among the Elves of a far northern  dale, where Elrond the Halfelven dwelt, g reatest  of lore-masters. Therefore  my  brother, seeing how desperate  was our need, was eager to heed the dream  and seek for  Imladris; but since the  way was full  of doubt and  danger, I  took the journey upon  myself. Loth was my father to give me leave, and long  have I  wandered  by roads forgotten, seeking the house of Elrond, of  which   many had heard, but few knew where it lay.'       'And here in the house of Elrond more shall be made clear to you'  said  Aragorn,  standing up. He cast  his sword upon  the  table  that stood before  Elrond,  and  the blade  was in  two  pieces.  `Here  is  the Sword that was  Broken!' he said.       `And  who  are you, and what have  you to do with  Minas Tirith?' asked  Boromir,  looking  in  wonder  at  the  lean face  of   the  Ranger  and  his  weather-stained cloak.       `He is Aragorn  son of Arathorn,'  said Elrond;  `and  he is  descended  through many fathers from Isildur Elendil's son of  Minas  Ithil. He  is the  Chief of the D®nedain in the North, and few are now left  of that folk.'       `Then  it  belongs to  you,  and not to  me  at all!'  cried  Frodo  in  amazement, springing to his feet, as if he expected  the Ring to be demanded  at once.       'It does not belong  to either of us,'  said Aragorn; `but it has  been  ordained that you should hold it for a while.'       'Bring out the Ring, Frodo!' said Gandalf solemnly. `The time has come.  Hold it up, and then Boromir will understand the remainder of his riddle.'       There was a hush, and all turned their eyes on Frodo. He was shaken  by  a sudden shame and fear; and he felt a great reluctance to  reveal the Ring,   ####-and a loathing of its touch. He wished he was far away. The Ring gleamed and  flickered as he held it up before them in his trembling hand.       'Behold Isildur's Bane!' said Elrond.       Boromir's eyes glinted as he gazed at the golden thing. `The Halfling!'  he  muttered.  `Is then the  doom of Minas Tirith come at last? But why then  should we seek a broken sword?'       'The words were not the  doom of Minas Tir ith,' said Aragorn. `But doom  and great  deeds are indeed at hand.  For the  Sword that  was Broken is the  Sword of Elendil that broke beneath him when  he fell. It has been treasured  by  his  heirs when all other heirlooms  were lost; for it was spoken of old  among  us that it should be made  again when the  Ring, Isildur's  Bane, was  found. Now you have seen the sword that you have sought, what would you  ask?  Do you wish for the House of Elendil to return to the Land of Gondor?'       `I was  not  sent to beg  any boon, but to  seek only the meaning  of a   riddle,' answered Boromir proudly. `Yet we are hard  pressed, and  the Sword  of  Elendil would be a help beyond  our hope-if  such a  thing could  indeed  return out of  the  shadows  of  the past.' He look ed again  at Aragorn, and  doubt was in his eyes.       Frodo felt Bilbo stir impatiently at his side. Evidently he was annoyed  on his friend's behalf. Standing suddenly up he burst out:       All that is gold does not glitter,       Not all those who wander are lost;       The old that is strong does not wither,       Deep roots are not reached by the frost.         From the ashes a fire shall be woken,       A light from the shadows shall spring;       Renewed shall be blade that was broken:       The crownless again shall be king.       `Not very good perhaps, but to the point  -- if you need more beyond the  word  of Elrond. If that  was worth a journey of a hundred  and ten days  to  hear, you had best listen to it.' He sat down with a snort.       `I  made  that  up myself,' he whispered to Frodo, `for the  D®nadan, a   long  time  ago when  he first told me about  himself. I almost wish that my  adventures were not over, and that I could go with him when his day comes.'       Aragorn smiled at him; then he turned to Boromir again."
