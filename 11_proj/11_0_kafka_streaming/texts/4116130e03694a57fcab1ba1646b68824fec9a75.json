He  had proved tougher than even one of the Wise would have guessed  -as a hobbit   ####-might. There  was a little  corner of  his mind that was still  his own, and  light  came  through it, as  through  a  chink in the dark: light out of the  past.  It was actually  pleasant,  I think,  to  hear  a kindly voice again,  bringing up memories  of wind,  and trees, and sun  on the  grass, and  such  forgotten things.        'But that, of  course, would only make the evil  part of him angrier in  the end - unless it could  be conquered.  Unless it could be cured.' Gandalf  sighed. 'Alas! there is little hope of  that for him. Yet  not  no hope. No,  not  though  he  possessed  the Ring so  long, almost  as far back as he can  remember. For it was long since he  had worn it much:  in the black darkness  it was seldom needed. Certainly he had never \"faded\".  He is  thin and tough  still. But the  thing was eating up his mind, of course, and the torment had  become almost unbearable.       'All the \"great secrets\" under the mountains had turned  out to be just   empty night: there was  nothing more to find out,  nothing worth doing, only  nasty furtive eating and resentful remembering.  He was altogether wretched.  He hated the  dark,  and  he hated light more: he hated  everything, and the  Ring most of all.'       'What  do you mean?' said Frodo. 'Surely the Ring was his  precious and  the only thing he cared for?  But if he  hated it,  why didn't he get rid of  it, or go away and leave it?'       'You  ought to  begin to understand, Frodo,  after all you have heard,'  said Gandalf. 'He  hated it and loved it, as he hated and loved  himself. He  could not get rid of it. He had no will left in the matter.       'A  Ring  of  Power  looks   after  itself,  Frodo.  It  may  slip  off  treacherously, but its keeper never  abandons it. At most he  plays with the  idea of handing  it on  to someone else's care  - and  that  only at an early  stage, when it first  begins  to grip. But  as  far as I know Bilbo alone in  history has ever gone beyond playing, and  really done it.  He needed all my  help, too. And even  so he would never  have just  forsaken  it, or  cast it  aside. It  was not Gollum, Frodo, but the  Ring  itself that decided things.   The Ring left him.'       'What, just in time  to meet Bilbo?' said Frodo. 'Wouldn't an  Orc have  suited it better?'       'It  is no laughing  matter,'  said Gandalf. 'Not for you.  It was  the  strangest event in the  whole history of the  Ring so far:  Bilbo's  arrival  just at that time, and putting his hand on it, blindly, in the dark.   ####-     'There was more than one power at work, Frodo. The  Ring was  trying to  get back to its master. It had slipped from Isildur's hand and betrayed him;  then when a  chance came it caught poor Deal, and he was murdered; and after   that Gollum,  and it had devoured him. It could make  no further use of him:   he was too  small and mean; and as long as it stayed with him he would never   leave his deep pool again. So  now, when its master was awake  once more and  sending out his dark  thought from Mirkwood, it abandoned Gollum. Only to  be  picked up by the most unlikely person imaginable: Bilbo from the Shire!        'Behind that there was something else at work, beyond any design of the  Ring-maker.  I can put it no plainer than by saying that Bilbo was meant  to  find the Ring, and not by its maker.  In which  case you  also were meant to  have it. And that maybe an encouraging thought.'       It  is  not,' said Frodo. \"Though I am not sure  that I understand you.  But how have you  learned all this about the Ring, and about  Gollum? Do you   really know it all, or are you just guessing still?'       Gandalf looked  at Frodo, and his eyes glinted. I knew much  and I have  learned much,' he answered. 'But I am not  going to give an account of all my  doings to you. The history of Elendil and Isildur and the One Ring is  known   to all the  Wise. Your ring is shown to be that One Ring by the fire-writing  alone, apart from any  other evidence.' 'And  when  did you discover  that?'  asked Frodo, interrupting. 'Just  now in this room, of course,' answered the  wizard sharply.  'But  I expected to  find  it.  I have come back  from dark  journeys and long search to make that final test. It is the last proof,  and  all is now only too clear. Making out Gollum's part, and fitting it into the  gap in the history, required some  thought. I may have  started with guesses  about Gollum, but I am not guessing now. I know. I have seen him.'       'You have seen Gollum?' exclaimed Frodo in amazement.       'Yes. The obvious thing to do, of  course, if  one  could. I tried long  ago; but I have managed it at last.'       'Then what happened after Bilbo escaped from him? Do you know that?'       'Not so  clearly.  What I  have told you is what Gollum was  willing to  tell - though not, of course, in the  way  I have  reported it."
