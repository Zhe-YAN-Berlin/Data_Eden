'What  is that?' said Gandalf, opening his  eyes. 'Yes,  I think I  can  guess  what her  words  may  mean.  Your pardon,  Gimli! I was pondering the   ####-messages once again. But indeed she sent words to you, and  neither dark nor  sad.       '  \"To  Gimli son  of  Gluin,\" she  said,  \"give  his   Lady's greeting.  Lock -bearer, wherever thou goest  my thought goes with thee. But have a care  to lay thine axe to the right tree!\" '       'In  happy hour  you  have returned to  us, Gandalf,'  cried the Dwarf,   capering  as  he sang  loudly in the  strange dwarf-tongue. 'Come, come!' he  shouted, swinging his axe. 'Since Gandalf's head is now sacred, let us  find   one that it is right to cleave!'       'That  will  not  be far to seek,' said  Gandalf, rising from his seat.  'Come!  We have  spent all  the time that is allowed to a meeting  of parted  friends. Now there is need of haste.'       He wrapped himself again  in his old  tattered cloak, and led the  way.  Following  him they descended quickly from the high shelf and made their way  back through the forest, down the bank  of the Entwash. They  spoke no  more  words,  until they stood again upon the grass  beyond the eaves of  Fangorn.   There was no sign of their horses to be seen.       'They have not returned,' said Legolas. 'It will be a weary walk!'       'I shall not  walk. Time presses,' said  Gandalf.  Then lifting up  his  head he gave  a long whistle. So clear and  piercing was  the  note that the  others  stood  amazed to hear such a sound come from those old bearded lips.  Three times he whistled; and then  faint and far off it seemed to  them that  they heard the whinny  of a horse borne up from the plains upon the  eastern  wind.  They waited wondering. Before long there came  the sound of hoofs, at  first hardly more than a tremor of the ground perceptible only to Aragorn as  he lay upon the  grass, then  growing steadily louder and clearer to a quick   beat.       'There is more than one horse coming,' said Aragorn.       'Certainly,' said Gandalf. 'We are too great a burden for one.'       'There are three,'  sa id Legolas, gazing out  over the plain.  'See how  they run!  There is Hasufel, and  there is my  friend Arod  beside  him! But  there is another that strides ahead: a very great horse. I have not seen his  like before.'       'Nor will you again,' said Gandalf. 'That is Shadowfax. He is the chief  of the  Mearas, lords  of horses, and not even Thjoden, King  of  Rohan, has  ever looked on  a better. Does he not shine like silver, and run as smoothly  as a swift stream? He has come for me: the horse of the White  Rider. We are   ####-going to battle together.'       Even  as the old wizard  spoke,  the great horse  came striding up  the  slope towards them; his coat was glistening and his mane flowing in the wind  of his speed. The two others followed, now  far behind. As soon as Shadowfax  saw Gandalf, he checked his  pace and  whinnied loudly; then trotting gently   forward he stooped his proud head and nuzzled his great nostrils against the  old man's neck.       Gandalf caressed him. 'It is a  long way from Rivendell, my friend,' he  said;  'but you are wise and swift and  come at need.  Far let us  ride  now  together, and part not in this world again!'       Soon  the other horses  came up  and stood quietly  by, as if  awaiting  orders. 'We go at once to Meduseld, the  hall of your master, Thjoden,' said  Gandalf, addressing them gravely. They bowed their heads.  'Time presses, so  with your leave, my friends, we  will ride. We beg you to use  all the speed  that  you can. Hasufel shall bear Aragorn and Arod Legolas. I will set Gimli   before me, and by  his leave  Shadowfax shall bear us both. We will wait now  only to drink a little.'       'Now I understand a part of last night's  riddle,' said Legolas  as  he  sprang lightly  upon Arod's back.  'Whether they  fled  at first in fear, or  not,  our horses met  Shadowfax, their chieftain, and greeted him with  joy.  Did you know that he was at hand, Gandalf?'       'Yes, I knew,'  said the wizard.  'I bent  my thought upon him, bidding  him to  make haste; for yesterday he was far away in the south of this land.  Swiftly may he bear me back again!'       Gandalf spoke  now to Shadowfax, and  the horse set off at a good pace,  yet  not  beyond the measure of the  others. After a little while  he turned  suddenly, and  choosing  a place where the ba nks  were  lower, he waded  the  river, and then led them away due south into a flat land, treeless and wide.  The wind went like grey waves through the endless miles of  grass. There was  no sign of road or track, but Shadowfax did not stay or falter.       'He is  steering a straight course now for  the halls of Thjoden  under   the slopes of the White  Mountains,' said  Gandalf."
