A  green ride  lay almost unseen  through the  thickets on the right; and this they  followed as it wound away  back up the  wooded slopes on to the  top of a shoulder of  the  hills  that  stood out into the lower land of the river -valley. Suddenly they came out of  the shadow of  the trees, and  before them lay a  wide space of  grass, grey  under the night. On three sides the woods  pressed upon it; but eastward the  ground fell steeply and the tops of the dark trees, growing at the bottom of  the slope,  were  below their feet. Beyond, the  low lands  lay dim and flat  under the stars.  Nearer  at hand  a few lights twinkled  in the village  of  Woodhall.       The  Elves sat on  the grass  and spoke  together in  soft voices; they  seemed to take no further  notice of the hobbits.  Frodo and his  companions  wrapped themselves in cloaks and blankets, and drowsiness stole  over  them.  The  night grew  on,  and  the  lights in the valley  went out. Pippin  fell  asleep, pillowed on a green hillock.       Away  high  in the East swung Remmirath,  the Netted Stars,  and slowly  above  the mists red Borgil rose, glowing like a jewel of fire. Then by some  shift of airs all the mist was drawn away like a veil, and there leaned  up,  as  he  climbed  over  the  rim  of the  world, the  Swordsman  of  the  Sky,  Menelvagor with  his shining  belt. The  Elves all burst into song. Suddenly  under the trees a fire sprang up with a red light.       'Come!' the  Elves called to the hobbits. 'Come!  Now is  the time  for  speech and merriment!'       Pippin sat up and rubbed his eyes. He shivered. 'There is a fire in the  hall, and food for hungry guests,' said an Elf standing before him.       At the south  end of the greensward  there  was an opening.  There  the  green  floor  ran on into the wood, and formed a  wide  space like  a  hall,  roofed by the boughs of trees. Their great trunks ran like pillars down each  side. In the middle there was a wood-fire blazing, and upon the tree-pillars  torches with lights of gold and silver were burning  steadily. The Elves sat  round the  fire upon the grass or  upon the  sawn  rings of old trunks. Some  went  to  and  fro bearing cups and  pouring  drink; others brought  food on  heaped plates and dishes.        'This  is poor fare,' they said  to the hobbits; 'for we are lodging in   ####-the greenwood far from  our halls. If ever  you are our guests at  home,  we  will treat you better.'       'It seems to me good enough for a birthday-party,' said Frodo.       Pippin afterwards recalled little o f either food or drink, for his mind  was  filled  with the  light upon the elf-faces, and the  sound of voices so  various and so beautiful that he felt in a waking  dream.  But he remembered   that there was bread, surpassing the savour of a fair white  loaf to one who  is starving;  and fruits  sweet  as  wildberries  and richer than the tended  fruits of gardens; he drained a cup that was filled with a fragrant draught,  cool as a clear fountain, golden as a summer afternoon.       Sam could never describe in words, nor picture clearly to himself, what  he felt or thought that  night, though it remained in  his  memory as one of  the chief  events of his life.  The  nearest he  ever got was to say: 'Well,  sir, if I could grow  apples like that, I would call  myself a gardener. But  it was the singing that went to my heart, if you know what I mean.'       Frodo sat, eating, drinking, and talking with delight; but his mind was  chiefly on the words spoken. He knew a little of the elf-speech and listened  eagerly. Now and again he spoke to those that served him and thanked them in  their own language. They smiled at  him  and said laughing: 'Here is a jewel  among hobbits!'       After a while Pippin fell fast asleep, and was lifted up and borne away  to a bower under the trees; there he was laid upon a soft bed and  slept the  rest  of the night away. Sam refused to  leave  his  master. When Pippin had  gone, he came and sat curled up at Frodo's feet, where at last he nodded and  closed his eyes. Frodo remained long awake, talking with Gildor.       They  spoke of many things, old  and new,  and Frodo questioned  Gildor   much about happenings  in the wide world outside the Shire. The tidings were  mostly  sad and ominous: of  gathering  darkness, the wars  of Men,  and the  flight of the Elves. At last Frodo asked  the question  that  was nearest to  his heart:       'Tell me, Gildor, have you ever seen Bilbo since he left us?'       Gildor  smiled.  'Yes,' he answered.  'Twice. He said farewell to us on  this very  spot. But I saw  him once again, far  from here.' He would say no  more about Bilbo, and Frodo fell silent.       'You do not ask me or tell me much that concerns yourself, Frodo,' said  Gildor. 'But I already know a little, and I  can read more in your  face and  in the thought behind your questions. You are leaving the Shire, and yet you    ####-doubt that you will find  what you seek, or accomplish what  you intend,  or   that you will ever return."
