And they  must be hardy men that go willingly, knowing their peril.'       'All are weary,  and very  many have  wounds  light  or grievous,' said  Jomer,  'and  we have suffered  much loss of our horses, and that  is ill to  bear. If we must ride soon, then I cannot  hope to  lead even two thousands,  and yet leave as ma ny for the defence of the City.'       'We have not only to reckon with those who fought  on this field ' said  Aragorn.  'New strength is on the way from the southern fiefs, now  that the  coasts have been  rid. Four thousands I sent marching from Pelargir  through   Lossarnach two days  ago; and  Angbor the fearless rides  before them. If we  set out in two days  more,  they will draw nigh ere we depart. Moreover many  were bidden to  follow me up the River  in  any craft they could gather; and  with this wind they  will soon be at hand, indeed several ships have already  come to the Harlond. I judge that we could lead out seven thousands of horse  and foot, and yet  leave the City  in better defence  than it  was  when the  assault began.'       'The Gate  is destroyed,' said Imrahil, 'and where now is the skill  to  rebuild it and set it up anew?'       'In Erebor  in  the Kingdom of Dbin there is such skill,' said Aragorn;  'and  if all our hopes do not perish, then in time I will send Gimli Gluin's  son to ask for wrights of  the Mountain. But  men are better than gates, and  no gate will endure against our Enemy if men desert it.'       This then was the end of the debate  of the lords: that they should set  forth on the  second  morning from that day with  seven thousands, if  these  might  be found; and the great part of this force should be on foot, because  of the  evil lands  into which they would go. Aragorn  should  find some two  thousands  of those that he  had  gathered to him  in the South; but Imrahil  should find  three  and  a half thousands;  and Jomer  five  hundreds  of the  Rohirrim who  were unhorsed but themselves warworthy, and he himself   should  lead five hundreds of his  best Riders on horse; and another company of five  hundred horse there  should be,  among which should ride the sons  of Elrond  with  the D®nedain and the knights of Dol Amroth: all told six thousand foot  and a thousand horse. But the main strength  of the  Rohirrim  that remained  horsed and able to  fight, some three thousand under the command of Elfhelm,  should waylay the West Road against  the enemy that was in  Anurien. And  at   ####-once swift riders were sent out to gather  what news they could  northwards;   and eastwards from Osgiliath and the road to Minas Morgul.       And when they  had reck oned up all their strength and taken thought for   the  journeys  they should  make  and the  roads they should choose, Imrahil   suddenly laughed aloud.       'Surely,' he cried, 'this is  the greatest jest  in  all the history of  Gondor:  that  we should  ride with seven thousands,  scarce  as many as the  vanguard of its army in  the days of its power, to assail the mountains  and  the impenetrable  gate  of the  Black Land!  So  might  a  child  threaten a   mail-clad knight with a bow of string and green  willow! If  the  Dark  Lord  knows so  much as you say, Mithrandir,  will  he not rather smile than fear,  and with his little finger crush us like a fly that tries to sting him?'       'No, he  will try to  trap  the fly  and take the sting,' said Gandalf.  'And there are names among us that are worth more than a thousand  mail -clad  knights apiece. No, he will not smile.'       'Neither  shall  we,'  said Aragorn. 'If this be  jest, then it is  too  bitter for laughter.  Nay, it is the last  move in a great jeopardy, and for  one  side or  the other  it  will bring the end of the game.' Then  he  drew  And®ril and  held it up glittering  in the sun. 'You shall  not  be sheathed  again until the last battle is fought;' he said.     ####-   Chapter 10. The Black Gate Opens            Two days later the army of the West was all assembled on the  Pelennor.   The host of Orcs and Easterlings had turned back out of Anurien, but harried  and scattered by the Rohirrim they had  broken and fled with little fighting  towards Cair  Andros;  and with  that  threat  destroyed  and  new  strength  arriving out of the South the City  was as well  manned  as might be. Scouts  reported  that  no  enemies remained  upon the  roads  east  as  far  as the  Cross-roads of the Fallen King. All now was ready for the last throw.        Legolas and Gimli were to ride again together in the company of Aragorn  and Gandalf, who went in the  van with the D®nedain  and the sons of Elrond.  But Merry to his shame was not to go with them.       'You are  not fit for  such a  journey,' said  Aragorn. 'But  do not be  ashamed.  If  you do no  more  in  this  war, you have already earned  great  honour."
