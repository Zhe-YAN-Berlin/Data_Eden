We've been a bit free with it  so far.'       `I  don't know how long we shall take to -- to finish,' said Frodo. `We  were miserably delayed  in the hills. But Samwise Gamgee,  my dear hobbit  --  indeed, Sam my dearest  hobbit, friend of friends  --  I do not think we need  give thought  to what comes after that. To  do the job as you put it  -- what  hope is  there that we ever shall? And if we do, who knows what will come of  that? If the One goes into the Fire, and we are at hand? I ask you, Sam, are  we ever likely to need bread again? I think not. If  we can nurse  our limbs  to bring  us to Mount Doom, that is  all we can do. More than I can, I begin  to feel.'       Sam nodded silently. He took his master's hand and bent over it. He did  not kiss it,  though his  tears fell on it. Then  he turned away,  drew  his  sleeve  over his nose, and got up, a nd stamped about, trying to whistle, and  saying between the efforts: 'Where's that dratted creature?'   ####-     It was actually not long before Gollum returned; but he came so quietly  that they did not hear him till  he stood before them. His  fingers and face  were soiled with black mud. He was still chewing  and slavering. What he was  chewing, they did not ask or like to think.       'Worms  or beetles or something slimy out of holes,' thought Sam. 'Brr!  The nasty creature; the poor wretch! '       Gollum  said  nothing to  them,  until he had  drunk deeply  and washed  himself in the  stream. Then he  came up to them, licking  his lips. 'Better  now,' he said. `Are we  rested? Ready to  go  on? Nice  hobbits,  they sleep  beautifully. Trust Smjagol now? Very, very good.'       The next stage of their journey was much the same as the  last. As they  went  on the gully became ever shallower and  the slope  of its  floor  more  gradual. Its  bottom  was less stony and  more earthy, and slowly its  sides  dwindled to mere ba nks. It began  to wind and wander. That night drew to its  end, but clouds were now over moon and star, and they  knew of the coming of  day only by the slow spreading of the thin grey light.       In  a chill hour they came  to the end of  the water-course. The  banks  became moss-grown mounds. Over the  last shelf of rotting  stone the  stream  gurgled  and fell  down into a brown bog and was lost. Dry  reeds hissed and   rattled though they could feel no wind.       On either  side and in front wide  fens and  m ires now lay,  stretching  away southward and eastward into the dim half-light. Mists curled and smoked  from dark and noisome pools. The reek of  them hung  stifling  in the  still  air.  Far away, now almost  due  south, the mountain-walls of Mordor loomed,  like a black bar of rugged clouds floating above a dangerous fog-bound sea.       The hobbits were now wholly in the hands of  Gollum. They did now know,   and  could not guess in that misty light. that they  were in  fact only just   within the northern  borders of the marshes. the  main expanse of  which lay  south of them. They could, if they had known the lands, with some delay have  retraced their steps  a little, and then turning east have come  round  over   hard roads  to the bare plain of Dagorlad: the field of  the  ancient battle  before  the gates of Mordor. Not that there was great hope in such a course.  On that stony  plain  there was no cover,  and across it ran the highways of  the Orcs and the soldiers of the Enemy. Not even the cloaks of  Lurien would  have concealed them there.       'How do we shape our course now, Smjagol? ' asked Frodo. 'Must we cross  these evil-smelling fens?  '   ####-     `No need,  no  need at all,' said Gollum. 'Not if hobbits want to reach  the dark mountains and go to see Him very quick.  Back a little, and round a   little' -- his skinny arm waved north and  east -- `and you can come on hard  cold roads to the  very gates of  His country.  Lots  of  His people will be  there looking out for guests, very pleased to  take them straight  to Him, O  yes. His Eye watches  that way all the  time. It caught  Smjagol there, long  ago.' Gollum shuddered. 'But Smjagol has used his eyes since then, yes, yes:   I've used  eyes  and feet  and  nose since then. l  know  other  ways.  More  difficult, not so quick; but  better, if  we  don't want  Him to see. Follow  Smjagol! He can take you through  the marshes, through the mists. nice thick  mists. Follow  Smjagol very carefully, and you  may go  a long  way. quite a   long way, before He catches you, yes perhaps. '       It was already day, a windless and sullen morning, and the  marsh-reeks  lay in heavy banks. No sun pierced the low  clouded  sky, and Gollum  seemed  anxious to continue the journey at once. So after a brief  rest they set out  again and were soon lost in a shadowy silent world, cut off from all view of  the lands about, either the hills  that they  had left or the mountains that  they sought."
