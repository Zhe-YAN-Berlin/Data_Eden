You   were shut up for hours.'       \"Talking,' said Bilbo. `There was a deal  of  talk, and everyone had an  eye-opener. Even old Gandalf.  I think  Legolas's  bit  of news  about Gollum  caught even him on the hop, though he passed it off.'       `You were wrong,'  said Gandalf. 'You  were  inattentive. I had already  heard of it from Gwaihir. If you want to know, the only real eye-openers, as  you put  it,  were you  and Frodo;  and  I was  the  only  one  that was not  surprised.'       `Well,  anyway,'  said Bilbo, 'nothing was decided beyond choosing poor   Frodo  and Sam. I was  afraid all  the time that it might come to that, if I  was let off. But if you ask me, Elrond will send out a fair number, when the  reports come in. Have they started yet, Gandalf?'       'Yes,' said the wizard. `Some of the scouts have been sent out already.   ####-More will go  tomorrow.  Elrond is sending Elves, and they will get in touch  with the Rangers, and maybe  with  Thranduil's folk in Mirkwood. And  Aragorn  has gone with Elrond's  sons. We shall have to scour the lands all round for   many long  leagues before any  move is  made. So cheer  up, Frodo! You  will  probably make quite a long stay here.'       'Ah!' said  Sam gloomily.  'We'll  just wait long enough for  winter to  come.'       'That can't be  helped,' said Bilbo.  'It's your fault partly, Frodo my  lad: insisting on waiting  for my  birthday. A  funny way of honouring it, I  can't help thinking. Not the day I should have chosen for letting the S.-B .s  into Bag End. But there it is: you can't wait now fill spring; and you can't   go till the reports come back.       When winter first begins to bite        and stones crack in the frosty night,       when pools are black and trees are bare,       'tis evil in the Wild to fare.       But that I am afraid will be just your luck.'       'I am  afraid  it  will,' said Gandalf. 'We  can't start until  we have  found out about the Riders.'       `I thought they were all destroyed in the flood,' said Merry.       'You cannot destroy Ringwraiths like that,' said Gandalf. `The power of  their master  is in them, and  they stand or fall by  him. We hope that they  were all unhorsed and unmasked, and so made  for a while less dangerous;  but  we must find out for certain. In the meantime you should try and forget your   troubles, Frodo. I do not know if I can do anything to  help you; but I will  whisper this in your ears. Someone said that intelligence would be needed in   the party. He was right. I think I shall come with you.'       So great was Frodo's delight at this announcement that Gandalf left the  window-sill, where he  had been sitting, and took off his hat and  bowed. 'I   only said I think I shall come. Do not count on anything yet. In this matter   Elrond will have much to say, and your friend the Strider. Which reminds me,  I want to see Elrond. I must be off.'       `How long  do you  think I  shall have here?' said  Frodo to Bilbo when  Gandalf had gone.       `Oh,  I don't know. I can't count  days in Rivendell,' said Bilbo. 'But  quite long, I should think. We can have many a good talk. What about helping   ####-me with my book, and making a  start  on the next?  Have you  thought of  an  ending?'       'Yes, several, a nd all are dark and unpleasant,' said Frodo.       'Oh, that won't do!' said Bilbo. `Books ought to have good endings. How  would this do:  and they all  settled  down and  lived together happily ever  after?'       `It will do well, if it ever comes to that,' said Frodo.       'Ah!' said Sam. 'And where will they live? That's what I often wonder.'       For a while the hobbits continued to talk and think of the past journey  and of the perils  that  lay ahead; but such  was the  virtue of the land of  Rivendell that soon all  fear  and anxiety was lifted  from their minds. The  future, good or  ill, was not forgotten, but ceased to have  any  power over   the present. Health and hope grew strong in them, and they were content with  each good day as it came, taking plea sure in every  meal,  and in every word  and song.       So the days slipped away, as  each morning dawned  bright and fair, and  each evening followed cool and clear. But autumn was waning fast; slowly the  golden light  faded to pale silver, and the  lingering leaves fell  from the  naked trees. A wind began to  blow  chill  from  the  Misty Mountains to the  east. The Hunter's Moon waxed round in the  night sky, and put to flight all  the  lesser stars. But low  in the South one star shone red. Every night, as  the  Moon  waned  again,  it shone brighter and brighter. Frodo could see it  from his window, deep in the heavens burning like a watchful eye that glared  above the trees on the brink of the valley.       The hobbits had been nearly  two  months  in the House  of  Elrond, and  November  had  gone by  with the  last  shreds  of autumn, and  December was  passing, when the scouts  began to  return."
