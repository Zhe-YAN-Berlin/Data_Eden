'The Dead Marshes,  yes, yes: that is their names,'  he  cackled. `You should not look in when the candles are lit.'       `Who are they? What are they? ' asked Sam shuddering, turning to Frodo,  who was now behind him.       'I don't know,' said Frodo in a dreamlike voice. 'But I have seen  them  too. In the pools when the candles were lit. They lie in all the pools, pale  faces, deep deep under the dark water. I saw  them: grim faces and evil, and  noble faces and sad. Many faces  proud and fair, and weeds  in their  silver   hair.  But all foul, all rotting, all  dead. A fell light is in them.' Frodo  hid  his eyes in his hands.  'I  know not who they are; but I thought I  saw  there Men and Elves, and Orcs beside them.'       `Yes, yes,' said Gollum. `All dead, all rotten. Elves and Men and Orcs.   The  Dead  Marshes. There was a great battle long ago, yes, so they told him  when Smjagol was young, when I was young  before the Precious came. It was  a  great  battle. Tall  Men with long swords, and terrible  Elves,  and  Orcses  shrieking. They fought on  the plain for days and months at the Black Gates.   But  the  Marshes have grown since  then,  swallowed up the  graves;  always  creeping, creeping.'   ####-     'But that is an age and more ago,'  said Sam. 'The Dead can't be really  there! Is it some devilry hatched in the Dark Land? '       `Who knows?  Smjagol doesn't  know,'  answered Gollum. 'You cannot reach  them,  you  cannot touch them. We tried once, .yes,  precious. I tried once;  but you cannot reach them. Only  shapes  to see, perhaps, not  to  touch. No  precious! All dead.'       Sam  looked darkly at him and shuddered again, thinking that he guessed  why Smjagol  had tried to touch them. `Well, I don't  want to  see them,' he  said. 'Never again! Can't we get on and get away? '       `Yes,  yes,' said  Gollum. `But slowly, very slowly. Very carefully! Or  hobbits go  down to  join the Dead  ones  and light  little  candles. Follow  Smjagol! Don't look at lights! '       He  crawled away to the  right, seeking for a path round the mere. They   came close behind, stooping, often using their hands even as he  did. 'Three  precious  little Gollums in a row we shall be, if this goes on much longer,'  thought Sam.       At last they came to the  end of the black  mere, and  they crossed it,  perilously,  crawling  or hopping  from  one  treacherous island tussock  to  another. Often they floundered, stepping or  falling hands-first into waters  as  noisome as a cesspool,  till  they were slimed and  fouled almost  up to  their necks and stank in one another's nostrils.       It was late  in the night  when at  length  they reached  firmer ground  again.  Gollum hissed  and whispered to himself, but it appeared that he was  pleased: in some mysterious way,  by some blended  sense of feel, and smell,  and uncanny memory for shapes  in  the dark, he seemed to know just where he  was again, and to be sure of his road ahead.       `Now on we  go!  ' he  said.  'Nice  hobbits! Brave  hobbits! Very very  weary, of course; so we are, my precious, all of us. But we must take master   away from the wicked lights, yes, yes, we must.' With these words he started  off again, almost  at a trot,  down what  appeared to be a long lane between  high reeds, and they  stumbled after him  as quickly as they could. But in a   little while he stopped suddenly and sniffed the  air doubtfully, hissing as  if he was troubled or displeased again.       'What is it? ' growled Sam, misinterpreting the signs. `What's the need  to  sniff? The stink nearly knocks me down with my nose held. You stink, and  master stinks; the whole place stinks.'       'Yes, yes, and Sam stinks! ' answered Gollum. `Poor Smjagol  smells it,   ####-but good  Smjagol bears  it. Helps nice master. But  that's no  matter.  The  air's moving, change is coming. Smjagol wonders; he's not happy.'       He went on again, but his uneasiness grew, and  every  now and again he  stood  up to his full height, craning his neck eastward and  southward.  For  some  time the hobbits could not  hear  or feel what was troubling him. Then  suddenly all  three  halted, stiffening and listening. To Frodo  and  Sam it  seemed that  they  heard, far away, a  long  wailing cry, high and  thin and  cruel.  They shivered. At  the same  moment the stirring  of the  air became  perceptible to them; and it grew  very cold. As they  stood  straining their  ears,  they heard a noise  like a  wind coming  in  the distance.  The misty  lights wavered, dimmed, and went out.       Gollum would not move. He stood shaking and gibbering to himself, until  with a rush the wind came upon  them, hissing and snarling over the marshes.   The  night became less  dark,  light enough  for them to  see, or  half see,  shapeless drifts of fog,  curling and  twisting  as it rolled over them  and  passed them."
