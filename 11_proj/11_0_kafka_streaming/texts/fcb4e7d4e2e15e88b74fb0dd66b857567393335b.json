'What have I said? ' he cried. `What have I done? Frodo, Frodo! ' he called.   'Come back! A madness took me, but it has passed. Come back! '       There was no answer. Frodo did not even hear his cries. He was  already  far  away, leaping  blindly up  the path to the hill -top. Terror  and  grief  shook  him, seeing in  his thought the  mad fierce face of Boromir,  and his  burning eyes.       Soon  he came out alone on the summit of Amon Hen, and halted,  gasping  for breath. He saw as through a mist a  wide  flat circle, paved with mighty  flags, and surrounded with  a crumbling battlement;  and in the middle,  set  upon four carven pillars, was a high seat, reached by a stair of many steps.  Up  he went and sat upon the ancient chair, feeling like  a lost  child that  had clambered upon the throne of mountain-kings.        At first he could see little. He seemed  to be in a  world of  mist  in  which  there were only shadows: the Ring  was upon him.  Then here and there  the mist gave way and he saw  many visions: small and clear as if they  were   ####-under his eyes upon a table, and yet remote. There was no sound, only bright  living images.  The world  seemed to have shrunk  and  fallen silent. He was  sitting upon the Seat of Seeing, on Amon Hen, the Hill of the Eye of the Men  of  NÂ®menor. Eastward he looked into  wide uncharted lands, nameless plains,   and forests unexplored. Northward he looked, and the Great  River lay like a  ribbon beneath him, and the  Misty Mountains stood small and hard  as broken  teeth. Westward he looked and saw  the broad pastures of Rohan; and Orthanc,  the pinnacle of Isengard, like a black spike. Southward he looked, and below  his very feet the  Great River curled  like a toppling wave and plunged over  the falls of Rauros into a foaming pit; a glimmering rainbow played upon the  fume. And Ethir Anduin he saw, the mighty delta of the River, and myriads of  sea -birds whirling like a white dust  in the  sun, and  beneath them a green  and silver sea, rippling in endless lines.        But everywhere he looked he saw  the signs of  war. The Misty Mountains  were  crawling  like anthills:  orcs were  issuing out  of a thousand holes.   Under the  boughs of  Mirkwood there was  deadly strife of Elves and Men and  fell  beasts. The  land of the Beornings was aflame; a cloud was over Moria;  smoke rose on the borders of Lurien.       Horsemen  were  galloping on  the grass of  Rohan;  wolves poured  from   Isengard. From the  havens of Harad ships of war  put out to sea; and out of  the East Men were moving endlessly: swordsmen, spearmen, bowmen upon  horses,  chariots of chieftains  and laden wains. All  the power of the Dark Lord was  in  motion. Then turning south  again  he  beheld Minas Tirith. Far away  it  seemed. and beautiful: white-walled,  many-towered, proud  and fair upon its  mountain-seat;  its battlements  glittered with  steel, and its turrets were  bright with many banners. Hope leaped in his heart. But against Minas Tirith  was  set  another  fortress,  greater and more  strong.  Thither,  eastward,  unwilling his eye was drawn.  It passed the ruined bridges of Osgiliath, the  grinning  gates of  Minas Morgul. and the  haunted Mountains, and it  looked  upon Gorgoroth,  the  valley of terror  in the  Land  of Mordor. Darkness lay  there under the Sun. Fire glowed amid the smoke. Mount Doom was burning,  and  a  great  reek  rising.  Then at last  his  gaze was held: wall  upon  wall,  battlement  upon  battlement, black, immeasurably strong,  mountain of iron,  gate of steel, tower of adamant, he saw  it: Barad-dyr,  Fortress of Sauron.  All hope left him.   ####-     And suddenly he felt the  Eye. There was an eye  in the Dark Tower that  did not sleep. He knew that it had become aware of his gaze.  A fierce eager   will  was there.  It leaped  towards him; almost  like a finger he  felt it,  searching for him. Very soon it would nail him down, know just exactly where  he was. Amon  Lhaw it touched. It glanced  upon Tol Brandir he threw himself  from the seat, crouching, covering his head with his grey hood.       He heard himself crying out: Never, never! Or was it: Verily I  come, I  come to  you? He could not tell. Then  as a flash  from some other point  of  power there  came  to  his mind another thought: Take it off!  Take  it off!  Fool, take it off! Take off the Ring!       The two powers strove in him. For a moment,  perfectly balanced between  their piercing  points,  he  writhed,  tormented. Suddenly  he was aware  of  himself  again. Frodo, neither  the  Voice nor the Eye: free to choose,  and  with  one  remaining  instant in  which to  do so. He  took the Ring off his  finger. He  was kneeling in clear  sunlight before  the  high  seat. A black   shadow seemed to  pass like an arm above him; it  missed Amon Hen and  groped  out west,  and faded."
