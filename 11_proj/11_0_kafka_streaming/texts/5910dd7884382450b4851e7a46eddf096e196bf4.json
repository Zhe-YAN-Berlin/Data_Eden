The man he brought with him wore a cloak of green and yellow feathers and had skin as black as polished jet.  Your Grace,  the knight said,  I bring you Quhuru Mo, captain of the Cinnamon Wind out of Tall Trees Town.   The black man knelt.  I am greatly honored, my queen,  he said; not in the tongue of the Summer Isles, which Dany did not know, but in the liquid Valyrian of the Nine Free Cities.   The honor is mine, Quhuru Mo,  said Dany in the same language.  Have you come from the Summer Isles?    This is so, Your Grace, but before, not half a year past, we called at Oldtown. From there I bring you a wondrous gift.    A gift?    A gift of news. Dragonmother, Stormborn, I tell you true, Robert Baratheon is dead.   Outside her walls, dusk was settling over Qarth, but a sun had risen in Dany’s heart.  Dead?  she repeated. In her lap, black Drogon hissed, and pale smoke rose before her face like a veil.  You are certain? The Usurper is dead?    So it is said in Oldtown, and Dorne, and Lys, and all the other ports where we have called.   He sent me poisoned wine, yet I live and he is gone.  What was the manner of his death?  On her shoulder, pale Viserion flapped wings the color of cream, stirring the air.   Torn by a monstrous boar whilst hunting in his kingswood, or so I heard in Oldtown. Others say his queen betrayed him, or his brother, or Lord Stark who was his Hand. Yet all the tales agree in this: King Robert is dead and in his grave.   Dany had never looked upon the Usurper’s face, yet seldom a day had passed when she had not thought of him. His great shadow had lain across her since the hour of her birth, when she came forth amidst blood and storm into a world where she no longer had a place. And now this ebony stranger had lifted that shadow.   The boy sits the Iron Throne now,  Ser Jorah said.   King Joffrey reigns,  Quhuru Mo agreed,  but the Lannisters rule. Robert’s brothers have fled King’s Landing. The talk is, they mean to claim the crown. And the Hand has fallen, Lord Stark who was King Robert’s friend. He has been seized for treason.    Ned Stark a traitor?  Ser Jorah snorted.  Not bloody likely. The Long Summer will come again before that one would besmirch his precious honor.    What honor could he have?  Dany said.  He was a traitor to his true king, as were these Lannisters.  It pleased her to hear that the Usurper’s dogs were fighting amongst themselves, though she was unsurprised. The same thing happened when her Drogo died, and his great khalasar tore itself to pieces.  My brother is dead as well, Viserys who was the true king,  she told the Summer Islander.  Khal Drogo my lord husband killed him with a crown of molten gold.  Would her brother have been any wiser, had he known that the vengeance he had prayed for was so close at hand?   Then I grieve for you, Dragonmother, and for bleeding Westeros, bereft of its rightful king.   Beneath Dany’s gentle fingers, green Rhaegal stared at the stranger with eyes of molten gold. When his mouth opened, his teeth gleamed like black needles.  When does your ship return to Westeros, Captain?    Not for a year or more, I fear. From here the Cinnamon Wind sails east, to make the trader’s circle round the Jade Sea.    I see,  said Dany, disappointed.  I wish you fair winds and good trading, then. You have brought me a precious gift.    I have been amply repaid, great queen.   She puzzled at that.  How so?   His eyes gleamed.  I have seen dragons.   Dany laughed.  And will see more of them one day, I hope. Come to me in King’s Landing when I am on my father’s throne, and you shall have a great reward.   The Summer Islander promised he would do so, and kissed her lightly on the fingers as he took his leave. Jhiqui showed him out, while Ser Jorah Mormont remained.   Khaleesi,  the knight said when they were alone,  I should not speak so freely of your plans, if I were you. This man will spread the tale wherever he goes now.    Let him,  she said.  Let the whole world know my purpose. The Usurper is dead, what does it matter?    Not every sailor’s tale is true,  Ser Jorah cautioned,  and even if Robert be truly dead, his son rules in his place. This changes nothing, truly.    This changes everything.  Dany rose abruptly. Screeching, her dragons uncoiled and spread their wings. Drogon flapped and clawed up to the lintel over the archway. The others skittered across the floor, wingtips scrabbling on the marble.  Before, the Seven Kingdoms were like my Drogo’s khalasar, a hundred thousand made as one by his strength. Now they fly to pieces, even as the khalasar did after my khal lay dead.    The high lords have always fought. Tell me who’s won and I’ll tell you what it means. Khaleesi, the Seven Kingdoms are not going to fall into your hands like so many ripe peaches. You will need a fleet, gold, armies, alliances—    All this I know."
