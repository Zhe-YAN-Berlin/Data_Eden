Most  likely it seems that if  he  were here now the choice would still wait on you. Such is your fate.'       Frodo did not answer at once. Then he spoke slowly. `I  know that haste  is needed, yet I cannot choose. The burden is heavy. Give me an hour longer,  and I will speak. Let me be alone! '       Aragorn looked  at  him with  kindly  pity. `Very  well,  Frodo  son of  Drogo,' he  said. `You shall have an hour, and  you  shall be alone. We will  stay here for a while. But do not stray far or out of call.'       Frodo sat for a moment with his head bowed. Sam, who had  been watching  his master with  great  concern, shook his  head and  muttered:  'Plain as a   pikestaff it is, but it's no good Sam Gamgee putting in his spoke just now.'  ,       Presently Frodo  got  up and  walked away;  and Sam saw that  while the   others restrained  themselves and did not stare at him,  the eyes of Boromir  followed Frodo  intently, until he passed  out of sight in the  trees at the  foot of Amon Hen.       Wandering  aimlessly at first in the  wood, Frodo found  that his  feet   ####-were leading  him up towards the  slopes of the hill. He came to a path, the  dwindling ruins of a  road of long  ago. In steep places stairs of stone had  been hewn,  but now they were  cracked  and worn, and split by the  roots of  trees.  For some while he climbed, not caring which  way  he  went, until he  came  to a  grassy place. Rowan-trees grew about it, and  in the midst was a   wide  flat stone.  The  little upland lawn  was  open upon the  East and was  filled now with  the early  sunlight. Frodo halted  and looked  out over the  River, far  below  him, to Tol  Brandir and the birds wheeling in the  great  gulf of air between  him and the untrodden isle.  The voice of Rauros was  a   mighty roaring mingled with a deep throbbing boom.       He  sat  down upon the stone  and cupped his chin in his hands, staring  eastwards but seeing little with his eyes. All that had happened since Bilbo  left the Shire was passing through his mind,  and he  recalled and  pondered   everything  that he could  remember  of Gandalf's words.  Time went on,  and  still he was no nearer to a choice.       Suddenly he awoke from his thoughts: a strange feeling came to him that  something was behind him, that unfriendly eyes were upon  him. He sprang  up  and turned; but all that  he saw to his  surprise was Boromir, and his  face  was smiling and kind.       `I was afraid for  you, Frodo,' he said, coming forward. `If Aragorn is  right and Orcs are near,  then none of us should wander alone, and you least   of all: so much depends on you. And my heart too  is heavy. May  I  stay now  and talk for a  while,  since  I have found  you? It would comfort me. Where  there are so many, all speech becomes a debate without end. But two together   may perhaps find wisdom.'       `You are kind,'  answered Frodo. 'But  I do not think  that  any speech  will help me.  For  I know what I should do, but I  am  afraid of doing  it,  Boromir: afraid.'       Boromir stood  silent. Rauros roared endlessly on. The wind murmured in  the branches of the trees. Frodo shivered.       Suddenly Boromir came and sat beside him. `Are you sure that you do not  suffer needlessly? ' he said. `I wish to help you. You need counsel in  your  hard choice. Will you not take mine? '       'I  think I know already  what counsel you would  give, Boromir,'  said  Frodo. 'And it would seem like wisdom but for the warning of my heart.'       `Warning? Warning against what? ' said Boromir sharply.       'Against  delay. Against the  way that seems easier. Against refusal of   ####-the  burden  that  is laid on me. Against -well,  if it must be said, against   trust in the strength and truth of Men.'       `Yet that  strength has  long  protected you far  away  in  your little  country, though you knew it not.'       'I do not doubt the valour of  your  people. But the world is changing.  The  walls of Minas Tirith may be strong, but they are not strong enough. If  they fail, what then? '       'We shall fall in battle valiantly.  Yet there is still hope  that they  will not fail.'       'No hope while the Ring lasts,' said Frodo.       'Ah! The Ring! '  said Boromir, his eyes lighting. 'The Ring! Is it not  a strange fate that we should suffer so much fear and doubt  for so  small a   thing? So small a thing! And I have seen it only for an instant in the House  of Elrond. Could I not have a sight of it again? '       Frodo looked  up. His heart went suddenly cold.  He caught the  strange  gleam in  Boromir's eyes, yet his face was still kind  and friendly.  'It is  best that it should lie hidden,' he answered.       'As you wish. I care  not,' said Boromir.  'Yet may I not even speak of  it? For you seem ever to think only of its power in the hands  of the Enemy:   of  its evil  uses not  of its good."
