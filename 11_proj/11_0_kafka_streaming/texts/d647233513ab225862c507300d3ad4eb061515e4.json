Besides, I want to ride out and taste this country of yours.  Ser Boros and Ser Meryn waited behind him with a dozen guardsmen, Ned saw. There was nothing to do but rub the sleep from his eyes, dress, and mount up.  Robert set the pace, driving his huge black destrier hard as Ned galloped along beside him, trying to keep up. He called out a question as they rode, but the wind blew his words away, and the king did not hear him. After that Ned rode in silence. They soon left the kingsroad and took off across rolling plains dark with mist. By then the guard had fallen back a small distance, safely out of earshot, but still Robert would not slow.  Dawn broke as they crested a low ridge, and finally the king pulled up. By then they were miles south of the main party. Robert was flushed and exhilarated as Ned reined up beside him.  Gods,  he swore, laughing,  it feels good to get out and ride the way a man was meant to ride! I swear, Ned, this creeping along is enough to drive a man mad.  He had never been a patient man, Robert Baratheon.  That damnable wheelhouse, the way it creaks and groans, climbing every bump in the road as if it were a mountain… I promise you, if that wretched thing breaks another axle, I’m going to burn it, and Cersei can walk!   Ned laughed.  I will gladly light the torch for you.    Good man!  The king clapped him on the shoulder.  I’ve half a mind to leave them all behind and just keep going.   A smile touched Ned’s lips.  I do believe you mean it.    I do, I do,  the king said.  What do you say, Ned? Just you and me, two vagabond knights on the kingsroad, our swords at our sides and the gods know what in front of us, and maybe a farmer’s daughter or a tavern wench to warm our beds tonight.    Would that we could,  Ned said,  but we have duties now, my liege… to the realm, to our children, I to my lady wife and you to your queen. We are not the boys we were.    You were never the boy you were,  Robert grumbled.  More’s the pity. And yet there was that one time… what was her name, that common girl of yours? Becca? No, she was one of mine, gods love her, black hair and these sweet big eyes, you could drown in them. Yours was… Aleena? No. You told me once. Was it Merryl? You know the one I mean, your bastard’s mother?    Her name was Wylla,  Ned replied with cool courtesy,  and I would sooner not speak of her.    Wylla. Yes.  The king grinned.  She must have been a rare wench if she could make Lord Eddard Stark forget his honor, even for an hour. You never told me what she looked like…   Ned’s mouth tightened in anger.  Nor will I. Leave it be, Robert, for the love you say you bear me. I dishonored myself and I dishonored Catelyn, in the sight of gods and men.    Gods have mercy, you scarcely knew Catelyn.    I had taken her to wife. She was carrying my child.    You are too hard on yourself, Ned. You always were. Damn it, no woman wants Baelor the Blessed in her bed.  He slapped a hand on his knee.  Well, I’ll not press you if you feel so strong about it, though I swear, at times you’re so prickly you ought to take the hedgehog as your sigil.   The rising sun sent fingers of light through the pale white mists of dawn. A wide plain spread out beneath them, bare and brown, its flatness here and there relieved by long, low hummocks. Ned pointed them out to his king.  The barrows of the First Men.   Robert frowned.  Have we ridden onto a graveyard?    There are barrows everywhere in the north, Your Grace,  Ned told him.  This land is old.    And cold,  Robert grumbled, pulling his cloak more tightly around himself. The guard had reined up well behind them, at the bottom of the ridge.  Well, I did not bring you out here to talk of graves or bicker about your bastard. There was a rider in the night, from Lord Varys in King’s Landing. Here.  The king pulled a paper from his belt and handed it to Ned.  Varys the eunuch was the king’s master of whisperers. He served Robert now as he had once served Aerys Targaryen. Ned unrolled the paper with trepidation, thinking of Lysa and her terrible accusation, but the message did not concern Lady Arryn.  What is the source for this information?    Do you remember Ser Jorah Mormont?    Would that I might forget him,  Ned said bluntly. The Mormonts of Bear Island were an old house, proud and honorable, but their lands were cold and distant and poor. Ser Jorah had tried to swell the family coffers by selling some poachers to a Tyroshi slaver. As the Mormonts were bannermen to the Starks, his crime had dishonored the north. Ned had made the long journey west to Bear Island, only to find when he arrived that Jorah had taken ship beyond the reach of Ice and the king’s justice. Five years had passed since then.   Ser Jorah is now in Pentos, anxious to earn a royal pardon that would allow him to return from exile,  Robert explained."
