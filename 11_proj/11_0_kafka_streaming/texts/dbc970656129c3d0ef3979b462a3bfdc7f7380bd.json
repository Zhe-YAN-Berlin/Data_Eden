In winter  here  no  heart  could  mourn for summer  or  for spring.  No  blemish  or sickness or   deformity could be seen in anything that grew upon the earth. On the land of  Lurien there was no stain.       He  turned  and saw that Sam was now standing beside him, looking round  with a  puzzled expression, and rubbing his eyes as  if he was not sure that  he was  awake. `It's  sunlight  and bright  day, right enough,'  he said. `I   thought that Elves were all for moon and stars: but this is more elvish than  anything I ever heard tell of. I feel as if I was  inside a song. if you take  my meaning.'       Haldir looked at them, and he seemed indeed to take the meaning of both  thought  and  word.  He  smiled. `You  feel the  power of  the  Lady of  the  Galadhrim,' he said. `Would it please you  to climb with me up Cerin Amroth?   '       They followed  him  as  he stepped lightly up  the  grass-clad  slopes.   Though he walked and  breathed, and about him living leaves and flowers were  stirred by the same cool wind as fanned his face, Frodo felt that  he was in  a timeless land that did not fade or change or fall into forgetfulness. When  he had gone and passed again into  the outer world, still Frodo the wanderer   from the Shire would walk there, upon the  grass among  elanor and niphredil  in fair Lothlurien.       They entered the circle of white trees. As they did so the  South  Wind  blew  upon Cerin Amroth and  sighed among the  branches. Frodo  stood still,  hearing far off_ great seas upon beaches that had long ago been washed away,  and sea -birds crying whose race had perished from the earth.       Haldir  had gone on and was  now  climbing to the high  flet. As  Frodo  prepared to follow him,  he laid his hand  upon the  tree beside the ladder:  never before had  he been  so  suddenly and so keenly aware of the  feel and  texture of a tree's skin and of the life within  it. He  felt  a  delight in  wood and  the touch of it, neither  as forester nor as carpenter; it was the  delight of the living tree itself.       As he stepped out at last upon the lofty platform, Haldir took his hand  and turned him toward the South. `Look this way first! ' he said.       Frodo looked  and saw, still at some  distance, a  hill of many  mighty  trees, or a city of green towers: which it was he could not tell. Out of it,  it seemed  to him that the  power and light came that held all the  land  in   ####-sway. He longed suddenly to fly like a bird to rest in the  green city. Then   he looked  eastward and  saw all the land of Lurien running down to  the pale   gleam of Anduin, the Great  River.  He lifted his  eyes across the river and  all the light went out, and he  was back again in the world he knew.  Beyond  the river  the land  appeared flat and empty,  formless and vague, until far  away  it  rose  again  like  a  wall, dark  and drear.  The sun that lay  on  Lothlurien had no power to enlighten the shadow of that distant height.       `There  lies  the fastness of  Southern  Mirkwood,' said Haldir. `It is  clad in a forest of dark fir, where the trees strive one against another and  their branches rot and wither. In the midst upon a  stony height  stands Dol  Guldur, where long the hidden Enemy had his dwelling. We fear that now it is  inhabited again,  and with power sevenfold. A black cloud lies often over it  of  late. In this high place you may see the two powers that are opposed one   to another;  and ever  they  strive now  in thought,  but whereas the  light  perceives  the very  heart of  the darkness,  its  own  secret has not  been  discovered. Not yet.' He turned and climbed swiftly down, and  they followed  him.       At the hill's foot Frodo found Aragorn, standing still  and silent as a   tree; but in his hand was a small golden bloom of elanor, and a light was in  his eyes. He was wrapped in some fair memory: and as Frodo looked  at him he  knew that he beheld things as they once had been in this same place. For the  grim years were removed from the  face of Aragorn, and he  seemed clothed in  white, a  young lord  tall and fair; and he spoke words in the Elvish tongue  to one whom Frodo could not see . Arwen vanimelda, nambril! he said, and then  he drew a breath, and returning  out  of his thought  he looked at Frodo and  smiled.       `Here  is the  heart of Elvendom on earth,' he said, `and here my heart  dwells  ever,  unless there  be a light beyond the dark roads that  we still  must tread, you and I. Come with  me!  ' And taking Frodo's hand in  his, he  left the hill of Cerin Amroth and came there never again as living man.     ####-   Chapter 7. The Mirror of Galadriel            The  sun  was  sinking  behind  the  mountains,  and the  shadows  were  deepening in the woods, when  they went on again."
