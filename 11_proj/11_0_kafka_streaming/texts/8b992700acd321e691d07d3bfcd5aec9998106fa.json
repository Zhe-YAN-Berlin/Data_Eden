  "text": " But if doom denies this to me, then I will  have naught: neither life diminished, nor love halved, nor honour abated.'       'To me it would  not seem that a Steward who  faithfully surrenders his  charge is diminished in love  or in honour,' said Gandalf. 'And at the least  you shall not rob your son of his choice while his death is still in doubt.'       At those words Denethor's eyes flamed again, and taking the Stone under   his arm  he drew a knife and  strode towards the  bier. But  Beregond sprang  forward and set himself before Faramir.       'So!' cried Denethor. 'Thou hadst  already  stolen  half my son's love.  Now thou stealest the hearts of  my knights also, so that they rob me wholly   of my son at the last. But in this at least thou shalt not defy  my will: to  rule my own end.'   ####-     'Come  hither!'  he cried  to his servants. 'Come,  if you are  not all  recreant!'  Then two of them ran up the steps to  him. Swiftly he snatched a   torch from the hand of  one  and  sprang back into the house. Before Gandalf  could hinder him he  thrust the brand amid the fuel, and at once it crackled  and roared into flame.       Then Denethor  leaped upon  the  table, and  standing there wreathed in  fire and smoke he took up the staff  of his stewardship that lay at his feet  and broke  it on his  knee.  Casting the pieces into  the blaze he bowed and  laid himself  on  the table, clasping the palantnr with both hands upon  his  breast. And  it was said that ever after, if  any man  looked in that Stone,  unless he had a great strength of will to  turn it to other purpose, he  saw  only two aged hands withering in flame.       Gandalf in grief and horror turned his face away  and closed the  door.  For  a  while  he stood in thought,  silent  upon the threshold, while those  outside heard the greedy roaring of  the fire within. And then Denethor gave  a great cry, and afterwards spoke no more, nor was ever again seen by mortal  men.       'So passes Denethor, son of Ecthelion,' said Gandalf: Then he turned to  Beregond and the Lord's servants that stood there aghast.  'And so pass also  the days of Gondor that you have known; for good or evil they are ended. Ill  deeds  have been done here; but let now  all enmity that lies between you be  put away, for  it  was contrived by the Enemy and works  his  will. You have  been  caught  in a net of warring duties that  you did not weave. But think,  you servants of the Lord, blind in your obedience, that but  for the treason  of Beregond Faramir, Captain of the White Tower, would now also be burned.       'Bear away  from this unhappy place your comrades who  have fallen. And  we  will bear  Faramir, Steward of Gondor, to  a place where he can sleep in  peace, or die if that be his doom.'       Then Gandalf and Beregond taking  up the bier bore  it away towards the  Houses of  Hea ling,  while behind them walked Pippin with downcast head.  But  the servants of the Lord  stood gazing as stricken  men  at the house of the  dead; and even  as Gandalf  came to the end of Rath Dnnen there was a  great  noise. Looking back  they  saw the  dome of the house crack and smokes issue  forth; and then with a rush and rumble of stone it fell in a flurry of fire;  but still unabated the flames danced and  flickered among the ruins. Then in  terror the servants fled and followed Gandalf.    ####-     At length they came back  to  the Steward's Door,  and  Beregond looked   with grief  at  the porter. 'This deed I  shall  ever rue,'  he said; 'but a   madness of haste was on  me, and he would not listen, but drew sword against   me.' Then  taking  the key that he had  wr ested from the slain man he closed  the door and locked it.  'This should now be given to the Lord  Faramir,' he  said.       'The Prince  of Dol Amroth is in  command in the absence of  the Lord,'  said Gandalf; 'but since he is not here,  I must take this on  myself. I bid  you keep the key and guard it, until the City is set in order again.'       Now  at last they passed  into the high circles of the City, and in the  light of morning  they went their way towards  the  Houses  of Healing;  and  these were  fair houses set apart, for the care of those who were grievously  sick, but now  they were prepared  for the tending of men  hurt in battle or   dying. They stood not far from  the  Citadel-gate, in the sixth circle, nigh  to  its southward  wall, and about  them was a  garden and a greensward with  trees,  the only such place in the City. There dwelt the few women  that had  been permitted to remain in Minas Tirith, since they were skilled in healing  or in the service of the healers.        But even  as Gandalf and his companions came  carrying the bier  to the  main door of the  Houses, they heard a great cry that went up from the field  before the Gate and rising shrill and piercing into the sky passed, and died  away on the wind. So terrible was the cry that for a moment all stood still,  and  yet when it  had passed, suddenly their hearts were lifted up in such a   hope as they had not known  since the darkness came  out of the East; and it   seemed  to them that  the  light grew  clear and the sun  broke  through the  clouds."
