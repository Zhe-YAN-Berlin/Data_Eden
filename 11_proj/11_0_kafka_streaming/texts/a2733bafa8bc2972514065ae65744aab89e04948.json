I  fear  that your  heart  spoke truly,  Legolas: it is thrice  twelve hours, I guess, since the Orcs stood where we now stand. If they held  to their pace,  then  at sundown  yesterday they would reach  the borders of  Fangorn.'       'I can see nothing  away north or west but  grass dwindling into mist,'  said Gimli. 'Could we see the forest, if we climbed the hills?'       'It is  still  far  away,'  said Aragorn. 'If I remember rightly, these  downs run  eight leagues  or  more to the north, and then north-west to  the  issuing of the Entwash there lies still a wide land. another fifteen leagues  it may be.'       'Well, let  us go on,' said Gimli. 'My legs must forget the miles. They  would be more willing, if my heart were less heavy.'       The sun was sinking when at last they drew near to the  end of the line  of  downs.  For many  hours they had  marched without rest. They  were going  slowly now, and Gimli's back was bent.  Stone-hard are the Dwarves in labour  or journey, but this endless  chase began to tell on him, as all hope failed  in his heart. Aragorn walked behind  him, grim and silent,  stooping now and  again to scan some print or mark upon the ground. Only Legolas still stepped  as  lightly as ever,  his feet hardly seeming to press the grass. leaving no  footprints  as he passed; but in  the waybread of the Elves he found all the  sustenance tha t he needed, and  he could sleep, if sleep it  could be called  by Men, resting his mind in the strange  paths of elvish dreams,  even as he  walked open-eyed in the light of this world.       'Let us go  up on to this green hill!' he said.  Wearily they  fol lowed  him, climbing the long slope, until  they  came out upon the  top. It  was a   round hill smooth and  bare, standing by itself,  the  most northerly of the  downs. The sun sank  and  the  shadows of evening fell  like a curtain. They   were alone  in a gr ey formless world without mark or measure. Only  far away  north-west  there  was  a  deeper darkness  against  the  dying  light:  the  Mountains of Mist and the forest at their feet.       'Nothing can  we see to guide us here,' said Gimli. 'Well, now we  must   halt again and wear the night away. It is growing cold!'       'The wind is north from the snows,' said Aragorn.       'And ere morning  it will be in  the East,' said Legolas.  'But rest if   ####-you must. Yet  do  not cast all hope away. Tomorrow is unknown.  Rede oft is  found at the rising of the Sun.'       'Three  suns already have risen on  our  chase and brought no counsel '  said Gimli.       The  night  grew  ever  colder.  Aragorn  and Gimli slept fitfully, and  whenever they awoke they saw Legolas standing beside them, or walking to  and  fro, singing softly to  himself in his own tongue, and as  he sang the white  stars  opened in  the hard black vault above. So the  night passed. Together   they watched the dawn grow slowly in the  sky, now bare and cloudless, until  at  last the sunrise came. It was pale and clear. The  wind was  in the East   and  all the mists had rolled away;  wide lands lay bleak about them in  the  bitter light.       Ahead and eastward they saw the windy uplands of the Wold of Rohan that  they had already glimpsed many days ago from the Great River. North- westward  stalked the dark forest of Fangorn; still ten leagues away stood its shadowy  eaves, and its  further  slopes  faded into  the distant blue. Beyond  there  glimmered far away, as if floating  on a  grey cloud, the white head of tall  Methedras, the  last  peak  of  the  Misty Mountains. Out of  the forest the  Entwash flowed to meet them, its  stream now swift and narrow, and its banks  deep-cloven. The orc-trail turned from the downs towards it.       Following with his keen eyes the trail to the river, and then the river   back towards the forest,  Aragorn saw a shadow on the distant green,  a dark   swift-moving  blur.  He cast  himself upon  the  ground  and  listened again  intently.  But Legolas stood beside him, shading  his bright elven-eyes with  his long slender hand, and he saw not a  shadow, nor  a blur, but the  small  figures  of horsemen, many horsemen, and the glint of morning on the tips of  their spears was  like the twinkle of minute stars beyond the edge of mortal  sight. Far behind them a dark smoke rose in thin curling threads.        There was a silence  in the empty fields, arid Gimli could hear the air  moving in the grass.        'Riders!' cried Aragorn, springing to  his feet.  'Many riders on swift  steeds are coming towards us!'       'Yes,' said Legolas, 'there are one hundred  and five. Yellow is  their  hair, and bright are their spears. Their leader is very tall.'       Aragorn smiled. 'Keen are the eyes of the Elves,' he said.   ####-     'Nay!  The  riders are little  more  than  five leagues distant,'  said  Legolas."
