I have now a last task   to do  before I  go: I must pay Saruman  a  farewell visit.  Dangerous,  and  probably  u seless; but it must be done.  Those of you who wish may come with  me -- but beware! And do not jest! This is not the time for it.'       'I will  come,' said Gimli. 'I wish to see him and  learn  if he really  looks like you.'       'And how will you learn  that,  Master Dwarf?'  said  Gandalf. 'Saruman   ####-could  look like me in your eyes, if it suited his purpose with you. And are  you yet wise enough  to detect  all  his  counterfeits? Well, we shall  see,  perhaps.  He  may  be  shy  of  showing himself before many  different  eyes  together. But I have ordered all  the Ents to remove  themselves from sight,  so perhaps we shall persuade him to come out.'       'What's the danger?' asked Pippin. 'Will he shoot at  us, and pour fire  out of the windows; or can he put a spell on us from a distance?'       'The last is most likely, if you ride to his door with a light  heart,'  said Gandalf. 'But there is no knowing what he can do, or may choose to try.   A wild beast cornered is not safe to approach. And Saruman has powers you do  not guess. Beware of his voice!'       They  came  now to  the foot of Orthanc.  It  was black, and  the  rock   gleamed as if it were wet. The  many  faces of the  stone had sharp edges as  though they had been newly chiselled. A  few  scorings. and small flake-like  splinters near the base, were all the marks that it bore of the fury  of the  Ents.       On the eastern side, in the angle of two piers, there was a great door,  high above the  ground; and over it was a  shuttered window, opening upon  a  balcony hedged with iron bars. Up to the threshold of the door there mounted  a flight of twenty-seven broad stairs, hewn  by some unknown art of the same  black stone. This was the only entrance to the tower;  but many tall windows  were cut with deep embrasures in the climbing walls: far up they peered like  little eyes in the sheer faces of the horns.       At the  foot of the  stairs Gandalf and the king dismounted. 'I will go  up,' said Gandalf. 'I have been in Orthanc and I know my peril.'       'And I too will go up,' said the king. 'I am old, and fear no peril any  more.  I wish to speak with the enemy who has  done me so  much wrong.  Jomer  shall come with me, and see that my aged feet do not falter.'       'As you  will,' said  Gandalf. 'Aragorn shall  come with  me.  Let  the  others await us at the foot of the stairs. They will hear and see enough, if  there is anything to hear or see.'       'Nay!' said Gimli. 'Legolas and I wish for a closer view. We alone here  represent our kindred. We also will come behind.'       'Come  then!' said Gandalf, and  with that  he climbed the  steps,  and  Thjoden went beside him.       The Riders of Rohan sat  uneasily upon their horses,  on either side of   ####-the stair,  and  looked  up darkly  at  the great  tower, fearing what might  befall their lord.  Merry and  Pippin  sat on the bottom step,  feeling both  unimportant and unsafe.       'Half a sticky mile from here to the gate!' muttered Pippin.  'I wish I  could slip off back to the guardroom unnoticed! What did we come for? We are  not wanted.'       Gandalf stood before the door of Orthanc and beat on it with his staff.   It  rang  with  a  hollow  sound.  'Saruman, Saruman!'  he  cried in a  loud  commanding voice.  'Saruman come forth!'       For  some time there was no answer.  At  last the window above the door   was unbarred, hut no figure could be seen at its dark opening.       'Who is it?' said a voice. 'What do you wish?'       Thjoden started.  'I know that  voice,' he said, 'and I  curse  the day  when I first listened to it.'       'Go  and  fetch Saruman,  since  you  have  become  his footman,  Grnma   Wormtongue!' said Gandalf.  'And do not waste our time!'       The window closed. They  waited.  Suddenly another voice spoke, low and  melodious, its very sound  an enchantment.  Those who  listened  unwarily to  that voice could seldom  report the words that they heard;  and if they did,  they wondered,  for  little power remained  in them. Mostly they  remembered  only that it was a delight to  hear the  voice  speaking, all  that it  said  seemed wise and  reasonable, and desire awoke in them  by swift agreement to  seem  wise themselves.  When others  spoke  they seemed harsh and uncouth  by  contrast; and if they gainsaid the voice, anger was kindled in the hearts of  those under the spell. Fur some the spell lasted only while the voice  spoke  to them, and when it spake to another they smiled, as men do who see through  a  juggler's trick while others gape at it. For many the sound  of the voice  alone was enough  to hold  them enthralled; but for those whom it  conquered  the  spell endured when they were  far away."
