  "text": "        Whether the morning and evening of  one  day or of many days had passed  Frodo could not tell.  He did not feel either hungry  or tired,  only filled  with  wonder.  The  stars shone through the window and the  silence  of  the   heavens seemed  to be round  him. He spoke at  last out  of his wonder and a    ####-sudden fear of that silence:       'Who are you, Master?' he asked.       'Eh, what?' said  Tom sitting up,  and  his eyes glinting in the gloom.  'Don't you know my name yet? That's the only  answer. Tell me,  who are you,  alone, yourself and nameless? But you are young and I am old. Eldest, that's  what I am. Mark my words, my friends: Tom was here before  the river and the  trees;  Tom remembers the first raindrop and the first  acorn. He made paths  before  the Big  People,  and saw  the  little People arriving.  He was here  before the Kings and the graves and the Barrow-wights. When the Elves passed  westward, Tom was here already, before the  seas were bent. He knew the dark  under  the stars when it  was  fearless  -  before  the Dark  Lord came  from  Outside.'       A shadow seemed to pass by the  window, and the hobbits glanced hastily  through  the  panes.  When they  turned again, Goldberry stood  in the  door   behind,  framed in  light. She held a  candle, shielding its flame  from the  draught  with her hand;  and the  light  flowed through  it,  like  sunlight  through a white shell.       'The  rain has ended,' she said; 'and new waters are running  downhill,  under the stars. Let us now laugh and be glad!'       'And let us have  food and drink!' cried Tom. 'Long tales are  thirsty.  And long listening's hungry work, morning, noon,  and evening!' With that he  jumped  out  of  his  chair,  and  with  a  bound took  a  candle  from  the  chimney-shelf and lit it  in the flame that Goldberry held;  then he  danced  about the table. Suddenly he hopped through the door and disappeared.       Quickly  he returned, bearing a  large and laden  tray.  Then  Tom  and  Goldberry  set the table; and  the  hobbits sat  half in  wonder and half in  laughter: so  fair  was  the grace  of Goldberry  and so  merry and odd  the  caperings of Tom. Yet in some fashion they  seemed to  weave a single dance,  neither hindering the other, in  and out of  the  room, and  round about the  table; and with great speed food and vessels and  lights were set  in order.  The boards blazed with candles, white and yellow.  Tom bowed to his  guests.   'Supper is ready,'  said Goldberry; and now the  hobbits  saw that  she  was  clothed all in silver with  a white girdle, and her  shoes were like fishes'  mail. But Tom was all in clean blue, blue as rain -washed forget-me-nots, and  he had green stockings.        It was a supper even better than before. The hobbits under the spell of   ####-Tom's words may have  missed one meal or many,  but when the food was  before  them it seemed at  least a week  since they had eaten. They did not  sing or   even speak much for a while, and paid close attention to business. But after   a time their hearts and spirit rose high again, and their voices rang out in  mirth and laughter.       After they had eaten,  Goldberry  sang many songs for them, songs  that  began  merrily  in the  hills and fell softly down into  silence; and in the  silences they saw in their minds pools and  waters wider  than any  they had  known, and looking into them they  saw the sky below them and the stars like  jewels in the  depths. Then  once more she wished them  each  good night and  left them by the fireside. But Tom now seemed wide awake and plied them  with  questions.        He appeared already to know much about them and all their families, and   indeed  to know much of  all the history  and doings of  the Shire down from   days hardly remembered among the hobbits  themselves. It  no longer surprised  them; but he  made no secret that he owed  his  recent knowledge  largely to  Farmer Maggot, whom he seemed to regard as a person of more  importance  than  they had imagined.  'There's earth under  his  old  feet, and  clay  on  his  fingers; wisdom in his bones, and both  his eyes are open,' said Tom. It was  also clear that Tom  had dealings with the Elves, and it seemed that in some   fashion, news had reached him from Gildor concerning the flight of Frodo.       Indeed  so much did Tom know, and so cunning  was his questioning, that  Frodo found himself telling him more about Bilbo and his own hopes and fears  than he  had told before even to  Gandalf. Tom wagged  his head up and down,  and there was a glint in his eyes when he heard of the Riders.       'Show me  the  precious  Ring!'  he said suddenly  in the  midst of the  story: and  Frodo, to his  own astonishment,  drew  out the chain  from  his  pocket, and unfastening the Ring handed it at once to Tom.       It  seemed  to  grow  larger  as  it  lay  for  a  moment  on  his  big  brown-skinned hand. Then suddenly he put it  to his eye  and laughed."
