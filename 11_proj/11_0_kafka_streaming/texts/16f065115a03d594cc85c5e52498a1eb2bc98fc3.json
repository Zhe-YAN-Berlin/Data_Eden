Before  them  dark in  the dawn the great  mountains  reached up to roofs of smoke and cloud. Out from  their feet were flung huge  buttresses  and  broken hills  that were now at the nearest  scarce a  dozen  miles away. Frodo looked round  in horror. Dreadful as the Dead  Marshes had  been, and  the  arid moors  of the  Noman-lands, more loathsome  far was the  country that the  crawling day now  slowly  unveiled  to his shrinking eyes.   Even to the  Mere  of Dead Faces some haggard phantom of  green spring  would  come; but here neither spring nor summer would ever come again. Here  nothing  lived,  not  even the  leprous growths that feed on rottenness. The  gasping  pools were choked  with ash and crawling muds, sickly white and grey, as  if  the mountains had vomited the filth of  their entrails upon the lands about.  High  mounds of crushed and powdered rock, great cones of earth fire-blasted  and  poison-stained, stood like an obscene graveyard in endless rows, slowly   revealed in the reluctant light.       They  had come to  the desolation that lay  before Mordor:  the lasting  monument to the dark labour of its slaves that should  endure when all their  purposes were  made  void; a  land defiled,  diseased beyond  all healing --  unless the Great  Sea should enter in and  wash  it with oblivion.  `I  feel  sick,' said Sam. Frodo did not speak.       For a while  they stood there, like men on the edge  of a  sleep  where  nightmare lurks, holding it off, though they know that they can only come to  morning  through the  shadows. The light broadened and hardened. The  gasping  pits and  poisonous mounds grew hideously clear.  The  sun  was up,  walking   ####-among clouds and long flags of smoke, but even the sunlight was defiled. The  hobbits had no welcome for that light; unfriendly  it seemed, revealing them  in their helplessness  --  little squeaking ghosts that  wandered among  the  ash-heaps of the Dark Lord.       Too weary  to go  further  they sought for some place where they  could  rest. For a while  they sat without speaking  under the shadow of a mound of  slag; but foul fumes  leaked out of it, catching their  throats and  choking  them. Gollum was the first to get up. Spluttering  and  cursing he rose, and  without  a  word or  a glance at the hobbits  he crawled  away on all fours.   Frodo and Sam crawled  after him, until  they came to a wide almost circular  pit, high-banked upon the west. It was  cold and dead, and  a foul  sump  of  oily many-coloured ooze lay at its bottom.  In  this evil hole they cowered,  hoping in its shadow to escape the attention of the Eye.       The  day passed  slowly. A  great thirst troubled  them, but they drank   only a few  drops from their bottles-last filled in  the gully, which now as  they looked back in thought seemed to  them a place of peace and beauty. The  hobbits  took it in turn to watch. At first, tired as they  were, neither of  them could sleep at all; but as the sun far away was climbing down into slow  moving cloud, Sam dozed. It was Frodo's turn to bc on  guard. He lay back on  the slope of the pit, but that did not ease the sense  of burden that was on  him. He looked  up at the  smoke-streaked sky and saw strange phantoms, dark  riding shapes, and  faces  out of the past. He  lost count of time, hovering  between sleep and waking, until forgetfulness came over him.       Suddenly Sam woke up thinking that he heard his master calling.  It was  evening. Frodo could not have called, for he had fallen asleep, and had slid  down nearly to the  bottom of  the pit. Gollum was by  him. For a moment Sam  thought that he was trying to  rouse Frodo; then he saw that it was  not so.  Gollum was talking to himself. Smjagol was holding a  debate with some other  thought  that used the same voice but  made it squeak and hiss. A pale light  and a green light alternated in his eyes as he spoke.       `Smjagol promised,' said the first thought.       `Yes,  yes, my precious,' came  the  answer, 'we promised: to  save our  Precious, not to let Him have it -- never. But it's going to Him yes, nearer   every step.  What's the hobbit going  to  do  with it,  we wonders,  yes  we  wonders.'       `I don't know. I can't help it. Master's  got it. Smjagol  promised  to  help the master.'   ####-     `Yes,  yes, to  help the master: the  master of the Precious. But if we  was master, then we could help ourselfs, yes, and still keep promises.'       `But Smjagol said  he  would be very  very good.  Nice  hobbit! He took   cruel rope off Smjagol's leg. He speaks nicely to me.'       'Very very good, eh, my precious? Let's be  good,  good as fish,  sweet   one, but to ourselfs. Not hurt the nice hobbit, of course, no, no.'       `But the Precious holds the promise,' the voice of Smjagol objected.       `Then take it,' said  the other,  `and let's hold it ourselfs!  Then we  shall be master, gollum! Make the other hobbit, the nasty suspicious hobbit,  make him crawl, yes, gollum!'       `But not the nice hobbit? '       `Oh no, not if it doesn't please us."
