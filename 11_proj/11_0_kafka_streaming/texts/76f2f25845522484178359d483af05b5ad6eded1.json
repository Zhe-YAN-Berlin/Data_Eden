Beneath  him,  under  all  his  limbs  and  his  huge  coiled  tail,  and  about  him  on  all  sides  stretching  away  across  the  unseen  floors,  lay  countless  piles  of  precious  things,  gold wrought and unwrought, gems and jewels, and silver red-stained in the ruddy  light.  Smaug  lay, with wings  folded  like  an  immeasurable bat,  turned partly on one  side,  so  that  the  hobbit  could  see  his  underparts  and  his  long  pale  belly  crusted  with  gems  and  fragments  of  gold  from  his  long  lying  on  his  costly  bed.  Behind  him  where  the  walls  were  nearest  could  dimly  be  seen  coats  of  mail,  helms  and  axes,  swords  and  spears  hanging;  and  there  in  rows  stood  great  jars  and  vessels  filled with a wealth that could not be guessed. To say that Bilbo's breath was taken  away  is  no  description  at  all.  There  are  no words  left  to express his  staggerment,  since Men changed the language that they learned of elves in the days when all the  world was wonderful.  Bilbo  had  heard  tell  and  sing  of  dragon-hoards before, but  the splendour, the lust, the glory of such treasure had never yet come home to him.  His heart was filled and pierced with enchantment and with the desire of dwarves;  and  he  gazed  motionless,  almost  forgetting  the  frightful  guardian,  at  the  gold  beyond price and count.    He  gazed  for  what  seemed  an  age,  before  drawn  almost  against  his  will,  he  stole  from  the  shadow  of  the  doorway,  across  the  floor  to  the  nearest  edge  of  the  mounds of treasure. Above him the sleeping dragon lay, a dire menace even in his  sleep.  He  grasped  a  great  two-handled  cup,  as  heavy  as  he  could  carry,  and  cast  one  fearful  eye  upwards. Smaug  stirred  a wing,  opened  a  claw,  the  rumble  of  his  snoring changed its note.  Then  Bilbo  fled.  But  the  dragon  did  not  wake-not  yet  but  shifted  into  other  dreams  of  greed  and  violence,  lying  there  in  his  stolen  hall while  the  little hobbit   ####-toiled back up  the  long  tunnel. His heart was beating and a more  fevered shaking  was in his legs than when he was going down, but still he clutched the cup, and his  chief  thought was:  \"I've  done  it! This will  show  them.  'More  like  a grocer  than  a  burglar' indeed! Well, we'll hear no more of that.\"  Nor did he. Balin was overjoyed to see the hobbit again, and as delighted as he  was  surprised.  He  picked  Bilbo  up  and  carried  him  out  into  the  open  air.  It  was  midnight  and  clouds  had  covered  the  stars,  but  Bilbo  lay  with  his  eyes  shut,  gasping  and  taking pleasure  in  the  feel of  the  fresh  air  again,  and hardly noticing  the  excitement  of  the  dwarves,  or  how  they  praised  him  and  patted  him  on  the  back  and  put  themselves  and  all  their  families  for  generations  to  come  at  his  service.    The  dwarves  were  still  passing  the  cup  from  hand  to  hand  and  talking  delightedly of the recovery of their treasure, when suddenly a vast rumbling woke  in  the mountain underneath as  if  it was an old volcano  that had made up its mind  to  start  eruptions  once  again.  The  door  behind  them  was  pulled  nearly  to,  and  blocked  from  closing  with  a  stone,  but  up  the  long  tunnel  came  the  dreadful  echoes, from far down in the depths, of a bellowing and a trampling that made the  ground beneath them tremble.  Then  the  dwarves  forgot  their  joy  and  their  confident  boasts  of  a  moment  before  and  cowered  down  in  fright.  Smaug was  still  to  be  reckoned with.  It  does  not  do  to  leave  a  live  dragon  out  of  your  calculations,  if  you  live  near  him.  Dragons may  not  have much  real  use  for  all  their wealth,  but  they  know  it  to  an  ounce as a rule, especially after long possession; and Smaug was no exception. He  had  passed  from  an  uneasy  dream  (in which  a warrior,  altogether  insignificant  in  size  but  provided  with  a  bitter  sword  and  great  courage,  figured  most  unpleasantly)  to  a  doze,  and  from  a  doze  to wide waking.  There was  a  breath  of  strange  air  in  his  cave.  Could  there  be  a  draught  from  that  little  hole?  He  had  never  felt  quite  happy  about  it,  though  was  so  small,  and  now  he  glared  at  it  in  suspicion an wondered why he had never blocked it up. Of late he had half fancied  he had caught the dim echoes of a knocking sound from far above that came down  through  it  to  his  lair.  He  stirred  and  stretched  forth  his  neck  to  sniff.  Then  he  missed the cup!                                        Thieves!  Fire! Murder!  Such  a  thing  had  not  happened  since  first  he  came  to  the Mountain! His rage passes description â€“ the sort of rage that is only seen when  rich  folk  that  have  more  than  they  can  enjoy  suddenly  lose  something  that  they  have  long  had  but  have  never  before  used  or  wanted."
