  "text": " What do you want now?'        'He's here with my leave,' said Frodo.  'He came to offer me his help.'       'Well, you  know your own business, maybe,' said Mr. Butterbur, looking  suspiciously  at Strider. 'But if I  was in your plight,  I wouldn't take up  with a Ranger.'       'Then who would  you take up with?' asked Strider. 'A fat innkeeper who   ####-only remembers his own name  because people  shout  it at him  all day? They  cannot stay in The  Pony for ever, and they cannot go home. They have a long  road before them. Will you go with them and keep the black men off?'       'Me? Leave Bree! I wouldn't do that for any money,' said Mr. Butterbur,  looking  really scared. 'But why can't you stay here  quiet for  a  bit, Mr.  Underhill?  What are  all  these  queer goings on? What are these black   men  after, and where do they come from, I'd like to know?'       'I'm sorry I  can't explain it all,' answered  Frodo.  'I  am tired and  very worried, and it's a long tale. But  if you mean to help me, I  ought to  warn you  that you will be in  danger  as long as I  am in your house. These  Black Riders: I am not sure, but I think, I fear they come from------'       'They  come from Mordor,'  said  Strider in a low  voice. 'From Mordor,  Barliman, if that means anything to you.'       'Save us!' cried  Mr.  Bu tterbur turning  pale; the  name evidently was  known to him. 'That is the worst news that has come to Bree in my time.' 'It  is,' said  Frodo. 'Are  you still  willing to help  me?'  'I  am,'  said Mr.  Butterbur. 'More than ever. Though I don't know what the likes of me  can do  against, against ------' he faltered.       'Against the Shadow in the  East,' said  Strider  quietly.  'Not  much,  Barliman, but  every  little  helps. You  can let  Mr. Underhill  stay  here  tonight, as Mr. Underhill, and you can forget the  name of Baggins,  till he  is far away.'       'I'll do that,' said Butterbur. 'But they'll find out he's here without  help from me, I'm afraid. It's a pity  Mr. Baggins drew attention to himself  this evening, to  say no more. The story of that  Mr. Bilbo's  going off has  been heard before tonight in Bree. Even our Nob has been doing some guessing  in his slow pate: and there are others in Bree quicker in the uptake than he  is.'       'Well, we can only hope the Riders won't come back yet,' said Frodo.       'I hope  not, indeed,' said Butterbur. 'But spooks  or no spooks,  they  won't get in The Pony so easy.  Don't you worry till the morning. Nob'll say  no word. No black man shall pass my doors, while  I can stand on my legs. Me  and my folk'll keep watch  tonight; but you had best get some  sleep, if you   can.'       'In any case we  must be called at  dawn,' said Frodo. 'We must get off  as early as possible. Breakfast at six-thirty, please.'       'Right!  I'll see to the orders,'  said the landlord. 'Good night,  Mr.   ####-Baggins - Underhill, I should say! Good night  -  now, bless me! Where's your  Mr. Brandybuck?'       'I don't know,' said Frodo with sudden anxiety. They had  forgotten all  about  Merry, and it was  getting late.  'I  am afraid  he is  out. He  said  something about going for a breath of air.'       'Well, you do want looking after and no mistake: your party might be on  a holiday!' said Butterbur. 'I must go and bar the doors quick, but I'll see  your friend is let  in when  he comes.  I'd better send Nob to look for him.  Good  night  to  you all!'  At  last  Mr. Butterbur  went out,  with another   doubtful look at Strider and  a  shake of his  head. His footsteps retreated  down the passage.       'Well?' said Strider. 'When are  you  going to open that letter?' Frodo  looked carefully at  the seal before he broke it. It seemed certainly  to be  Gandalf's. Inside, written in the  wizard's strong but  graceful script, was  the following message:       THE PRANCING PONY, BREE. Midyear's Day, Shire Year, 1418.       Dear Frodo,       Bad news has reached me here.  I must go  off at  once. You  had better  leave  Bag End  soon, and get out of the  Shire before  the  end  of July at  latest. I will return as soon  as I can; and I will follow  you,  if  I find  that you are gone. Leave a  message for me here,  if you  pass through Bree.  You can trust the landlord (Butterbur). You may meet a friend of mine on the  Road: a Man, lean, dark, tall, by some called Strider. He knows our business  and will help you. Make for  Rivendell. There I hope we may meet again. If I   do not come, Elrond will advise you.       Yours in haste        GANDALF.       PS. Do NOT use It  again, not far any reason whatever! Do not travel by  night!       PPS. Make  sure that it is the real Strider. There are many strange men  on the roads. His true name is Aragorn.       All that is gold does not glitter,       Not all those who wander are lost;       The old that is strong does not wither,       Deep roots are not reached by the frost.       From the ashes a fire shall be woken,       A light from the shadows shall spring;   ####-     Renewed shall be blade that was broken,       The crownless again shall be king."
