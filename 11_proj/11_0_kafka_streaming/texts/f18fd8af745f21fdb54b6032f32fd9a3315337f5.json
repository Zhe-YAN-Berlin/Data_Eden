But Merry had eyes only for   Aragorn,  so startling  wa s the  change that he saw  in  him, as if in one  night many  years had fallen on his head. Grim was his face, grey-hued and weary.       'I  am troubled in mind, lord,'  he said, standing by the king's horse.  'I have  heard strange words,  and I see new per ils far off. I have laboured  long  in thought, and  now  I fear that I must change my  purpose. Tell  me,  Thjoden, you ride now to Dunharrow, how long will it be ere you come there?'       'It is now a full hour past noon,' said Jomer. 'Before the night of the  third day  from  now we should  come to the Hold. The Moon will then be  one  night past his full, and the muster that the king commanded will be held the  day after. More  speed we cannot make, if  the strength of  Rohan  is to  be  gathered.'       Aragorn  was  silent for a moment. 'Three days,' he murmured, 'and  the  muster  of Rohan will  only  be begun. But  I  see  that  it  cannot now  be  hastened.'  He looked up, and it seemed that  he had made some decision; his  face  was less troubled. Then, by  our leave, lord, I must take new  counsel  for myself  and my  kindred. We must  ride  our  own road, and  no longer in   secret. For me  the time of stealth  has  passed.  I  will ride east by  the  swiftest way, and I will take the Paths of the Dead.'       'The Paths of the Dead!' said Thjoden, and trembled. 'Why do  you speak  of them?' Jomer turned and gazed at Aragorn, and it seemed to Merry that the  faces of  the Riders  that sat within  hearing turned pale at the words. 'If  there be in  truth  such paths, ' said Thjoden, 'their gate  is in Dunharrow;   but no living man may pass it.'       'Alas! Aragorn my friend!' said Jomer. 'I had hoped that we should ride  to war together; but if you seek the  Paths of the Dead, then our parting is  come, and it is little likely that we shall ever meet again under the Sun.'       'That road  I will take, nonetheless,' said Aragorn. 'But I say to you,  Jomer, that in battle  we may yet meet again, though all the hosts of Mordor   should stand between.'       'You will do as you wi ll, my lord Aragorn,' said Thjoden.  'It  is your   ####-doom, maybe,  to  tread  strange paths that  others  dare not.  This parting  grieves  me, and  my strength  is  lessened by it; but now  I must take  the  mountain-roads and delay no longer. Farewell!'       'Farewell,  lord!' said  Aragorn.  'Ride unto great  renown!  Farewell,  Merry! I leave you in  good hands,  better  than we hoped when we hunted the  orcs to Fangorn. Legolas and Gimli  will still hunt with me,  I hope; but we  shall not forget you.'       'Good-bye!'  said  Merry.  He could find no more to say.  He  felt very  small, and he was puzzled and depressed by all these gloomy words. More than  ever he  missed the  unquenchable cheerfulness  of Pippin.  The  Riders were  ready, and their horses were fidgeting;  he wished they would start arid get  it over.       Now Thjoden  spoke to Jomer, and he lifted up his hand and cried aloud,   and  with that word the Riders set forth. They  rode over the Dike  and down  the  Coomb,  and  then,  turning swiftly  eastwards, they  took  a path that  skirted  the foothills for a  mile or so, until bending south it passed back   among the hills  and disappeared from view.  Aragorn  rode  to  the Dike and  watched till  the king's men  were far down  the  Coomb.  Then he turned  to  Halbarad.       'There go three that I love, and the  smallest not the least,' he said.  'He knows not to what end he rides; yet if he knew, he still would go on.'       'A  little  people,  but  of  great worth  are  the  Shire-folk,'  said  Halbarad.  'Little do they  know of  our long  labour  for the safekeeping of  their borders, and yet I grudge it not.'       'And now our fates are  woven together,' said Aragorn. 'And yet,  alas!   here we must  part. Well, I must eat a little, and  then we also must hast en  away. Come, Legolas and Gimli! I must speak with you as I eat.'       Together they went back into  the  Burg; yet for some  time Aragorn sat  silent at  the  table in the  hall, and the others waited  for him to speak.  'Come!'  said  Legolas  at last. 'Speak and be  comforted, and shake off the  shadow! What has happened since we came  back to this grim place in the grey  morning?'       'A  struggle  somewhat grimmer  for  my  part than  the  battle of  the  Hornburg,' answered  Aragorn. 'I have  looked  in  the Stone of  Orthanc,  my   friends.'       'You have  looked in that accursed stone of  wizardry!' exclaimed Gimli  with  fear  and astonishment in his face. 'Did  you say aught to  - him? Even   ####-Gandalf feared that encounter.'       'You  forget  to whom  you speak,' said  Aragorn sternly, and his  eyes  glinted. 'Did I not openly proclaim  my  title before  the doors  of Edoras?   What do you fear that I should say to him? Nay, Gimli,' he said  in a softer   voice,  and  the grimness left  his face, and  he looked   like  one who  has  laboured  in sleepless pain for many nights."
