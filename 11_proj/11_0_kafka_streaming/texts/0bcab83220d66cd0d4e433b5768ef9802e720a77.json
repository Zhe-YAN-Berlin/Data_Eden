The memory  of  words  at the  Council came back to me: words of Saruman, half-heeded at the time.  I heard  them now clearly in my heart.       ` \"The Nine, the Seven, and the Three,\" he said, \"had each their proper   gem. Not so the  One.  It  was round  and  unadorned,  as it were one of the  lesser rings; but its maker set marks upon it that the skilled, maybe, could  still see and read.\"       `What those  marks were he had not said. Who now would know? The  maker.  And Saruman? But great though his lore may be,  it  must have a source. What  hand  save Sauron's ever  held this  thing, ere  it was  lost?  The hand  of  Isildur alone.       `With that thought, I forsook the chase, and passed swiftly  to Gondor .  In former days the members  of my order  had been  well received  there, but  Saruman most of all. Often he had  been for long  the  guest of the Lords of  the  City. Less welcome  did the Lord Denethor show me then than of old, and  grudgingly he permitted me to search among his hoarded scrolls and books.        ' \"If indeed you look only, as  you  say, for records of  ancient days,  and the beginnings of the City,  read on! \" he said.  \"For to me what was is  less dark than what is to come, and that  is  my care.  But unless you  have  more  skill even  than Saruman,  who has  studied here  long, you  will find  naught that  is not  well known to  me, who am  master of  the lore of  this  City.\"       `So said Denethor.  And yet  there lie in his  hoards many records that  few  now can read,  even of  the lore-masters, for their scripts and tongues  have become dark  to later  men.  And  Boromir, there lies in  Minas  Tirith  still, unread, I  guess,  by  any save Saruman  and  myself since the  kings  failed, a scroll  that Isildur made himself. For Isildur did not  march away  straight from the war in Mordor, as some have told the tale.'       'Some in the North, maybe,' Boromir broke in.  'All know in Gondor that  he went  first  to Minas Anor and  dwelt a while  with his nephew  Meneldil,  instructing him,  before he committed to him the  rule of the South Kingdom.  In  that time he planted there the last sapling of  the White Tree in memory  of his brother.'       `But in that time also he made this scroll,' said Gandalf;  `and that is  not remembered in Gondor, it would seem. For this scroll concerns  the Ring,   ####-and thus wrote Isildur therein:       The Great Ring shall go now to be an heirloom of the North Kingdom; but  records  of  it  shall  be left  in  Gondor,  where also dwell the  heirs of  Elendil, lest a time come when the memory of these great  matters shall grow  dim.       `And after these words Isildur described the Ring, such as he found it.       It  was  hot  when  I first took it, hot as  a glede,  and my  hand was  scorched, so that I doubt if ever again I shall be free of the pain  of  it.  Yet even as I write it is cooled, and it seemeth to shrink, though it loseth   neither  its  beauty nor its  shape. Already the  writing  upon it, which at  first was as clear as red flame, fadeth and is now  only barely to be  read.  It is fashioned in  an elven-script of  Eregion, for they have no letters in   Mordor for such subtle work; but the language is unknown to me. I deem it to  be  a tongue of the Black Land, since  it  is foul and uncouth. What evil it   saith I do  not  know; but I trace here a copy  of it,  lest it fade  beyond  recall. The Ring misseth,  maybe, the heat of Sauron's hand, which was black  and yet burned like fire, and so Gil-galad was destroyed; and maybe were the  gold made hot again, the writing would be refreshed. gut  for my part I will  risk no hurt to this thing: of all the works of Sauron the only fair. It  is  precious to me, though I buy it with great pain.       'When  I read these words, my quest was  ended. For  the traced writing  was indeed as Isildur  guessed, in the tongue of Mordor and  the servants of  the Tower. And what was said therein was already  known. For in the day that  Sauron first put on  the One, Celebrimbor, maker of the  Three, was aware of  him, and from afar he  heard him speak these words, and so his evil purposes  were revealed.       `At once  I took my leave of  Denethor, but even as  I went northwards,  messages came to me out of Lurien that Aragorn had passed that way, and that  he had found the creature called Gollum. Therefore I went  first to meet him  and hear his tale.  Into what deadly  perils  he had  gone alone I dared not  guess.'       `There is little need  to tell  of them,' said Aragorn. `If a  man must   needs walk in sight of the Black Gate, or tread the deadly flowers of Morgul  Vale, then  perils he will have. I, too, despaired at  last,  and I began my  homeward  journey.  And then, by fortune, I  came suddenly on what I sought:  the marks of soft feet beside  a muddy pool."
