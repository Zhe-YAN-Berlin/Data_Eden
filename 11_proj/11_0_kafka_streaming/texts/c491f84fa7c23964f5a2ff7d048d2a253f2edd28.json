  "text": "'       At length  Gandalf rose. 'The hands of the King  are  hands of healing,  dear friends,' he  said.  'But you  went  to the very brink of death ere  he  recalled  you,  putting forth all his power,  and  sent you  into the  sweet  forgetfulness of sleep. And though you have indeed slept long and blessedly,  still it is now time to sleep again.'       And not  only Sam and Frodo  here, said  Gimli, but you too, Pippin.  I  love you, if only because of the pains you have cost me, which I shall never   forget. Nor shall I forget  finding you on the hill of  the last battle. But  for Gimli the Dwarf you  would have been lost  then. But at least I know now  the look of a  hobbit's foot, though it be all that can be seen under a heap  of bodies.  And when  I heaved that  great  carcase off you, I made sure you   were dead. I could have.  torn out my beard. And it is only a day  yet since  you were first up and abroad again. To bed now you go. And so shall I.'       'And  I,'  said  Legolas, 'shall walk in  the woods of this  fair land,  which is rest enough. In days to come, if my Elven-lord allows, some of  our  folk shall remove hither; and when we come it shall be blessed, for a while.  For a while: a month, a life,  a hundred years  of Men.  But Anduin is near,  and Anduin leads down to the Sea. To the Sea!       To the Sea, to the Sea! The white gulls are crying,       The wind is blowing, and the white foam is flying.       West, west away, the round sun is falling.       Grey ship, grey ship, do you hear them calling.       The voices of my people that have gone before me?       I will leave, I will leave the wo ods that bore me;       For our days are ending and our years failing.       I will pass the wide waters lonely sailing.       Long are the waves on the Last Shore falling,       Sweet are the voices in the Lost Isle calling,       In Eressla, in Elvenhome that no man can discover,       Where the leaves fall not: land of my people for ever!'        And so singing Legolas went away down the hill.   ####-     Then the others also departed, and Frodo and Sam went to their beds and  slept. And in the morning they  rose again in hope and peace; and they spent  many days  in  Ithilien. For the Field of Cormallen, where the host was  now  encamped was near to Henneth  Annyn,  and  the stream that  flowed  from its  falls could be heard  in the night as it rushed down through its rocky gate,  and passed through the flowery meads into the tides of Anduin by the Isle of   Cair Andros. The hobbits wandered here  and there visiting again the  places   that  they had passed before; and Sam hoped always  in  some shadow  of  the  woods or secret glade to catch, maybe, a glimpse of the great Oliphaunt. And  when he learned that at the siege of Gondor there had been a great number of  these beasts but that they were all destroyed, he thought it a sad loss.        'Well, one  can't be everywhere  at once, I  suppose,'  he said. 'But I  missed a lot, seemingly.'       In the meanwhile  the host made  ready for  the return to Minas Tirith.  The weary rested and the hurt were healed. For some had laboured and  fought  much with the remnants  of  the  Easterlings  and Southrons, until  all were  subdued. And, latest of  all, those returned who had passed into  Mordor and  destroyed the fortresses in the north of the land.       But  at the last when the month of May was drawing near the Captains of  the West set out a gain; and they  went  aboard ship with all  their men, and  they  sailed  from  Cair Andros  down Anduin to  Osgiliath; and  there  they   remained for one day; and the day after they came to the green fields of the  Pelennor and saw again the white  towers  under tall Mindolluin, the City of  the  Men of Gondor, last memory  of Westernesse, that had passed through the  darkness and fire to a new day.       And there in the  midst of the fields they set up  their pavilions  and  awaited the morning; for it was the Eve of May, and the King would enter his  gates with the rising of the Sun.     ####-   Chapter 5. The Steward and the King            Over  the city of Gondor doubt and  great  dread had hung. Fair weather   and clear  sun had seemed but a mockery to men whose days  held  little hope,  and  who  looked each  morning  for  news  of doom. Their lord was  dead and  burned, dead lay the King of Rohan in their citadel,  and the  new king that  had  come to them in the night was gone again to  a war with powers too dark  and terrible for any might or valour to conquer. And no news came. After the  host left Morgul Vale and  took the northward road beneath the shadow of the  mountains no messenger had  returned nor any rumour  of what was passing  in  the brooding East.       When the Captains were but two days gone, the Lady Jowyn bade the  women  who tended her  to  bring her  raiment, and she would  not  be gainsaid, but  rose; and when they had clothed her and set her arm in a sling of linen, she  went to the Warden of the Houses of Healing."
