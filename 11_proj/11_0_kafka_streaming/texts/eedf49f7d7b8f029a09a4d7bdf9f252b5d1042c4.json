  "text": " He made them describe the Shire and  its country over and over  again. He  said an odd thing at  this point.  'You  never see any, hm, any Ents round  there do you?' he asked. 'Well, not Ents,   Entwives I should really say.'       'Entwives?' said Pippin. 'Are they like you at all?'       Yes,  hm,  well   no:  I  do  not  really  know   now,  said  Treebeard   ####-thoughtfully. 'But they would like your country, so I just wondered.'       Treebeard  was  however   especially  interested   in  everything  that  concerned Gandalf;  and  most  interested of  all  in Saruman's  doings. The  hobbits  regretted  very much that  they  knew so little  about them: only a   rather  vague report by Sam of what Gandalf had told  the Council.  But they   were clear  at  any rate that  UglÂ®k and  his troop  came from Isengard, and  spoke of Saruman as their master.       'Hm, hoom!'  said  Treebeard,  when at last  their story  had wound and  wandered  down to the battle of the Orcs  and  the Riders  of Rohan.  'Well,  well! That is a bundle of news and no mistake. You have not told me  all, no  indeed, not by a long way. But I do not doubt that you a re  doing as Gandalf  would wish. There is something very  big going on, that I can see, and  what  it is maybe I shall learn  in good time, or in bad time. By  root  and twig,  but  it  is a strange business: up sprout a  little folk that are not in the  old lists,  and behold  the Nine forgotten Riders reappear to hunt them, and  Gandalf takes them  on a great journey, and Galadriel harbours them in Caras  Galadhon, and Orcs pursue them down all the  leagues  of Wilderland:  indeed  they seem to be caught up in a great storm. I hope they weather it!'       'And what about yourself?' asked Merry.       'Hoom, hm, I have not troubled  about the  Great Wars,' said Treebeard;  'they mostly concern Elves and Men. That is the business of Wizards: Wizards  are always troubled  about the future.  I  do not like  worrying  about  the  future. I am not  altogether on anybody's side, because nobody is altogether   on my  side, if you understand me: nobody cares  for the woods as I care for   them, not even  Elves nowadays. Still,  I  take more kindly to Elves than  to  others: it was the Elves that cured us of  dumbness long ago, and that was a   great gift that cannot be forgotten, though our  ways have parted since. And  there are  some things, of  course, whose side I am altogether not  on; I am  against  them altogether: these -- burbrum' (he again  made a deep rumble of  disgust)' -- these Orcs, and their masters.        'I  used to  be  anxious  when the shadow lay on Mirkwood, but when  it  removed to Mordor, I did not trouble for a while : Mordor is a long way away.  But it seems that the wind is setting  East,  and the withering of all woods  may  be  drawing near.  There is naught that an old Ent can  do to hold back   that storm: he must weather it or crack.       'But Saruman now! Saruman is a neighbour: I cannot overlook him. I must   do something. I suppose. I have often wondered lately what I should do about   ####-Saruman.'       'Who is  Saruman?'  asked  Pippin.  'Do  you know  anything  about  his  history?'  'Saruman is  a  Wizard,' answered Treebeard.  'More  than  that I  cannot say. I do not know the history of Wizards. They  appeared first after   the Great Ships came over the Sea; but if they came with  the Ships  I never   can tell. Saruman was  reckoned great among them.  I  believe.  He  gave  up  wandering  about and minding the  affairs of Men and Elves, some time ago --  you would call it a very long time ago: and he settled down at Angrenost, or   Isengard  as the Men of Rohan call  it. He was very quiet to begin with, but  his fame began to gr ow. He was  chosen to be head of the White Council, they  say; but that did not turn out too well. I wonder now  if even  then Saruman  was not turning to evil ways. But at any  rate he used to give no trouble to  his neighbours. I used to talk to him.  There was a time when  he was always  walking about my woods. He was polite in  those days, always asking my leave  (at  least when he  met me); and always  eager  to  listen. I told him  many  things that he would never have found out by himself; but he never repaid me  in like kind. I  cannot remember that he ever told.  me anything. And he got  more and more like that; his face, as I remember  it-I  have not seen it for   many  a  day-became  like windows  in  a stone  wall: windows with  shutters  inside.       'I think  that I now understand  what he is  up  to. He  is plotting to  become a Power. He has a mind of metal and wheels;  and he does not care for   growing things, except as far as they serve him for the  moment.  And now it  is clear that he is a  black traitor. He has taken up  with  foul folk, with  the Orcs. Brm,  hoom! Worse than that: he  has been doing something to them;  something dangerous. For these Isengarders are more like wicked Men."
