  "text": "  Pippin roused a good deal of laughter with an account of the collapse of the  roof of the Town  Hole in Michel Delving: Will Whitfoot, the Mayor,  and the  fattest hobbit  in the Westfarthing, had  been buried in chalk, and came out  like a floured  dumpling. But there were several questions asked  that  made  Frodo a little uneasy. One of  the Bree-landers, who seemed to  have been in  the Shire  several times, wanted to know where the  Underhills lived and who  they were related to.   ####-     Suddenly  Frodo  noticed  that  a  strange-looking  weather -beaten man,  sitting in  the  shadows near the  wall, was  also listening intently to the  hobbit-talk. He had  a  tall tankard  in  front of him, and  was  smoking  a   long-stemmed pipe curiously carved. His legs  were stretched out before him,  showing high boots of supple leather that fitted him well, but had seen much  wear and were now caked with mud. A travel-stained cloak of heavy dark- green  cloth was  drawn  close  about him, and in spite of the heat of the room  he  wore a hood  that overshadowed his  face; but the gleam of his eyes could be  seen as he watched the hobbits.       'Who is that?' Frodo asked, when he  got  a chance  to  whisper  to Mr.  Butterbur. 'I don't think you introduced him?'       'Him?' said  the  landlord in  an  answering whisper,  cocking  an  eye  without  turning his head. 'I don't rightly know. He is one of the wandering  folk -Rangers we call them. He seldom talks: not but what he can tell a rare  tale when he has the mind. He disappears for a month, or a year, and then he  pops  up again. He was in and out  pretty  often last spring; but I  haven't   seen  him about lately. What his  right name is I've  never  heard: but he's  known round here as Strider. Goes  about at a great pace on his long shanks;   though  he  don't  tell nobody what cause  he has to hurry.  But there's  no  accounting for East and West, as we say in Bree, meaning the Rangers and the  Shire-folk, begging your pardon. Funny you  should  ask about  him.' But  at  that moment Mr. Butterbur was called away  by a demand for more ale  and his  last remark remained unexplained.       Frodo found that Strider was now looking at him, as if he  had heard or   guessed  all that had been said.  Presently,  with a wave of his hand and  a   nod, he invited Frodo to come over  and sit  by  him. As  Frodo drew near be   threw back his  hood, showing  a shaggy head of dark hair  necked with grey,  and in a pale stem face a pair of keen grey eyes.        'I  am called Strider,'  he said  in a low voice. 'I am very pleased to  meet you. Master - Underhill, if old Butterbur got your name right.'       'He  did,' said  Frodo stiffly. He felt far from comfortable under  the  stare of those keen eyes.        'Well, Master Underhill,' said Strider,  'if I were  you, I should stop  your  young friends  from talking too much. Drink , fire,  and chance-meeting  are pleasant enough, but, well - this  isn't the Shire. There are queer folk   about. Though I  say it as shouldn't, you may  think,'  he  added with a wry   ####-smile, seeing Frodo's glance. 'And  there have been even stranger travellers  through Bree lately,' he went on, watching Frodo's face.       Frodo returned his  gaze but said nothing; and Strider made no  further   sign.  His  attention  seemed  suddenly to be fixed on Pippin.  To his alarm  Frodo became aware that the ridiculous young Took, encouraged by his success  with  the fat  Mayor of  Michel  Delving, was  now actually  giving a  comic  account of Bilbo's farewell party. He was already giving an imitation of the  Speech, and was drawing near to the astonishing Disappearance.       Frodo was annoyed. It was a harmless enough tale for most  of the local  hobbits, no doubt: just a  funny story about  those funny people away beyond  the River;  but some (old Butterbur, for instance)  knew a thing or two, and  had probably heard rumours long ago about  Bilbo's vanishing. It would bring  the name of Baggins to their minds,  especially  if there had been inquiries  in Bree after that name.       Frodo  fidgeted,  wondering  what to  do.  Pippin  was  evidently  much  enjoying  the attention he was getting,  and had  become  quite forgetful of  their danger. Frodo had a sudden fear that in his present mood he might even  mention the Ring; and that might well be disastrous.        'You had better do something quick!' whispered Strider in his ear.       Frodo jumped up and stood on a table, and began to  talk. The attention  of Pippin's audience was disturbed. Some of the  hobbits looked at Frodo and  laughed and clapped, thinking that  Mr. Underhill  had taken as  much ale as  was good for him.       Frodo  suddenly felt very foolish,  and found himself (as was his habit  when making a speech) fingering  the things in his pocket. He felt the  Ring   on its chain, and quite unaccountably the desire came over him to slip it on  and vanish out of the silly  situation."
