  "text": " But tonight two must watch together in turns: three hours off  and one on guard.'       Nothing happened that night  worse than a brief drizzle of rain an hour  before dawn. As soon as it was fully light they started. Already the fog was  thinning. They kept as  close as they could  to  the western  side, and they  could see the dim shapes of the low cliffs rising ever higher, shadowy walls  with  their  feet in the hurrying river. In the mid-morning the  clouds drew  down  lower,  and it began to rain heavily. They drew  the  skin-covers over   their boats to prevent them from being flooded, and drifted on: little could  be seen before them or about them through the grey falling curtains.       The rain,  however, did  not  last  long.  Slowly  the  sky above  grew  lighter,  and  then  suddenly the clouds broke,  and  their draggled fringes  trailed away northward up the  River. The  fogs and mists were  gone. Before  the travellers  lay  a wide ravine, with  great rocky sides to which  clung,  upon  shelves  and in narrow crevices, a few thrawn  trees. The channel grew  narrower and the River swifter. Now  they were speeding  along  with  little   hope of stopping or turning, whatever they might meet ahead. Over them was a   lane of pale-blue sky, around them  the dark overshadowed  River, and before  them  black, shutting out  the  sun,  the hills of  Emyn Muil, in  which  no  opening could be seen.       Frodo peering  forward saw in the distance two great rocks approaching:   like  great pinnacles or pillars  of stone  they seemed.  Tall and sheer and  ominous they stood upon either  side of the  stream. A  narrow  gap appeared  between them, and the River swept the boats towards it.       `Behold the Argonath, the Pillars  of  the Kings! ' cried  Aragorn. `We  shall pass them soon. Keep the boats  in  line, and as far apart as you can!   Hold the middle of the stream! '       As Frodo was  borne towards them the great  pillars rose like towers to  meet  him.  Giants  they  seemed  to  him,  vast  grey  figures  silent  but  threatening. Then  he saw that they were  indeed shaped and  fashioned:  the  craft and power  of  old had  wrought  upon them,  and  still they preserved  through the suns and rains of forgotten years the mighty likenesses in which  they  had been hewn. Upon great pedestals founded  in the deep  waters stood  two great kings  of stone: still with blurred eyes and  crannied  brows they  frowned upon  the North. The left hand of each  was raised  palm outwards in  gesture of  warning;  in each  right  hand there  was an axe; upon each head  there  was a crumbling helm  and crown. Great  power and majesty they  still   ####-wore, the silent wardens  of a long-vanished kingdom. Awe and fear fell upon  Frodo,  and he  cowered down, shutting his eyes and not daring to look up as  the boat drew  near. Even Boromir bowed  his head  as  the boats whirled by.  frail and  fleeting  as little  leaves,  under  the  enduring  shadow of the  sentinels of NÂ®menor. So they passed into the dark chasm of the Gates.       Sheer rose the dreadful cliffs to unguessed heights on either side. Far  off was the dim sky. The black waters roared and echoed, and a wind screamed  over them.  Frodo crouching over his knees heard Sam in front  muttering and  groaning: `What a place! What a horrible place! Just let me get out of  this  boat, and I'll never wet my toes in a puddle again, let alone a river! '       `Fear  not! ' said a  strange voice behind him.  Frodo  turned and  saw  Strider, and  yet  not Strider; for  the  weatherworn Ranger  was  no longer   there.  In the  stern  sat Aragorn son of Arathorn, proud and erect, guiding  the boat with skilful strokes; his hood was cast back, and his dark hair was  blowing in the wind, a light was in his eyes:  a king returning from exile to  his own land.       'Fear not!  ' he said. `Long have I desired to look upon the likenesses  of  Isildur and Anbrion, my sires of old.  Under  their shadow  Elessar, the  Elfstone son of  Arathorn of the House  of  Valandil  Isildur's  son heir of  Elendil, has nought to dread! '       Then the light of  his eyes faded, and he spoke to himself: `Would that  Gandalf were  here! How my  heart yearns  for Minas Anor and the walls of my  own city! But whither now shall I go? '       The  chasm was long and  dark,  and filled  with the noise of wind  and  rushing water and echoing stone. It  bent somewhat  towards the west so that  at first all was dark  ahead; but soon Frodo  saw a tall gap of light before  him,  ever  growing.  Swiftly it  drew  near,  and  suddenly the  boats shot  through, out into a wide clear light.       The sun, already long fallen from the noon, was shining in a windy sky.  The pent  waters spread out into a long oval lake, pale  Nen Hithoel, fenced  by  steep grey hills whose sides were clad with trees, but  their heads were  bare,  cold-gleaming in  the sunlight. At  the far  southern end  rose three  peaks."
