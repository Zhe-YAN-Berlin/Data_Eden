The torch,  that was already burning  low  when he arrived,  sputtered and went out; and he felt the darkness cover him like a tide.  And  then softly, to his own  surprise, there at the vain end of his long journey  and his  grief, moved by what thought in his  heart he could  not  tell, Sam  began to sing.       His voice sounded thin and  quavering in the cold dark tower: the voice  of a forlorn and  weary hobbit  that no listening orc could possibly mistake  for the  clear song of an Elven-lord. He murmured  old childish tunes out of  the Shire, and snatches of Mr.  Bilbo's  rhymes that came into his mind like   ####-fleeting glimpses of the country of his home. And then suddenly new strength  rose in him, and his voice rang out, while words of his own came unbidden to  fit the simple tune.       In western lands beneath the Sun        the flowers may rise in Spring,       the trees may bud, the wa ters run,       the merry finches sing.       Or there maybe 'tis cloudless night       and swaying beeches bear       the Elven-stars as jewels white        amid their branching hair.         Though here at journey's end I lie        in darkness buried deep,       beyond all towers strong and high,       beyond all mountains steep,       above all shadows rides the Sun       and Stars for ever dwell:       I will not say the Day is done,       nor bid the Stars farewell.       `Beyond  all towers strong  and high,'  he began  again,  and  then  he  stopped short. He thought that he had heard a faint voice answering him. But  now he could  hear nothing. Yes, he  could hear something,  but not a voice.   Footsteps were  approaching.  Now  a  door was being opened  quietly in  the  passage above; the hinges  creaked. Sam crouched  down  listening.  The door   closed with a dull thud; and then a snarling orc-voice rang out.       'Ho la! You up  there, you dunghill rat! Stop your  squeaking,  or I'll  come and deal with you. D'you hear?'       There was no answer.       'All right,' growled Snaga.  `But I'll come and  have a look at you all  the same, and see what you're up to.'       The hinges creaked again, and Sam, now  peering over  the corner of the  passage-threshold, saw a flicker  of light in an open doorway, and  the  dim  shape of an orc  coming out. He seemed to be carrying a ladder. Suddenly the  answer dawned on Sam: the topmost chamber was reached  by a trap-door in  the  roof of the passage. Snaga thrust the ladder  upwards, steadied it, and then   ####-clambered  out  of  sight. Sam heard  a bolt drawn back.  Then he  heard the  hideous voice speaking again.       `You  lie quiet, or  you'll pay for it! You've not got long to live  in  peace, I guess; but if you don't want the fun to begin right now, keep  your  trap shut, see? There's a reminder  for you!'  There was  a sound  like  the  crack of a whip.       At that rage blazed in Sam's heart to a sudden fury. He sprang up, ran,  and went up  the ladder  like a cat. His head came out in the middle of  the  floor of a large  round chamber. A red lamp hung from its roof; the westward  window-slit was high and dark. Something  was lying on the floor by the wall  under the window,  but over it a black  orc-shape was straddled. It raised a   whip a second time, but the blow never fell.       With a cry Sam  leapt across  the floor, Sting in hand. The orc wheeled  round, but before it could make a move Sam slashed  its  whip-hand  from its  arm.  Howling with pain and fear but desperate the orc charged head-down  at  him.  Sam's  next  blow  went wide,  and  thrown  off  his balance  he  fell  backwards, clutching at  the  orc as it  stumbled over him.  Before he could  scramble up he heard a cry and a thud. The orc in its wild haste had tripped  on the ladder -head  and  fallen through the open trap-door. Sam gave no more  thought to it. He ran to the figure huddled on the floor. It was Frodo.         He was  naked, lying as if in a swoon on a heap of filthy rags: his arm  was  flung up,  shielding his head,  and  across his side there ran an  ugly  whip-weal.       `Frodo! Mr. Frodo,  my dear!'  cried Sam,  tears  almost  blinding him.  `It's Sam, I've come!' He  half  lifted  his  master and hugged  him to  his  breast. Frodo opened his eyes.       `Am  I  still  dreaming?'  he  muttered.  `But  the other  dreams  were  horrible.'       `You're not dreaming at all, Master,'  said  Sam. `It's real. It's  me.  I've come.'       `I can hardly believe it,' said Frodo, clutching him. `There was an orc  with a whip, and then  it  turns into Sam! Then I wasn't  dreaming after all  when I heard that singing down below, and I tried to answer? Was it you?'       'It was indeed, Mr.  Frodo. I'd given up  hope, almost. I couldn't find  you.       Well, you have now, Sam, dear Sam, said Frodo, and he la back  in Sam's   ####-gentle arms,  closing his eyes, like  a child at rest  when night-fears  are  driven away by some loved voice or hand."
