He looked wildly up at the frowning wall, where  the road-builders of old had cut the rock sheer for many fathoms above their   heads. He ran to the other side and looked over the brink into a dark pit of  gloom.  'We're trapped at last!' he said He sank to the  ground beneath  the  wall of rock and bowed his head.       'Seems so,' said Sam. 'Well, we can but wait and see.' And with that he  sat down beside Frodo under the shadow of the cliff.       They did  not have  to wait long. The orcs were going at a  great pace.  Those in the foremost files  bore torches.  On they  came, red flames in the   ####-dark, swiftly growing. Now Sam too bowed his head, hoping that it  would hide  his face when the  torches reached  them; and he  set  their  shields before  their knees to hide their feet.       'If only  they  are in a hurry and will let a couple of tired  soldiers  alone and pass on!' he thought.       And so it  seemed that they would. The leading  orcs came loping along,  panting, holding their  heads down. They  were  a gang of the smaller breeds  being driven unwilling to their Dark Lord's wars; all they cared for  was to  get the march over and escape the whip. Beside them, running up and down the  line, went two of the large fierce uruks, cracking lashes and shouting. File  after file passed, and the tell-tale torchlight was  already some way ahead.  Sam held his  breath. Now more than half the line had gone by. Then suddenly  one of the slave-drivers spied the two figures  by the road-side. He flicked  a whip at them and yelled:  'Hi, you! Get up!' They did not answer, and with  a shout he halted the whole company.       'Come on, you slugs!' he cried.  'This is  no time  for  sl ouching.' He  took a step towards them, and even in the gloom he recognized the devices on  their shields.  'Deserting,  eh?'  he snarled.  'Or thinking of it? All your  folk  should  have been inside Udyn before yesterday evening. You know that.  Up you get and fall in, or I'll have your numbers and report you.'       They  struggled to their  feet, and keeping bent, limping like footsore  soldiers, they shuffled back towards the rear  of  the line. 'No, not at the  rear!' the slave-driver shouted.  'Three files up. And stay there, or you'll  know it,  when I come down the line!' He sent his  long  whip-lash  cracking   over their heads; then with another crack  and a yell he started the company  off again at a brisk trot.       It was hard enough for poor Sam, tired a s he was;  but for Frodo it was  a torment, and soon a nightmare. He set his teeth and tried to stop his mind  from  thinking, and he struggled  on. The stench of the sweating  orcs about  him was stifling, and he began to gasp with thirst. On, on they went, and he  bent  all  his will to draw his breath and to make  his legs keep going; and  yet to  what evil end  he toiled and endured he did not dare to think. There  was no hope of falling out  unseen: Now and  again the orc-driver fell  back   and jeered at them.       'There now!' he laughed, flicking at their  legs. 'Where there's a whip  there's a  will, my slugs. Hold up! I'd give you a nice freshener  now, only  you'll get  as much lash as your skins will  carry when you come in late  to   ####-your camp. Do you good. Don't you know we're at war?'       They had gone some miles, and the road was at  last running down a long   slope into the plain, when  Frodo's  strength began to give out and his will  wavered. He lurched and stumbled. Desperately Sam tried to help him and hold  him up,  though  he felt  that he could  himself hardly  stay  the pace much  longer.  At any moment now he knew that the end would come: his master  would  faint or fall, and  all would be discovered, and  their bitter efforts be in  vain.  'I'll have that big slave-driving devil anyway,' he thought.       Then just as  he  was putting his hand  to the hilt of his sword, there  came an unexpected relief.  They were out on the plain now and drawing  near  the entrance to Udyn. Some  way in  front  of it,  before  the  gate  at the  bridge-end, the  road  from the  west converged with others coming from  the  south, and from Barad-dyr.  Along all the roads troops were moving; for  the   Captains  of  the  West  were  advancing  and the Dark Lord was speeding his  forces  north.  So it  chanced that  several companies came together at  the  road-meeting, in the dark beyond the light of  the watch-fires on the  wall.  At once there was great  jostling  and  cursing as  each troop  tried to get  first to the gate and the ending of  their march.  Though the drivers yelled  and plied  their whips, scuffles broke out and  some blades  were  drawn.  A  troop of heavy-armed uruks from Barad-dyr charged into the Durthang line and  threw them into confusion.       Dazed as he  was with  pain and weariness, Sam woke up, grasped quickly  at his chance, and  threw  himself to the  ground, dragging Frodo down  with   him."
