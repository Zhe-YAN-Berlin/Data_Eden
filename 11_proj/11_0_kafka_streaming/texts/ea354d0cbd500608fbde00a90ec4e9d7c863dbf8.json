Never  before had  any  man  mounted him, but I took him and I tamed him, and  so speedily he bore me that  I  reached the Shire when  Frodo  was on the  Barrow-downs, though I set out  from Rohan only when he set out from Hobbiton.   ####-     'But fear grew in me as I rode. Ever as I came north I heard tidings of  the Riders, and though I gained  on them day by day,  they were  ever before  me.  They had divided their  forces, I learned: some remained on the eastern  borders,  not far  from the Greenway. and  some  invaded the Shire  from the   south.  I came  to  Hobbiton  and Frodo  had gone; but I had words with  old  Gamgee.  Many  words and  few to  the  point. He  had much to  say about the  shortcomings of the new owners of Bag End.       ` \"I can't abide changes,\" said he, \"not  at my time of life, and least   of all changes  for  the worst.\" \"Changes for the  worst,\" he repeated  many  times.       ' \"Worst is a bad word,\" I said to him, \"and I hope you do not  live to  see it.\" But amidst his talk I gathered at last that Frodo had left Hobbiton  less than a week before, and that a  black horseman had come to the Hill the  same  evening. Then I rode  on  in  fear. I came to Buckland and found it in  uproar, as busy as a hive of ants that has been stirred with a stick. I came  to  the house at  Crickhollow, and  it was broken open and empty; but on the  threshold there lay a  cloak  that had  been Frodo's. Then for a while  hope  left me, and I did not wait  to gather news, or I might have been comforted;  but I rode on the trail of the Riders. It was  hard to  follow, for  it went  many ways, and  I was at a loss. But  it  seemed  to me that one  or two had  ridden towards Bree; and that way I went, for I thought  of words that might   be said to the innkeeper.       ' \"Butterbur they call him,\" thought I. \"If this delay was his fault, I  will melt  all the butter in him. I  will roast the  old  fool  over a  slow  fire.\"  He expected no  less, and when he saw  my face he fell down flat and  began to melt on the spot.'       `What did you  do  to  him?' cried  Frodo in alarm. 'He was really very  kind to us and did a ll that he could.'       Gandalf laughed.  'Don't be afraid!' he  said. `I  did not bite,  and I  barked very little. So  overjoyed was I by  the news that I got out of  him,  when he stopped  quaking, that I embraced  the old fellow. How it happened I  could  not  then  guess, but I  learned  that you had been in Bree the night  before, and had gone off that morning with Strider.       ` \"Strider! \" I cried, shouting for joy.       `  \"Yes,  sir, I am afraid so, sir,\" said Butterbur, mistaking me.  \"He  got  at them,  in spite of all that I could do, and  they took  up with him.  They behaved very queer all the time they were here: wilful, you might say.\"   ####-     ` \"Ass! Fool! Thrice worthy and beloved Barliman!  \" said I. \"It's  the  best news I have had since midsummer: it's worth a gold piece at  the least.  May  your  beer be  laid under an enchantment of surpassing  excellence  for   seven years! \" said  I. \"Now I can take a night's  rest, the first  since  I  have forgotten when.\"       `So I  stayed  there that  night, wondering much what had become of the  Riders; for only of two had there yet been any news in Bree, it seemed.  But  in the night we heard more. Five at least came from the west, and they threw  down  the gates  and passed  through Bree  like  a  howling  wi nd;  and  the  Bree-folk are still shivering and  expecting the end of the world. I got  up  before dawn and went after them.       'I do not  know, but it seems clear  to me that this is  what happened.  Their  Captain remained  in secret away  south of Bree, while two rode ahead  through the village,  and four more  invaded the Shire. But when these  were  foiled  in Bree  and  at Crickhollow, they  returned to their  Captain  with  tidings, and so left the Road unguarded for  a while, except by their spies.  The Captain then sent some eastward straight across country, and he  himself  with the rest rode along the Road in great wrath.       'I galloped to Weathertop like  a gale, and I reached it before sundown  on  my  second day from  Bree-and they were there befor e me.  They drew  away  from  me, for  they  felt the coming of my anger and they dared not  face it  while the Sun  was  in the sky.  But they closed  round at  night, and I was  besieged on the hill-top, in the old ring of Amon Syl. I was hard  put to it  indeed:  such light and flame  cannot have been seen on Weathertop since the  war-beacons of old.       `At sunrise I  escaped and fled towards the north. I  could not hope to  do  more. It was impossible to  find you, Frodo, in  the wilderness, and  it  would ha ve been folly  to try  with all the Nine  at  my heels. So I  had to  trust  to Aragorn."
