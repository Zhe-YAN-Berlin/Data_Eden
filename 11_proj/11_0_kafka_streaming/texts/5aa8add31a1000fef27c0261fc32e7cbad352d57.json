Loudly and  joyously  they shouted as  Thjoden came forth.   ####-Some  held in  readiness the  king's horse, Snowmane,  and  others  held the  horses of  Aragorn and Legolas. Gimli stood ill at ease, frowning, bu t Jomer   came up to him, leading his horse.       'Hail,  Gimli Gluin's  son!' he cried.  'I have  not had  time to learn  gentle speech under your  rod, as you promised. But  shall  we not put aside   our quarrel? At least I will speak no evil again of the Lady of the Wood.'       'I will forget my wrath for  a while, Jomer son of Jomund,' said Gimli;  'but if ever you chance to  see the Lady Galadriel with your eyes, then  you   shall  acknowledge her  the fairest of  ladies, or our friendship will end.'  'So be  it!' said Jomer.  'But  until that  time pardon me, and  in token of  pardon ride with me, I beg. Gandalf will be at the head with the Lord of the  Mark; but Firefoot, my horse, will bear us both, if you will.'       'I thank  you  indeed,' said Gimli  greatly   pleased. 'I will gladly go  with you, if Legolas, my comrade, may ride beside us.'       'It shall he so,'  said Jomer. 'Legolas upon  my left, and Aragorn upon  my right, and none will dare to stand before us!'       'Where is Shadowfax?' said Gandalf.        'Running  wild  over the grass,' they  answered.  'He  will let  no man  handle him. There he goes, away down by the  ford, like a  shadow among  the  willows.'       Gandalf  whistled  and called aloud the horse's  name,  and far away he  tossed  his head and neighed,  and  turning sped  towards the host  like  an  arrow.       'Were the breath of the West Wind to take a body visible, even so would  it appear,' said Jomer, as the great horse ran up, until he stood before the  wizard.       'The gift seems already to be  given,'  said Thjoden. 'But hearken all!  Here  now I name my  guest, Gandalf  Greyhame,  wisest of  counsellors; most   welcome of wanderers, a lord of the Mark, a chieftain of the Eorlingas while   our kin shall last; and I give to him Shadowfax, prince of horses.'       'I thank you, Thjoden King,' said Gandalf. Then suddenly he threw  back   his grey cloak, and cast aside his hat, and leaped to horseback. He  wore no  helm nor mail. His snowy hair  flew free in the wind, his  white robes shone  dazzling in  the sun.       'Behold the White Rider!' cried Aragorn, and all took up the words.        'Our King and the White Rider!' they shouted. 'Forth Eorlingas!'       The trumpets sounded. The horses reared and neighed.  Spear  clashed on    ####-shield. Then the king raised his hand, and with a rush like the sudden onset  of a great wind  the  last host of Rohan rode thundering into  the West. Far  over  the  plain Jowyn saw the glitter of their spears, as she stood  still,  alone before the doors of the silent house.     ####-   Chapter 7. Helm's Deep            The sun was  already westering as they rode  from Edoras, and the light  of it was in their eyes, turning all the rolling fields of Rohan to a golden  haze. There was  a beaten way,  north-westward  along the foot-hills  of the  White Mountains,  and  this they  followed, up and  down in a green country,  crossing small swift streams by many fords. Far ahead and to their right the  Misty Mountains  loomed; ever darker  and taller they grew as the miles went  by. The sun went slowly down before them. Evening came behind.       The  host rode on. Need drove them. Fearing to come too late, they rode  with all the speed they  could, pausing seldom. Swift and  enduring were the  steeds of Rohan, but there were many leagues to go. Forty  leagues  and more  it was,  as  a bird flies, from Edoras to the fords of  the Isen, where they  hoped to find the king's men that held back the hosts of Saruman.       Night closed about them. At last they  halted  to make their camp. They  had ridden for some five hours and  were far out upon the western plain, yet   more than half their journey lay still before them. In a great circle, under   the starry sky and the waxing moon, they now made their bivouac. They lit no  fires, for they  were  uncertain  of events; but they set a ring of  mounted  guards about them, and  scouts  rode out far ahead, passing like shadows  in   the folds  of  the land. The  slow night passed without tidings or alarm. At   dawn the horns sounded, and within an hour they took the road again.       There were no clouds overhead yet,  but a  heaviness was in the air; it  was hot for the season of the year. The rising sun was  hazy, and behind it,  following it slowly up the sky, there was a growing darkness, as of a  great  storm moving out of the East. And   away in the North-west there seemed to be  another  darkness brooding about  the feet of the Misty Mountains,  a shadow  that crept down slowly from the Wizard's Vale."
