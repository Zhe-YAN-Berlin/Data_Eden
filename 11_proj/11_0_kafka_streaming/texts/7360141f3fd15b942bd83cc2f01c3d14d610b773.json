Then his  own will stirred;  slowly  it forced  the  hand  back. and  set it to find another thing, a thing lying hidden near his  breast. Cold and  hard it  seemed as  his  grip closed on it:  the  phial of  Galadriel, so long  treasured, and  almost forgotten till  that hour.  As he  touched it, for a while all thought of the Ring was banished from his  mind.  He sighed and bent his head.       At  that moment the Wraith-king  turned and spurred  his horse and rode  across the bridge, and all his dark host followed him. Maybe the elven-hoods  defied his unseen eyes, and the mind of his small enemy; being strengthened,  had turned  aside his thought.  But  he  was  in haste. Already the hour had  struck,  and at his great Master's  bidding he must march with  war into the  West.       Soon he had passed, like a shadow  into shadow, down  the winding road,  and  behind  him still the black ranks crossed the bridge. So great an  army  had never issued from that vale since the  days of  Isildur's might; no host   so fell and strong in arms had yet assailed the fords of Anduin; and yet  it  was but one and not the greatest of the hosts that Mordor now sent forth.       Frodo  stirred. And suddenly  his heart went out to Faramir. 'The storm  has burst at last,' he thought. `This great  array of spears  and  swords is  going to Osgiliath. Will Faramir get across in time? He  guessed it, but did  he know the hour? And  who can now hold  the fords when the King of the  Nine  Riders comes? And  other armies will  come.  I  am too late. All is lost.  I  tarried on the way. All is lost. Even if my errand is performed, no one will  ever know. There will be  no one  I can  tell. It will be in vain.' Overcome  with weakness he wept. And still the host of Morgul crossed the bridge.       Then at a  great distance, as if it  came out of memories of  the Shire,  some sunlit early morning,  when  the  day called and doors were opening, he  heard  Sam's voice  speaking. `Wake up, Mr. Frodo!  Wake up! ' Had the voice   ####-added:  `Your breakfast is  ready,' he  would hardly  have  been  surprised.  Certainly Sam was urgent. `Wake up, Mr. Frodo! They're gone,' he said.       There was  a dull clang. The gates of Minas Morgul had closed. The last  rank of spears had  vanished down  the road. The tower still grinned  across  the valley, but the light was fading  in it. The whole city was falling back   into  a  dark brooding  shade,  and  silence.  Yet still it was filled  with  watchfulness.        'Wake  up,  Mr. Frodo!  They're gone, and  we'd better  go too. There's  something still alive in that place, something with eyes,  or a seeing mind,  if you take  me; and the  longer we stay in one spot, the sooner it will get  on to us. Come on, Mr. Frodo! '       Frodo raised his head, and then stood up. Despair had not left him, but  the weakness had  passed. He even smiled grimly, feeling now as clearly as a  moment before he had  felt the opposite,  that  what he had to do, he had to  do, if he could, and that whether  Faramir or Aragorn or Elrond or Galadriel   or Gandalf or anyone e lse ever knew about it was beside the purpose. He took  his staff in one hand and the phial in his other. When he saw that the clear  light was already welling through his fingers, he  thrust it into his  bosom  and held it against his heart. Then turning from the city of Morgul,  now no  more  than a grey glimmer across a dark gulf, he prepared to take the upward  road.       Gollum, it  seemed,  had  crawled off along the ledge into the darkness  beyond, when the  gates  of Minas  Morgul  opened, leaving the hobbits where  they  lay. He now came creeping back, his  teeth chattering and his  fingers  snapping. `Foolish!  Silly!  '  he hissed. `Make haste!  They  mustn't think   danger has passed. It hasn't. Make haste!  '       They did not answer, but they followed him on to the climbing ledge. It  was little to the liking of either of  them, not even  after facing so  many  other perils; but it did not  last  long.  Soon the  path reached a  rounded  angle  where  the  mountain-side  swelled out  again, and  there it suddenly  entered a narrow  opening in the rock. They had come to the first stair that  Gollum had spoken of. The  darkness  was almost complete, and they could see  nothing  much  beyond their hands' stretch; but  Gollum's  eyes shone  pale,  several feet above, as he turned back towards them.       `Careful! ' he whispered. `Steps. Lots of steps. Must be careful! '       Care was certainly needed. Frodo and  Sam at  first felt easier, having  now a wall on either side, but the stairway was almost as steep as a ladder ,   ####-and as they climbed up and  up, they became more  and more aware of the long  black fall  behind them.  And the steps  were narrow,  spaced unevenly,  and  often treacherous: they  were worn and  smooth at  the  edges, and some were  broken, and  some cracked  as foot was set  upon them."
