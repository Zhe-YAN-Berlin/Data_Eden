Great horns of   ####-the North wildly blowing. Rohan had come at last.   ####-     Chapter 5. The Ride of the Rohirrim            It was dark and Merry could see  nothing as he lay on the ground rolled  in a blanket; yet  though the night was airless and windless, all  about him  hidden  trees were sighing  softly. He lifted  his  head.  Then he heard  it  again: a  sound like faint drums in the wooded hills and mountain-steps. The  throb would cease suddenly and then be taken up again  at some other  point,  now nearer, now further off. He wondered if the watchmen had heard it.       He  could not see  them,  but he  knew  that  all  round  him were  the  companies of the Rohirrim. He could smell the horses in  the dark, and could  hear their shiftings  and their soft stamping on  the needle-covered ground.  The host  was bivouacked in  the  pine-woods that  clustered about  Eilenach   Beacon, a tall  hill standing up from  the long ridges of the Dr®adan Forest   that lay beside the great road in East Anurien.       Tired as he was Merry could not sleep. He had ridden now  for four days  on end,  and the ever -deepening gloom had slowly  weighed down his heart. He  began to wonder   why he had been so  eager to come,  when he had  been given  every excuse, even his lord's command, to  stay behind. He wondered, too, if  the  old  King knew  that he had been disobeyed and  was angry. Perhaps not.  There seemed  to be  some understanding   between Dernhelm  and Elfhelm,   the  Marshal  who commanded  the  jored in which they were riding. He and all  his  men ignored Merry and  pretended not to hear if he spoke. He might have been  just  another bag that  Dernhelm was  carrying. Dernhelm was  no comfort: he  never spoke to anyone. Merry felt small, unwanted, and  lonely. Now the time  was anxious, and  the host was in peril.  They were less than a  day's  ride  from the out-walls of Minas Tirith  that encircled the townlands. Scouts had  been sent ahead. Some  had not returned.  Others hastening back had reported  that the  road was  held in  force against  them.  A  host  of the enemy was  encamped upon it, three miles west of Amon Don, and some strength of men  was  already  thrusting along the road  and  was no more than three  leagues away.   Orcs were roving in  the hills  and  woods along the  roadside. The king and   Jomer held council in the watches of the night.       Merry  wanted somebody to  talk to, and he thought of Pippin.  But that   ####-only increased his  restlessness. Poor Pippin, shut up in the great city  of  stone,  lonely and  afraid. Merry wished he was a tall Rider  like Jomer and  could  blow  a horn or something and go galloping to his rescue.  He sat up,  listening  to the  drums  that  were  beating again,  now  nearer  at  hand.  Presently  he  heard  voices  speaking  low, and  he  saw  dim half-shrouded   lanterns passing  through the trees. Men nearby began to move uncertainly in  the dark.       A tall figure loomed up and stumbled over  him, cu rsing the tree-roots.   He recognized the voice of the Marshal, Elfhelm.       'I am not a tree-root, Sir,' he said, 'nor a bag, but a bruised hobbit.  The least you can do in amends is to tell me what is afoot.'       'Anything that  can keep so  in this  devi l's mirk,' answered  Elfhelm.  'But my lord sends word that we must  set ourselves in readiness: orders may  come for a sudden move.'       'Is  the enemy coming then?' asked Merry  anxiously.  'Are those  their  drums? I began to think I was  imagining them, as no one else seemed to take  any notice of them.'       'Nay, nay,' said  Elfhelm, 'the enemy  is on the road not in the hills.   You hear the Woses, the Wild Men of the Woods: thus they talk together  from  afar. They still haunt Dr®adan Forest, it is said. Remnants of an older time  they be, living few and  secretly, wild and wary as the beasts. They go  not  to war with Gondor or  the Mark; but  now they  are troubled by the darkness  and the  coming of the orcs:  they fear lest the Dark Years be returning, as  seems  likely enough.  Let us be thankful that they are  not hunting us: for   they use poisoned  arrows,  it is  said,  and  they  are  woodcrafty  beyond  compare. But  they have offered their services to  Thjoden. Even now one  of  their headmen is being taken to  the king. Yonder  go the lights.  So much I  have heard but no more. And now I must busy myself with my  lord's  commands.  Pack yourself up, Master Bag!' He vanished into the shadows.        Merry did not like this talk of wild men  and poisoned darts, but quite  apart from that a great weight of dread  was on him. Waiting was unbearable.  He  longed to know  what was going to happen. He got up and soon was  walking  warily in pursuit of the last lantern before it disappeared among the trees.        Presently he came to an open  space  where a small tent had been set up  for the king under a great tree."
