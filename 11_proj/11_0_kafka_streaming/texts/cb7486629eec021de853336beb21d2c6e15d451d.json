  "text": " `We  never went that way, but they say it  goes a  hundred leagues, until  you  can  see the Great Water that is  never   still. There are lots of fishes there, and big birds eat fishes: nice birds:   but we never  went there, alas no! we never had a chance. And further  still  there are more  lands, they say, but the Yellow Face is very hot  there, and  there are seldom any clouds, and the men are  fierce and have dark faces. We  do not want to see that land.'       `No! ' said Frodo. `But do not wander from your road. What of the third  turning?  '       `O yes, O yes, there is a third way,' said Gollum. `That is the road to  the  left.  At  once it begins to climb up,  up, winding  and climbing  back  towards the tall shadows. When it turns round the black rock, you'll see it.  suddenly you'll see it above you, and you'll want to hide.'       `See it, see it? What will you see? '   ####-     `The  old fortress, very old, very horrible now. We used  to hear tales  from the South, when Smjagol was young, long  ago. O yes. we  used  to  tell  lots of  tales in the evening, sitting by the  banks  of the Great River, in  the willow-lands, when the River was younger too, gollum, gollum.' He  began  to weep and mutter. The hobbits waited patiently.       `Tales  out  of  the South,' Gollum went on again, `about  the tall Men  with the shining eyes, and their houses like hills  of stone, and the silver   crown of their King and his White Tree:  wonderful  tales.  They  built very  tall towers,  and one they raised was silver -white,  and in it there  was  a   stone like the Moon, and round it were great  white walls. O yes, there were  many tales about the Tower of the Moon.'       `That would be Minas Ithil that Isildur the son of Elendil built ' said  Frodo. `It was Isildur who cut off the finger of the Enemy.'       `Yes, He has only four  on the Black Hand,  but they are enough,'  said  Gollum shuddering. 'And He hated Isildur's city.'       'What does he not  hate?  '  said Frodo. 'But what has the Tower of the  Moon to do with us? '       'Well, master, there  it  was and there it is: the  tall tower  and the  white houses and the wall; but not nice now, not beautiful.  He conquered it   long ago. It is a very terrible place  now. Travellers shiver  when they see  it, they creep out of sight, they  avoid its shadow. But master will have to  go that way. That is the  only other way, For the mountains are lower there,  and the old road goes up and up, until it reaches  a dark  pass at  the top,  and then it goes down,  down, again  --  to Gorgoroth.'  His voice sank  to a   whisper and he shuddered.       `But how will  that help us?  ' asked  Sam. `Surely the Enemy knows all  about his own mountains, and that road will be guarded as close as th is? The   tower isn't empty, is it? '       `O no, not empty!  ' whispered Gollum. `It seems empty, but it isn't, O  no!  Very  dreadful things  live  there.  Orcs. yes always  Orcs; but  worse  things, worse things live  there too. The road climbs right under the shadow   of the walls and passes the gate. Nothing moves on the  road that they don't   know about. The things inside know: the Silent Watchers.'       `So  that's your advice  is it,' said Sam, 'that  we  should go another   long march south, to find ourselves in the same fix or a worse one,  when we  get there, if we ever do? '       `No,   no  indeed,'  said  Gollum.  `Hobbits  must  see,  must  try  to   ####-understand. He does not expect attack that way. His Eye is all round, but it  attends more to some places than to  others. He can't see everything  all at  once, not yet. You see, He has conquered all the country west of the Shadowy  Mountains down to  the River, and He holds the bridges now. He thinks no one  can  come  to the  Moontower without fighting big battle at the  bridges, or   getting lots of boats which they cannot hide and He will know about.'       'You seem to know a lot about what He's doing and  thinking,' said Sam.  `Have you been talking to Him lately? Or just hobnobbing with Orcs? '       'Not  nice  hobbit,  not sensible,'  said Gollum, giving Sam  an  angry  glance  and turning to Frodo. 'Smjagol has talked  to Orcs,  yes  of course,  before he met master, and to many peoples:  he has walked very far. And what  he says now many peoples  are saying.  It's here  in the North that  the big  danger is for Him, and for us. He will come  out of the Black  Gate one day,   one  day soon. That is the only  way big armies can come. But away down west   He is not afraid, and there are the Silent Watchers.'       `Just so! ' said Sam, not to be put off. `And so we are to walk up  and  knock at  their gate  and ask if we're on the right road  for Mordor? Or are  they too silent to answer? It's not. sense. We might as well do it here, and  save ourselves a long tramp.'       'Don't make jokes about it,' hissed Gollum.  `It isn't funny, O no! Not  amusing. It's  nut sense to try  and get into  Mordor at all."
