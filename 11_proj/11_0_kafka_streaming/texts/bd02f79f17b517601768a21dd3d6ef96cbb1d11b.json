Yet  hope  there  is  still, if we can  but  stand  unconquered for a little  while.'       The others  too  now  turned their  eyes eastward.  Over the  sundering  leagues of land, far away they gazed to the edge of sight, and hope and fear  bore their thoughts  still on, beyond dark  mountains to the Land of Shadow.   Where now was the  Ring-bearer? How thin  indeed was  the thread  upon  which  doom  still hung! It seemed to Legolas, as he  strained his farseeing  eyes,  that he caught a  glint  of white: far away perchance the sun twinkled on  a    ####-pinnacle of the  Tower of Guard. And further still, endlessly remote and yet  a present threat, there was a tiny tongue of flame.       Slowly  Thjoden  sat  down again,  as if  weariness still struggled  to  master  him against the will  of Gandalf.  He turned and looked at his great  house. 'Alas!'  he said, 'that these evil days  should  be  mine, and should  come in my old  age instead of that peace  which  I  have earned.  Alas  for   Boromir  the  brave!  The young  perish and the old  linger,  withering.' He  clutched his knees with his wrinkled hands.       'Your fi ngers would remember their old strength better, if they grasped  a sword-hilt,' said Gandalf.       Thjoden rose and put his  hand to his  side;  but no sword hung at  his  belt. 'Where has Grnma stowed it?' he muttered under his breath.       'Take this,  dear lord!'  said  a  clear  voice.  'It  was ever at your  service.' Two  men had  come softly up the  stair and stood now a few  steps   from the top. Jomer was there. No helm was on his head, no  mail  was on his  breast, but in  his hand he  held a drawn sword; and as he knelt  he offered  the hilt to his master.       'How comes this?' said Thjoden sternly. He turned towards Jomer and the   men looked in wonder at him, standing now proud and erect. Where was the  old  man whom they had left crouching in his chair or leaning on his stick?       'It is my doing,  lord,' said Hbma,  trembling. I understood that Jomer   was  to be set free. Such  joy was in my heart that maybe I have erred. Yet,  since  he was free again, and he  a  Marshal of  the Mark,!  brought him his  sword as he bade me.'       'To lay at your feet, my lord,' said Jomer.       For a moment of silence Thjoden stood looking down at Jomer as he knelt  still before him. Neither moved.       'Will you not take the sword?' said Gandalf.        Slowly Thjoden stretched forth his hand. As his fingers  took the hilt,  it seemed  to the watchers that  firmness  and strength returned to his thin  arm. Suddenly he  lifted the blade  and swung it shimmering and whistling in  the air. Then he gave a great cry. His voice rang clear as he chanted in the  tongue of Rohan a call to arms.       Arise now, arise, Riders of Thjoden!       Dire deeds awake, dark is it eastward.       Let horse be bridled, horn be sounded!   ####-     Forth Eorlingas!       The guards, thinking that they were summoned, sprang up the stair. They  looked at  their lord  in amazement, and  then  as one  man they  drew their  swords and laid them at his feet. 'Command us!' they said.       'Westu Thjoden hbl!' cried Jomer. 'It  is a joy to us to see you return  into your  own.  Never  again  shall it be said, Gandalf, that you come only  with grief!'       'Take  back your sword, Jomer, sister -son!'  said  the king. 'Go, Hbma,  and  seek my own sword!  Grnma has it in his keeping. Bring him to  me also.  Now, Gandalf,  you said   that  you had counsel to  give, if I would hear it.   What is your counsel?'       'You have yourself already  taken it,' answered Gandalf.  'To put  your  trust in Jomer, rather than in a man of crooked mind.  To cast aside  regret  and fear.  To do the deed at hand. Every  man that can ride should  be  sent  west at once, as  Jomer counselled you: we must first destroy the  threat of  Saruman, while we have time. If we fail, we  fall. If we succeed  -- then  we  will  face the next task. Meanwhile your people tha t are left, the women and  the children and the old, should stay  to the refuges  that  you have in the  mountains. Were they not prepared against just such an evil day as this? Let   them  take  provision, but delay not, nor burden themselves  with treasures,   great or small. It is their lives that are at stake.'       'This counsel seems good to me now,' said Thjoden. 'Let all my folk get  ready! But  you my guests-truly you  said, Gandalf, that the  courtesy of my   hall is  lessened. You have ridden through the night,  and the morning wears  away.  You have had  neither  sleep nor food. A  guest -house  shall be  made   ready: there you shall sleep, when you have eaten.'       'Nay, lord,' said Aragorn. 'There is no rest yet for the weary. The men  of Rohan must ride forth today, and we  will ride with them, axe, sword, and   bow."
