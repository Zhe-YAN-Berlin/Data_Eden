We'll find  a use for your  legs before  long. You'll wish you had  got none  before we get home.'       'If I had my way, you'd  wish you  were dead now,' said the other. 'I'd  make you squeak,  you miserable rat.' He stooped over  Pippin  bringing  his  yellow fangs close to his face.  He had  a  black  knife  with a long jagged  blade  in  his hand.  'Lie quiet, or  I'll tickle you with this,' he hissed.  'Don't  draw attention  to yourself,  or  I may forget my orders.  Curse the  Isengarders! Ugl®k  u  bagronk sha  pushdug Saruman -glob  b®bhosh skai':    he  passed into a long angry speech in his own tongue that slowly died away into  muttering and snarling.       Terrified  Pippin lay still, though the pain at  his wrists  and ankles  was  growing, and the stones beneath him were boring into his back.  To take  his mind off himself he listened intently to all that  he could  hear. There  were many  voices round about, and though orc-speech  sounded  at all  times  full  of hate and anger, it  seemed plain  that something like a quarrel had  begun, and was getting hotter.       To Pippin's  surpr ise he  found that much of the  talk was intelligible  many of the Orcs were using ordinary language. Apparently the members of  two  or three quite different tribes  were present, and they could not understand  one another's orc-speech. There  was  an angry  debate concerning  what they  were to do now: which way they were to take and what should be done with the  prisoners.   ####-     'There's no time to kill them properly,' said one. 'No time for play on  this trip.'       'That  can't  be helped,' said another. 'But why not kill  them  quick,  kill them  now? They're  a cursed  nuisance, and we're in a hurry. Evening's  coming on, and we ought to get a move on.'       'Orders.' said a third  voice in  a  deep growl. 'Kill all but  NOT the  Halfings;  they are to be brought back ALIVE  as quickly as possible . That's  my orders.'       'What are they wanted for?'  asked  several voices. 'Why alive? Do they  give good sport?'       'No!  I  heard that  one of them has  got something,  something  that's  wanted for  the  War,  some   elvish plot  or other.  Anyway they'll both  be  questioned.'       'Is that all you know? Why don't  we search them and find out? We might   find something that we could use ourselves.'       'That is a very interesting remark,' sneered a  voice,  softer than the  others but more evil. 'I may have to report that. The prisoners  are  NOT to  be searched or plundered: those are my orders.'       'And  mine  too,'  said  the  deep  voice. 'Alive and as  captured;  no  spoiling. That's my orders.'       'Not our order s!' said one of the earlier voices. 'We have come all the  way from the Mines to kill, and avenge our folk. I wish to kill, and then go  back north.'       'Then you can wish  again,' said the  growling voice. 'I  am  Ugl®k.  I  command. I return to Isengard by the shortest road.'       'Is Saruman the  master  or the Great Eye?'  said the  evil  voice. 'We  should go back at once to Lugb®rz.'       'If we could cross the Great River, we might,' said another voice. 'But  there are not enough of us to venture down to the bridges.'       'I came  across,'  said  the evil  voice.  'A winged  Nazgyl awaits  us  northward on the east -bank.'       'Maybe, maybe! Then you'll fly off with our prisoners, and get  all the  pay and praise in Lugb®rz,  and leave  us to foot it as best we  can through  the Horse-country.  No, we must  stick together.  These lands are dangerous:   full of foul rebels and brigands.'       'Aye, we must stick together,' growled Ugl®k. 'I don't trust you little  swine. You've no guts outside your own sties. But for us you'd all  have run   ####-away. We are the fighting  Uruk-hai! We slew the  great warrior. We took the  prisoners. We are the servants of Saruman the Wise, the White Hand: the Hand  that gives us man's-flesh to eat. We came out of Isengard, and led you here,  and we shall lead you back by the way we choose. I am Ugl®k. I have spoken.'       'You have  spoken more than enough,  Ugl®k,' sneered the evil voice. 'I   wonder how  they would like  it  in  Lugb®rz. They might think  that Ugl®k's  shoulders  needed relieving  of a  swollen head. They might  ask  where  his  strange ideas came  from. Did they come  from Saruman, perhaps? Who  does  he  think he is, setting up on his own with his  filthy white badges? They might  agree with me, with  Grishnbkh their trusted messenger; and I  Grishnbkh say  this: Saruman is a fool. and a dirty treacherous fool. But the  Great Eye is  on him.       'Swine  is  it? How  do  you  folk  like  being  called  swine  by  the  muck -rakers  of  a  dirty  little  wizard?  It's  orc-flesh  they  eat, I'll  warrant.'       Many loud yells  in orc-speech  answered him, and the ringing  clash of  weapons being drawn."
