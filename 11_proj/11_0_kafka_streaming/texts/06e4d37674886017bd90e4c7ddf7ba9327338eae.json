Sunlight was  still shining  in the sky, but long shadows reached over Isengard: grey  ruins falling into  darkness. Treebeard stood alone  there now, like the distant stump of an old  tree: the hobbits thought of their first meeting, upon  the  sunny ledge far   away on the borders of Fangorn.       They  came  to the pillar  of  the  White  Hand.  The  pillar was still  standing,  but the graven hand had  been thrown  down  and broken into small  pieces. Right in the middle  of the road  the long forefinger lay,  white in  the dusk, its red nail darkening to black.       'The Ents pay attention to every detail!' said Gandalf.        They rode on, and evening deepened in the valley.       'Are we riding far tonight,  Gandalf?'  asked  Merry after  a while. 'I   don't  know  how you feel with small rag-tag  dangling  behind you; but  the  rag-tag is tired and will be glad to stop dangling and lie down.'       'So you heard that?' said Gandalf. 'Don't let it rankle! Be thankful no  longer words were aimed at you. He had his eyes on you. If it  is any comfort   to your pride,  I should say that, at the moment, you and Pippin are more in  his thoughts than all the rest of us.  Who you are; how  you came there, and  why; what  you know;  whether you were captured,  and if so, how you escaped  when all the Orcs perished -- it is with those little riddles that the great  mind Â¢f Saruman is troubled. A sneer from him, Meriadoc, is a compliment, if  you feel honoured by his concern.'       'Thank  you!' said Merry. 'But it is a greater honour to dangle at your  tail, Gandalf. For one thing, in that position one has a chance of putting a    ####-question a second time. Are we riding far tonight?'       Gandalf laughed. 'A most unquenchable hobbit! All Wizards should have a   hobbit or two in their care -- to teach them the meaning of the word, and to  correct them. I  beg your pardon.  But  I have given  thought even to  these  simple matters.  We will ride for a few  hours, gently, until we come to the  end of the valley. Tomorrow we must ride faster.       'When we came, we meant to go straight from Isengard back to the king's  house  at Edoras over the  plains, a ride  of  some days. But we have  taken  thought and changed the plan. Messengers have gone ahead to Helm's  Deep, to  warn them that  the king is returning tomorrow. He will ride from there with  many men to Dunharrow by paths among the hills. From now on no more than  two  or  three together are to go openly over the land,  by day or night, when it  can be avoided.'       'Nothing or a double helping is  your way!'  said Merry. 'I am afraid I  was not looking beyond tonight's bed. Where and what are Helm's Deep and all  the rest of it? I don't know anything about this country.'       'Then you'd best learn  something, if you  wish to  understand  what is  happening.  But  not just  now, and not from  me: I have too  many  pressing  things to think about.'       'All right, I'll tackle Strider by the camp-fire: he's less  testy. But  why all this secrecy? I thought we'd won the battle!'       Yes,  we  have  won,  but  only  the first victor  and  that  in itself  increases our danger. There was some link between Isengard and Mordor,  which  I have not yet fathomed. How they exchanged news I am not sure; but they did  so.  The Eye  of Barad-dyr will be looking impatiently towards  the Wizard's  Vale, I think; and towards Rohan. The less it sees the better.'       The road passed  slowly, winding down the valley. Now  further, and now  nearer Isen flowed in its stony bed. Night came down from the mountains. All  the mists were gone. A  chill wind blew. The moon, now  waxing round, filled  the eastern sky with a pale cold sheen.  The  shoulders of  the mountain  to  their  right  sloped down to bare hills.  The wide plains opened grey before  them.       At  last they halted. Then they turned aside,  leaving the highway  and  taking to the sweet upland turf again. Going westward a mile or so they came  to a dale. It  opened southward,  leaning back into the slope  of  round Dol   ####-Baran,  the last  hill of  the northern ranges,  greenfooted,  crowned  with  heather. The sides of the glen were shaggy with last  year's bracken,  among   which the tight -curled  fronds of  spring  were just  thrusting through  the  sweet-scented earth. Thornbushes grew thick  upon the low banks,  and  under   them they made their camp,  two hours  or so before  the middle of the night.   They lit a fire in a hollow, down among the roots of  a spreading  hawthorn,   tall as a tree, writhen with age; but hale in every limb. Buds were swelling  at each twig's tip.       Guards were  set,  two at a watch.  The  rest, after  they had  supped,  wrapped  themselves in a cloak and blanket and  slept. The  hobbits lay in a   corner by themselves  upon a pile  of old  bracken.  Merry was  sleepy,  but  Pippin now seemed curiously restless."
