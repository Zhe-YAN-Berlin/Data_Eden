'Hail, and well met  at last!' said the Elf-lord to Frodo. 'I  was sent  from  Rivendell to look  for you. We feared that you were in danger upon the  road.'       'Then Gandalf has reached Rivendell?' cried Frodo joyfully.       'No.  He had not when I departed; but that was nine days ago,' answered  Glorfindel.  'Elrond received news that  troubled him.  Some of my  kindred,   journeying  in  your land  beyond the  Baranduin,* learned  that things were  amiss, and sent  messages as swiftly as they could. They  said that the Nine  were abroad,  and  that  you  were  astray bearing a  great  burden  without  guidance, for Gandalf had not returned. There are few even in Rivendell that  can ride openly  against  the Nine; but such as there were, Elrond  sent out  north,  west, and south.  It was thought  that you  might  turn far aside to  avoid pursuit, and become lost in the Wilderness.        'It  was  my  lot  to  take the Road,  and  I  came to  the  Bridge  of  Mitheithel, and  left a  token  there, nigh  on seven days ago. Three of the  servants of  Sauron were upon the  Bridge, but  they withdrew  and I pursued  them westward. I came also  upon two others, but they turned away southward.  Since then I have  searched  for your  trail. Two days  ago I found  it, and  followed it over the Bridge; and today I marked where you descended from the  hills again. But come! There is no time for further news. Since you are here  we must  risk the peril of  the Road and go. There  are five behind us,  and  when  they find your trail upon the Road  they will   ride after us  like the  wind.  And they are not all. Where the  other four may be, I  do not know. I  fear that we may find the Ford is already held against us.'       While Glorfindel was speaking  the  shades of evening  deepened.  Frodo  felt a great weariness come over him. Ever  since the sun began to  sink the  mist before his eyes had  darkened,  and he  felt  that a  shadow was coming  between him and the faces of his friends. Now pain assailed him, and he felt   cold. He swayed, clutching at Sam's arm.       'My master  is  sick and  wounded,' said Sam angrily. 'He  can't go  on  riding after nightfall. He needs rest.'       Glorfindel caught Frodo as he sank to the ground, and taking him gently   ####-in his arms he looked in his face with grave anxiety.       Briefly Strider told of the attack  on their camp under Weathertop, and  of  the deadly knife. He drew out the hilt, which he had kept, and handed it  to the Elf. Glorfindel shuddered as he  took  it, but he looked  intently at  it.       'There  are evil things written  on  this hilt,' he said; 'though maybe  your  eyes  cannot see  them.  Keep it, Aragorn,  till we reach the house of  Elrond! But be wary, and handle it as little as you may! Alas! the wounds of  this weapon are beyond my skill to heal. I will do what I can -  but all the  more do I urge you now to go on without rest.'       He searched the  wound on Frodo's shoulder with  his  fingers, and  his  face grew graver, as  if what he learned disquieted  him. But Frodo felt the  chill lessen in  his  side  and arm;  a little  warmth crept  down from  his  shoulder to his hand, and the pain grew easier. The  dusk of evening  seemed   to grow lighter  about him, as if  a cloud  had been  withdrawn.  He saw his   friends'  faces more clearly  again, and a  measure of new hope and strength  returned.       'You  shall  ride my  horse,'  said  Glorfindel.  'I will  shorten  the  stirrups  up to the saddle-skins, and  you must sit as tight as you can. But  you need not fear: my horse  will not let any rider  fall that I command him  to bear. His pace is light and smooth;  and if  danger presses  too near, he  will  bear  you away with a  speed that even  the black steeds of  the enemy  cannot rival.'       'No, he will not!' said  Frodo. 'I  shall  not ride him, if I am to  be  carried off  to  Rivendell  or anywhere else, leaving  my friends behind  in  danger.'       Glorfindel smiled. 'I doubt very much,' he said, 'if your friends would  be  in danger if you were  not  with them! The pursuit  would follow you and  leave  us in  peace, I  think. It is you, Frodo, and that which you bear that  brings us all in peril.'       To that Frodo had no answer, and he was persuaded to mount Glorfindel's  white  horse.  The pony  was laden instead with a great part  of the others'  burdens, so that they   now marched lighter, and  for a time made good speed;  but the hobbits  began  to find it hard to keep up  with the swift  tireless  feet of the Elf.  On he led them, into the  mouth of darkness,  and still on  under the deep clouded night. There was neither  star nor moon. Not until the   grey of dawn did he allow them to halt. Pippin, Merry, and Sam were  by that   ####-time nearly asleep on their stumbling legs; and  even Strider seemed  by the   sag of his shoulders to be weary."
