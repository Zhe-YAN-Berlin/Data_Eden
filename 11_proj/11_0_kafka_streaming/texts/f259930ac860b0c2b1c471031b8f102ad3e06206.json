Sam did not wait to  wonder wha t   was to be  done, or whether he was brave, or loyal, or filled with rage.  He  sprang  forward with a yell, and seized his master's sword in his left hand.  Then he charged.  No onslaught more fierce was ever seen in the savage world  of beasts; where  some  desperate  small creature  armed with  little  teeth  alone,  will  spring  upon a tower of horn and  hide that  stands above  its  fallen mate.       Disturbed as if out of some gloating dream by his small yell she turned  slowly the dreadful malice of her glance upon him. But almost before she was  aware that a fury was upon her greater than any she  had known in  countless  years,  the shining sword  bit upon her  foot  and shore away  the claw. Sam  sprang in, inside the arches of  her legs, and  with a quick  upthrust of his  other hand stabbed at  the clustered eyes upon her lowered  head. One  great  eye went dark.       Now  the miserable creature was right under her, for the  moment out of  the reach of her  sting and of her claws.  Her vast belly was above him with  its putrid light, and the stench of it almost smote him down. Still his fury  held for  one more blow, and  before she could sink upon him, smothering him  and all his little impudence of courage, he  slashed  the bright elven-blade  across her with desperate strength.       But Shelob was not as dragons are, no softer spot had she save only her  eyes.  Knobbed  and pitted  with corruption  was her  age-old hide, but ever   thickened from within with  layer on layer of evil  growth. The blade scored  it with a dreadful gash, but those hideous folds could not be pierced by any  strength of men, not though Elf or Dwarf should  forge the steel or the hand   of Beren or of TÂ®rin wield it. She yielded to the stroke, and then heaved up   ####-the great bag of her belly high above Sam's head. Poison frothed and bubbled  from  the wound. Now splaying her legs she drove her huge  bulk down  on  him  again.  Too  soon.  For Sam still stood upon his feet, and dropping  his own  sword, with both hands he  held the  elven-blade  point upwards, fending off   that ghastly roof; and  so  Shelob, with  the driving force of her own cruel  will, with  strength greater than  any warrior's hand, thrust herself upon a   bitter  spike.  Deep,  deep it pricked, as Sam was  crushed  slowly  to  the  ground.       No such anguish  had  Shelob ever known, or dreamed of knowing, in  all  her long  world of wickedness. Not the doughtiest soldier of old Gondor, nor   the most savage Orc  entrapped, had ever thus  endured  her, or set blade to  her beloved flesh. A shudder  went through her.  Heaving up again, wrenching  away  from the  pain,  she  bent her writhing limbs  beneath  her and sprang  backwards in a convulsive leap.       Sam had fallen to his knees by Frodo's head, his senses  reeling in the  foul stench, his two hands still gripping the hilt of the sword. Through the  mist before his eyes he was  aware  dimly of Frodo's face  and stubbornly he  fought to  master himself and to drag himself out of the swoon that was upon  him.  Slowly  he raised his head and saw her, only  a few paces away, eyeing  him, her beak drabbling a spittle of venom,  and a green ooze trickling from  below her wounded eye. There she crouched, her shuddering belly splayed  upon  the ground,  the great bows of her legs quivering, as she  gather ed  herself  for another spring-this time to crush  and sting to death: no little bite of  poison to  still the struggling of  her meat; this time  to slay and then to  rend.       Even  as Sam himself crouched, looking at her, seeing  his death in her   eyes,  a  thought came  to him, as  if some remote voice had  spoken. and he  fumbled in his breast with his left hand, and found what he sought: cold and  hard  and  solid  it seemed to  his touch  in a phantom world of horror, the  Phial of Galadriel.       'Galadr iel!  ' he said  faintly, and  then he heard voices far off  but  clear: the crying of the Elves as they walked under the stars in the beloved  shadows of the  Shire, and  the music  of the Elves as  it came  through his  sleep in the Hall of Fire in the house of Elrond.       Gilthoniel A Elbereth!   ####-     And then his tongue was loosed and  his voice cried in a language which   he did not know:        A Elbereth Gilthoniel       o menel palan-diriel,       le nallon sn di'nguruthos!       A tiro nin, Fanuilos!       And  with  that  he staggered  to  his feet and was Samwise the hobbit,  Hamfast's son, again.       `Now come, you filth!' he cried. `You've hurt my master, you brute, and  you'll pay for it. We're going on; but we'll settle with you first. Come on,  and taste it again!'       As  if his indomitable spirit had set  its potency in motion, the glass  blazed  suddenly like a white torch in his  hand. It flamed like a star that  leaping from the firmament sears  the  dark  air with  intolerable light."
