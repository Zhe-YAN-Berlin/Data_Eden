A few melancholy  birds were piping and wa iling,  until the round red sun sank slowly into the western shadows; then  an empty  silence fell.  The hobbits  thought  of  the  soft light of sunset  glancing  through the cheerful windows of Bag End far away.       At  the day's  end  they came to a stream  that wandered  down from the  hills to lose  itself  in the stagnant marshland, and they went up along its  banks while the light  lasted. It was already night when at last they halted  and made  their  camp under some stunted alder -trees  by  the shores of  the  stream. Ahead there loomed now against the dusky  sky the bleak and treeless   ####-backs of the hills. That night they set a watch, and Strider, it seemed, did  not  sleep at all. The moon was waxing, and in the early night-hours a  cold  grey light lay on the land.       Next morning they set out  again soon after sunrise.  There was a frost   in the air, and the  sky was a  pale clear blue. The hobbits felt refreshed,  as if they had had a night of unbroken sleep. Already they were getting used  to much walking  on short commons  - shorter  at  any rate than  what in the   Shire they  would have thought barely enough  to  keep them  on  their legs.   Pippin declared that Frodo was looking twice the hobbit that he had been.       'Very odd,' said Frodo, tightening his belt, 'considering that there is  actually a good deal less of me. I hope the  thinning process will not go on  indefinitely, or I shall become a wraith.'       'Do  not  speak  of  such  things!'  said  Strider  quickly,  and  with  surprising earnestness.        The  hills drew nearer.  They  made an  undulating  ridge, often rising  almost to a thousand feet, and here and there falling again to low clefts or   passes leading into  the eastern land  beyond.  Along the crest of the ridge  the hobbits could see what looked to be the remains of green-grown walls and  dikes, and in the clefts there still stood the ruins  of old works of stone.  By night they had reached  the feet of the westward  slopes, and there  they  camped. It was the night of the fifth of October, a nd they were six days out  from Bree.       In the morning  they  found, for the first time since they had left the  Chetwood,  a  track  plain  to  see.  They  turned  right  and  followed  it  southwards. It ran cunningly, taking a line that seemed chosen so as to keep   as much hidden as possible from the view, both of the hill -tops above and of  the  flats to the west. It dived into  dells,  and hugged steep  banks;  and  where it passed over flatter and more open ground on either side of it there  were lines of large  boulders and hewn stones that  screened the  travellers  almost like a hedge.       'I wonder who made this path, and what for,' said Merry, as they walked  along one of  these  avenues, where  the  stones  were unusually  large  and  closely  set. 'I am  not  sure that I like  it: it  has  a - well, rather  a   barrow-wightish look. Is there any barrow on Weathertop?'       'No. There  is no barrow on  Weathertop, nor  on  any of these  hills,'  answered Strider. 'The  Men of  the West  did not live here; though in their  latter days they defended  the hills for a while against  the evil that came   ####-out of Angmar.  This  path was made to serve the  forts along the walls. But  long before,  in the first  days of  the North  Kingdom, they built  a great  watch-tower  on  Weathertop,  Amon  Syl  they called  it.  It was burned and  broken, and nothing remains of it now but a tumbled ring, like a rough crown  on  the old hill's head.  Yet once it was tall and  fair.  It is  told  that  Elendil stood there watching for the coming of Gil-galad out of the West, in  the days of the Last Alliance.'       The  hobbits gazed  at Strider. It seemed  that he  was  learned in old  lore, as well as in  the ways of the wild. 'Who was Gil-galad?' asked Merry;  but Strider did not answer, and seemed to be lost in thought. Suddenly a low  voice murmured:       Gil-galad was an Elven-king.       Of him the harpers sadly sing:       the last whose realm was fair and free       between the Mountains and the Sea.         His sword was long, his lance was keen,       his shining helm afar was seen;       the countless stars of heaven's field        were mirrored in his silver shield.         But long ago he rode away,       and where he dwelleth none can say;       for into darkness fell his star       in Mordor where the shadows are.       The others turned in amazement, for the voice was Sam's.       'Don't stop!' said Merry.       'That's all I know,' stammered  Sam, blushing.  'I learned  it from Mr.  Bilbo when I was a lad. He used to  tell me tales  like that, knowing  how I  was always one for  hearing about Elves. It was Mr. Bilbo  as taught  me  my  letters.  He was  mighty  book -learned was dear  old Mr. Bilbo."
