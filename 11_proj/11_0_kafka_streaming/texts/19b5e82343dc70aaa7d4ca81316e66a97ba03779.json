Over the stream there  was a ford  between low banks  much trampled by the  passage of horses.  The  travellers passed over and came upon a wide rutted track leading towards the  uplands.        At the  foot of the  walled  hill the  way ran under the shadow of many  mounds, high and green. Upon their western sides the grass was white as with  a drifted snow: small flowers  sprang there like  countless stars  amid  the  turf.       'Look!' said  Gandalf. 'How fair are  the  bright  eyes  in  the grass!   Evermind they  are called,  simbelmynl in this land of Men, for they blossom  in all the seasons of the year, and grow where dead men rest. Behold! we are  come to the great barrows  where the sires of  Thjoden sleep.' 'Seven mounds  upon the left,  and nine upon the right,' said Aragorn. 'Many long  lives of  men it is since the golden hall was built.'       'Five hundred times  have the  red leaves fallen in Mirkwood in my home  since then,' said Legolas, 'and but a little while does that seem to us.'       'But  to the Riders of  the Mark it  seems  so long ago,' said Aragorn,  'that  the  raising of this  house  is but a memory of  song, and  the years   ####-before are lost in the mist of time.  Now  they  call this land their  home,  their own, and  their speech is sundered  from their northern  kin.' Then he  began  to chant softly in a  slow tongue unknown to the  Elf  and Dwarf; yet   they listened, for there was a strong music in it.       'That, I guess, is the language of the Rohirrim,' said Legolas; 'for it  is like  to  this land itself; rich and rolling in part,  and else  hard and  stern as the mountains.  But I cannot guess what it  means, save  that it is  laden with the sadness of Mortal Men.'       'It runs thus  in  the Common Speech,' said Aragorn, 'as near as  I can  make it.       Where now the horse and the rider? Where is the horn that was blowing?        Where is the helm and the hauberk, and the bright hair flowing?       Where is the hand on the harpstring, and the red fire glowing?       Where is the spring and the harvest and the tall corn growing?       They have passed like rain on the mountain, like a wind in the meadow;        The days have gone down in the West behind the hills into shadow.        Who shall gather the smoke of the dead wood burning,       Or behold the flowing years from the Sea returning?       Thus spoke a  forgotten poet long ago in Rohan, recalling how tall  and  fair  was Eorl the Young,  who rode  down out  of the  North; and there were  wings upon the feet  of  his steed, Felaruf, father   of horses. So men still  sing in the evening.'       With these words the travellers passed the silent mounds. Following the  winding way  up the  green shoulders  of the hills, they came at last to the  wide wind-swept walls and the gates of Edoras.        There sat many men in bright mail, who sprang at once to their feet and  barred  the  way with spears.  'Stay, strangers here unknown!' they cried in  the tongue  of  the  Riddermark,  demanding  the  names and  errand  of  the   strangers. Wonder was in their eyes but little friendliness; and they looked  darkly upon Gandalf.        'Well do I  understand your speech,' he answered  in the same language;  'yet few strangers do so. Why then do you not speak in the Common Tongue,  as  is the custom in the West, if you wi sh to be answered?'       'It is the will of Thjoden King that  none should enter his gates, save  those who know our tongue and are our friends,'  replied one of the  guards.   'None are welcome here in days of war but our  own folk, and those that come   ####-from Mundburg in the land of Gondor. Who are you that come heedless over  the  plain thus strangely clad, riding horses like to our own  horses? Long  have  we kept  guard here,  and we  have watched you from afar. Never have we seen  other riders so strange, nor any horse more proud than is  one of these that  bear  you.  He is One  of the  Mearas, unless our eyes  are cheated  by some  spell. Say, are you not a wizard,  some spy from Saruman, or phantoms of his  craft? Speak now and be swift!'       'We are  no phantoms,' said Aragorn,  'nor do your  eyes  cheat you. For   indeed these are your own horses  that  we ride, as  you  knew well are  you   asked, I  guess. But seldom  does thief  ride  home to the  stable. Here are  Hasufel and Arod, that Jomer,  the  Third Marsha l  of the Mark,  lent to us,   only two  days ago. We bring them back now, even as we promised him. Has  not  Jomer then returned and given warning of our coming?'       A troubled look came  into the guard's eyes. 'Of Jomer I have naught to  say,' he answered. 'If  what you tell me  is  truth,  then doubtless Thjoden  will  have heard of it. Maybe your coming was not wholly unlooked-for. It is  but two nights ago that Wormtongue came to us and  said that by  the will of   Thjoden no stranger should pass these gates."
