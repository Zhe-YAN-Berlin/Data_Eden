I think the Ents  and Huorns that had been away  came  back  then; but where they have all gone to  now, I  don't  know. It  was  a   misty,  moisty morning  when we  climbed down  and  looked  round again,  and  nobody was about. And that is  about all there  is  to tell. It seems almost  peaceful  now after all  the turmoil. And safer too, somehow,  since Gandalf  came back. I could sleep!'       They  all fell silent  for a while. Gimli re-filled his pipe. 'There is  one thing I wonder about,' he  said as he lit it with his  flint and tinder:  'Wormtongue. You told Thjoden he was with Saruman. How did he get there?'       'Oh yes,  I forgot about him,'  said Pippin. 'He did not get here  till  this morning. We had just lit the fire and had some breakfast when Treebeard  appeared again. We heard him hooming and calling our names outside.       '\"I have just come round to see how  you are faring, my lads,' he said;  'and to give you some news. Huorns have come back. All's well; aye very well  indeed!\" he laughed, and slapped his  thighs. \"No more Orcs  in Isengard, no  more axes! And there will be folk  coming up from the South before the day is  old; some that you may be glad to see.\"       'He had hardly said that, when we heard the sound of hoofs on the road.  We rushed out  before the gates, and  I stood and stared,  half expecting to  see Strider  and Gandalf come riding up at the head of  an army. But  out of  the  mist there  rode a man on  an old tired  horse; and he  looked  a queer    ####-twisted sort of creature  himself. There was no one  else. When he came. out  of the  mist and suddenly saw  all the ruin and wreckage in front of him, he  sat and gaped, and his face went almost green. He was so bewildered that  he  did not seem to notice us at first. When he did, he gave a cry, and tried to  turn his horse round and ride off. But Treebeard took three strides,  put out  a long  arm, and  lifted him out  of the saddle. His horse bolted in terror,  and he grovelled  on the ground. He said he was Grnma, friend and counsellor   of  the  king,  and had  been sent  with important messages  from Thjoden to  Saruman.       '\"No one else would dare to ride through the open land, so full of foul  Orcs,\" he said,  \"so I was sent. And I have had a perilous journey, and I am  hungry and weary. I fled far north out of my way, pursued by wolves.\"       'I caught the sidelong looks he gave to Treebeard, and I said to myself  \"liar\".  Treebeard looked at him in  his long slow  way for several minutes,  till the wretched man was squirming on the floor. Then at last he said: \"Ha,  hm, I was expecting  you, Master Wormtongue.\" The man  started a t that name.  \"Gandalf got  here first. So I know as much about you  as I need, and I know  what to do with you. Put all the rats in one trap, said Gandalf; and I will.  I am the master of Isengard now, but Saruman is locked in his tower; and you  can go there and give him all the messages that you can think of.\"       '\"Let me go, let me go!\" said Wormtongue. \"I know the way.\"       '\"You knew the way, I  don't doubt,\"  said Treebeard. \"But  things have  changed here a little. Go and see!\"       'He let Wormtongue go, and he limped off through the arch with us close   behind, until he came inside  the ring and could see all the floods that lay  between him and Orthanc. Then he turned to us.       '\"Let me go away!\" he whined. \"Let  me go away! My messages are useless  now.\"       '\"They are indeed,\" said Treebeard. \"But you have only two  choices: to  stay  with me until  Gandalf and your master arrive; or to  cross the water.  Which will you have?\"       'The man shivered at the mention of his master, and put a foot into the  water; but he drew back. \"I cannot swim,\" he said.       '\"The  water is not deep,\" said Treebeard. \"It is dirty,  but that will  not harm you, Master Wormtongue. In you go now!\"       'With that the wretch  floundered off into the flood. It rose up nearly  to his neck before  he got too far away for me to see him. The last I saw of   ####-him was clinging to some old barrel or  piece of  wood. But  Treebeard waded  after him, and watched his progress.        '\"Well, he has gone in,\" he said when he returned. \"I saw  him crawling  up  the steps like a draggled  rat. There is someone  in  the tower still: a   hand came out and pulled him in. So there he is, and I  hope  the welcome is  to  his liking. Now  I  must go and wash myself clean  of the slime. I'll be  away  up on the north side,  if anyone wants to see  me. There  is no  clean  water down here  fit for an  Ent to drink. or to bathe in. So I will ask you   two lads to keep a watch at  the gate for the folk that are coming. There'll  be the Lord of the Fields of Rohan, mark you! You must welcome  him as  well  as you know how: his men have fought a great fight with the Orcs. Maybe, you   know the right fashion  of Men's words  for such a  lord,  better than Ents."
