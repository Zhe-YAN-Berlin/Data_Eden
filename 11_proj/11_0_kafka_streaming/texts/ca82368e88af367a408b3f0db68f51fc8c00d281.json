The Tree in the Court  of  the  Fountain is still withered and barren. When shall  I see a sign that it will  ever be otherwise?'       'Turn your face from the  green world, and look where all seems  barren   ####-and cold!' said Gandalf.        Then Aragorn  turned. and there was  a  stony  slope behind him running   down from  the skirts of the snow; and as he looked he  was aware that alone  there in the waste a growing thing stood. And he climbed to it, and saw that  out of  the very edge  of the snow there sprang a sapling tree no  more than  three  foot  high. Already it had  put forth young  leaves long and shapely,  dark above and silver beneath,  and upon its slender crown it bore one small   cluster of flowers whose white petals shone like the sunlit snow.        Then Aragorn cried:  'Yj! ut®vienyes! I  have found it!  Lo! here is  a   scion  of the Eldest of Trees!  But how comes it here? For it  is not itself  yet seven years old.'       And Gandalf coming  looked at it, and said: 'Verily this is a sapling of  the line of  Nimloth the fair; and that was a seedling  of Galathilion,  and  that a fruit of Telperion of  many names, Eldest of Trees. Who shall say how  it comes here  in the appointed hour? But this is an ancient hallow, and ere  the kings  failed or the Tree  withered in the court, a fruit must have been  set here.  For it is said that, though the fruit of the Tree comes seldom to  ripeness, yet the life within may then lie sleeping through many long years,  and none can foretell the time in which it will awake. Remember this. For if  ever  a fruit ripens,  it should  be planted, lest  the  line die out of the  world. Here it has lain. hidden on the mountain, even as the race of Elendil  lay hidden in the wastes of the North. Yet the line of Nimloth is older  far  than your line, King Elessar.'       Then Aragorn laid his hand  gently to the sapling, and lo! it seemed to  hold only lightly to the earth, and it was removed without hurt; and Aragorn  bore it back  to  the Citadel. Then the withered tree was uprooted, but with  reverence; and they did not burn it, but laid it  to rest in the silence  of  Rath Dnnen. And Aragorn planted the new tree in the  court by the  fountain,  and swiftly and gladly it began to grow; and when the month  of June entered  in it was laden with blossom.       'The sign has been given,'  said Aragorn, 'and the day is not far off.'  And he set watchmen upon the walls.        It was the day  before Midsummer  when messengers came from Amon D(n  to  the  City,  and  they said that there was a  riding of fair folk out of  the  North,  and they drew near now to  the walls of the Pelennor. And  the  King  said: 'At last they have come. Let all the City be made ready!'   ####-     Upon the very Eve of Midsummer, when  the sky  was blue as sapphire and  white stars opened in the East,  but the West was still  golden  and the air  was  cool and  fragrant, the riders came down the North-way to the gates  of  Minas Tirith. First rode Elrohir  and  Elladan with a  banner of silver, and  then  came Glorfindel  and Erestor  and  all the household of Rivendell, and   after them came the Lady Galadriel and Celeborn,  Lord of Lothlurien, riding  upon white steeds and with  them many fair folk of their land,  grey-cloaked  with  white  gems in their hair; and last came Master  Elrond, mighty  among  Elves and Men, bearing the sceptre of Ann®minas,  and beside him upon a  grey  palfrey rode Arwen his daughter, Evenstar of her people.       And Frodo when he saw her come glimmering in the evening, with stars on  her brow and a sweet fragrance about her,  was moved with  great wonder, and  he said to Gandalf: 'At  last I  understand why we  have waited! This is the  ending. Now not day only shall be beloved, but  night too shall be beautiful  and blessed and all its fear pass away!'       Then  the  King welcomed  his  guests, and  they  alighted;  and Elrond  surrendered  the sceptre, and  laid the hand of  his daughter in the hand of  the King, and together they went up into  the  High City,  and a ll the stars  flowered in the sky.  And  Aragorn the King Elessar wedded Arwen Undumiel  in  the City of the Kings upon the day of Midsummer, and  the tale of their long  waiting and labours was come to fulfilment.     ####-   Chapter 6. Many Partings            When the days of rejoicing were over at last the Companions  thought of  returning to their own homes.  And Frodo went to the  King as he was sitting  with the Queen Arwen by  the fountain, and she sang a song of Valinor, while  the Tree grew and blossomed. They welcomed Frodo  and rose to greet him;  and  Aragorn said:       'I  know what you have come to say, Frodo: you wish to  return to  your  own  home. Well, dearest friend,  the tree grows  best  in the  land of  its  sires; but  for  you in  all  the lands of the  West  there will  ever  be a   welcome."
