'Lady,' he answered, 'you are  not  yet  healed, and I was commanded to  tend you  with especial care. You should  not  have risen  from your bed for   seven days yet , or so I was bidden. I beg you to go back.'       'I am  healed,' she said,  'healed at  least in body, save  my left arm  only, and  that is at ease. But I shall sicken anew, if there is naught that  I can do. Are there no tidings of war? The women can tell  me nothing.'       'There are  no tidings,' said the Warden,  'save  that  the  Lords have  ridden to Morgul Vale; and men say that the new captain out  of the North is  their chief. A great lord is that, and a  healer;  and it is a thing passing  strange to me that  the healing hand should  also wield the sword. It is not  thus  in Gondor now,  though once it was  so, if old tales be  true. But for   long years we healers have only sought to patch the rents made by the men of  swords. Though we should still have enough  to do without them: the world is  full enough of hurts and mischances without wars to multiply them.'       It needs but one foe to breed a war, not two,  Master  Warden, answered  Jowyn. 'And those who  have not swords can  still die  upon them. Would  you   have  the folk  of Gondor gather you herbs  only, when the Dark Lord gathers   ####-armies? And it  is not  always good  to be healed in  body. Nor is it always  evil to die in battle, even  in bitter pain. Were I permitted,  in this dark  hour I would choose the latter.'       The Warden looked at her. Tall she stood there, her eyes  bright in her   white face, her hand clenched as she turned and gazed out of his window that  opened to the East. He sighed and shook his head. After a pause  she  turned  to him again.       'Is there no deed to do?' she said. 'Who commands in this City?'       'I do not  rightly know,' he  answered. 'Such things are  not my  care.  There is a marshal over the Riders  of Rohan; and the Lord HÂ®rin, I am told,  commands the men of Gondor. But  the Lord Faramir is by right the Steward of  the City.'       'Where can I find him?'       'In this house, lady. He was sorely  hurt,  but is now set again on the  way to health. But I do not know--'       'Will you not bring me to him? Then you will know. '       The Lord  Faramir was  walking  alone in  the garden  of the  Houses of  Healing, and the sunlight warmed him, and he felt life run new in his veins;  but his heart  was heavy, and he looked  out  over the  walls  eastward. And  coming, the Warden  spoke his name, and he turned and saw the Lady  Jowyn  of  Rohan; and he  was  moved with pity, for  he saw that she was hurt,  and his  clear sight perceived her sorrow and unrest.       'My lord,' said  the Warden, 'here is the Lady Jowyn of Rohan. She rode  wi th the king and  was sorely hurt, and dwells now in my keeping. But she is  not content, and she wishes to speak to the Steward of the City.'       'Do not misunderstand him, lord,'  said Jowyn. 'It is not lack  of care  that  grieves me.  No  houses  could be  fairer, for those who  desire to be  healed.  But I  cannot  lie  in sloth,  idle,  caged. I looked  for death in  battle. But I have not died, and battle still goes on.'       At a sign from  Faramir, the Warden bowed and departed. 'What would you   have me do, lady?' said Faramir.  'I also am a prisoner of the healers.'  He  looked  at her, and being a man  whom pity deeply stirred,  it seemed to him  that her loveliness amid her grief would pierce his heart. And she looked at  him and saw the grave tenderness in his eyes, and yet knew, for she was bred  among men of war, that here was one whom no Rider of the Mark would  outmatch   ####-in battle.       'What  do you wish?' he said again. 'If  it lies in my power, I will do  it.'       'I would have  you  command this  Warden, and bid him  let me go,'  she  said; but though her words were still proud, her heart faltered, and for the  first time she doubted herself. She  guessed  that this tall man, both stern  and  gentle, might think  her merely wayward, like a child that has not  the  firmness of mind to go on with a dull task to the end.       'I myself am  in the Warden's  keeping,' answered Faramir. 'Nor  have I  yet taken  up my authority in the City. But  had I done so,  I  should still  listen to  his counsel,  and should  not cross  his will in  matters of  his  craft, unless in some great need.'       'But I do not desire healing,' she said. 'I wish to ride to war like my  brother Jomer, or better  like  Thjoden the king, for he  died  and has both  honour and peace.'       'It  is too late, lady,  to follow the Captains, even  if you  had  the  strength,'  said Faramir.  'But death  in battle  may  come  to  us all yet,  willing  or unwilling. You will be  better prepared to  face it in your  own  manner, if while there is still time you do as the Healer commanded. You and  I, we must endure with patience the hours of waiting."
