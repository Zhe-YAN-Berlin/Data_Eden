'But the  nearer they get to the  Enemy's land the more like Stinker Slinker will get.   ####-Mark my words: if ever we get to the pass, he  won't let us really take  the  precious thing over the border without making some kind of trouble.'       `We haven't got there yet,' said Frodo.       'No, but we'd better keep our eyes skinned till we do.  If we're caught  napping, Stinker will come out on top pretty quick. Not but what it would be  safe for you to have a wink now, master.  Safe, if you lay close  to me. I'd  be dearly glad to see you have a sleep. I'd keep watch over you; and anyway,  if you lay near, with my arm round you, no one could come pawing you  without  your Sam knowing it.'       `Sleep!'  said  Frodo and sighed, as if out of  a desert  he had seen a   mirage of cool green. 'Yes, even here I could sleep.'       `Sleep then, master! Lay your head in my lap.'       And so Gollum found  them hours later, when  he returned,  crawling and   creeping down the path out  of the gloom ahead. Sam sat  propped against the  stone, his head dropping  sideways and his   breathing heavy. In his  lap lay  Frodo's head,  drowned deep in  sleep; upon his white  forehead lay  one  of  Sam's brown hands, and the  other lay softly upon his master's breast. Peace  was in both their faces.        Gollum looked at them. A strange expression passed over his lean hungry  face.  The gleam faded from his eyes,  and they went dim and grey,  old  and   tired. A spasm of pain seemed to twist him, and he turned away, peering back  up towards  the  pass,  shaking  his head, as  if engaged in  some   interior   debate. Then he came back, and  slowly  putting out  a trembling  hand, very  cautiously he touched Frodo's knee  -- but almost the touch was a caress. For   a fleeting moment,  could one of the sleepers have seen him, they would have  thought that they beheld an old weary hobbit, shrunken by the years that had  carried him far beyond his time, beyond friends and kin,  and the fields and  streams of youth, an old starved pitiable thing.       But at that touch Frodo stirred and cried out softly in  his sleep, and  immediately Sam was wide awake. The first thing he saw was Gollum  --  `pawing  at master,' as he thought.       `Hey you!' he said roughly. `What are you up to?'       'Nothing, nothing,' said Gollum softly. `Nice Master!'       `I daresay,' said Sam. 'But where have you been to  -- sneaking off and  sneaking back, you old villain? '   ####-     Gollum withdrew himself, and a green glint  flickered under  his  heavy  lids. Almost  spider -like  he  looked now, crouched  back on his bent limbs,  with his  protruding eyes. The fleeting  moment  had  passed, beyond recall.   `Sneaking,  sneaking!'  he  hissed.  'Hobbits always  so polite, yes. O nice  hobbits! Smjagol brings them  up secret  ways that  nobody else  could find.   Tired he is, thirsty  he is, yes thirsty; and he guides them and he searches  for paths, and they say sneak, sneak. Very nice friends,  O yes my precious,   very nice.'       Sam felt  a bit remorseful, though not more trustful. 'Sorry.' he said.  'I'm sorry, but you startled me out of my sleep. And I  shouldn't  have been  sleeping, and that made me a bit sharp.  But Mr.  Frodo.  he's that tired, I  asked him to have a wink; and well,  that's how it is. Sorry. But where have  you been to? '       `Sneaking,' said Gollum, and the green glint did not leave his  eyes.       'O very well,' said Sam, `have it your own way! I don't suppose it's so  far  from the truth. And now  we'd  better all  be  sneaking along together.  What's the time? Is it today or tomorrow? '       'It's tomorrow,' said Gollum, 'or this  was  tomorrow when hobbits went  to sleep. Very foolish, very dangerous-if poor Smjagol wasn't sneaking about  to watch.'       `I think we shall  get tired  of that word soon,' said Sam. 'But  never   mind.  I'll  wake master up.' Gently he smoothed the hair back  fr om Frodo's  brow, and bending down spoke softly to him.       `Wake up, Mr. Frodo! Wake up! '       Frodo stirred  and  opened  his  eyes,  and  smiled, seeing Sam's  face  bending over him.  `Calling me early  aren't you,  Sam?' he said. `It's dark  still!  '       'Yes  it's  always  dark here,' said  Sam. `But Gollum's come  back Mr.  Frodo, and he says it's tomorrow. So we must be walking on. The last lap.'       Frodo drew a deep breath  and sat up. `The last lap! ' he said. 'Hullo,  Smjagol! Found any food? Have you had any rest? '       `No food, no rest, nothing for Smjagol,' said Gollum. `He's a sneak.'       Sam clicked his tongue, but restrained himself.       'Don't  take  names to  yourself,  Smjagol,'  said Frodo. 'It's  unwise  whether they are true or false.'       `Smjagol has to take what's given  him,' answered Gollum. 'He was given  that name by kind Master Samwise, the hobbit that knows so much.'   ####-     Frodo looked at Sam."
