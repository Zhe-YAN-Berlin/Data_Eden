  "text": " Bilbo's  residence had got rather cluttered up  with things in the course of his long   ####-life.  It was a  tendency of hobbit-holes to get cluttered up: for which the  custom of giving so many birthday-presents was largely responsible.  Not, of  course,  that the  birthday-presents  were always new,  there were one or two  old mathoms  of forgotten uses that had circulated all around  the district;  but Bilbo had usually given new presents, and  kept  those that he received.  The old hole was now being cleared a little.       Every  one  of  the various  parting  gifts  had  labels,  written  out  personally  by Bilbo,  and several had some point,  or  some  joke.  But, of  course,  most  of the  things were  given where  they  would  be  wanted and  welcome. The  poorer hobbits, and especially  those of Bagshot Row, did very  well. Old Gaffer  Gamgee got  two sacks of potatoes, a new spade, a  woollen  waistcoat,  and  a   bottle  of  ointment  for  creaking  joints.  Old  Rory  Brandybuck,  in  return  for  much  hospitality, got a dozen  bottles of Old  Winyards: a strong red wine from the Southfarthing, and now quite mature, as  it had been laid down by Bilbo's father. Rory quite forgave Bilbo, and voted  him a capital fellow after the first bottle.       There was plenty of everything left for Frodo.  And, of course, all the  chief  treasures, as well  as  the  books,  pictures, and  more than  enough  furniture,  were  left  in his possession. There was,  however, no sign  nor   mention of money or jewellery: not a  penny-piece or  a glass bead was given  away.       Frodo had a  very  trying time that afternoon. A fa lse rumour  that the  whole household was being distributed free spread like wildfire; and  before  long  the place was packed with  people who had no business there, but could  not be kept out. Labels got torn off and mixed, and quarrels broke out. Some   people tried to do swaps and deals in the hall; and others tried to make off  with minor  items not  addressed to  them,  or  with  anything  that  seemed  unwanted  or unwatched.  The road to the gate  was blocked  with barrows and  handcarts.        In the middle of  the  commotion the Sackville-Bagginses arrived. Frodo   had retired for a while and left his  friend Merry Brandybuck to keep an eye  on things. When Otho loudly demanded to see Frodo, Merry bowed politely.        'He is indisposed,' he said. 'He is resting.'       'Hiding, you mean,'  said  Lobelia. 'Anyway we want  to see him and  we  mean to see him. Just go and tell him so!'       Merry left them a long while in the hall, and they had time to discover   their parting gift  of spoons. It did  not improve their tempers. Eventually   ####-they were shown into the study. Frodo was sitting at a  table with a lot  of  papers in front of him. He looked indisposed - to see Sackville-Bagginses at  any  rate;  and he stood up,  fidgeting with something in his pocket. But he  spoke quite politely.       The Sackville-Bagginses were  rather offensive. They began  by offering  him  bad  bargain-prices  (as between  friends)  for  various  valuable  and  unlabelled  things.  When  Frodo  replied  that  only  the  things specially  directed by Bilbo were being given away, they said the whole affair was very  fishy.       'Only one thing  is clear to me,' said Otho, 'and that  is that you are  doing exceedingly well out of it. I insist on seeing the will.'       Otho would  have been Bilbo's heir, but for  the  adoption of Frodo. He  read the will carefully and  snorted. It was,  unfortunately, very clear and  correct (according to the legal customs of hobbits, which demand among other   things seven signatures of witnesses in red ink).       'Foiled again!' he said  to his  wife. 'And after waiting sixty   years.   Spoons? Fiddlesticks!' He snapped his fingers under Frodo's nose and slumped  off. But Lobelia was not so easily got rid of. A little later Frodo came out  of the study  to see how things were going  on and found her still about the  place, investigating nooks  and comers and  tapping the  floors. He escorted  her firmly off the premises, after he had relieved her of several small (but  rather valuable) articles that had somehow fallen inside  her umbrella.  Her   face looked as if  she was in the throes of thinking out a  really  crushing  parting remark; but all she found to say, turning round on the step, was:        'You'll live to regret  it, young  fellow! Why  didn't you  go too? You   don't belong here; you're no Baggins  - you - you're a Brandybuck!'       'Did you hear that, Merry? That was an insult, if you like,' said Frodo  as he shut the door on her.       'It was a compliment,' said Merry  Brandybuck, 'and so, of  course, not  true.'       Then they went  round the hole,  and  evicted three  young hobbits (two  Boffins and a Bolger) who were knocking  holes  in the  walls  of one of the  cellars.  Frodo  also had a  tussle  with young Sancho  Proudfoot  (old  Odo  Proudfoot's  grandson),  who had  begun an  excavation in the larger pantry,  where  he thought there was an echo."
