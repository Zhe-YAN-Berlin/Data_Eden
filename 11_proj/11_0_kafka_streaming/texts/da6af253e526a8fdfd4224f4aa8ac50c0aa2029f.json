There  upon its spur stood  high walls  of  ancient stone, and within them was a lofty  tower. Men said that  in the  far-off  days of  the glory  of  Gondor  the  sea -kings  had built here this  fastness with the hands of giants. The Hornburg it was called, for a trumpet  sounded  upon   the   tower  echoed  in  the  Deep  behind,  as   i f  armies   ####-long-forgotten  were issuing to war from  caves beneath the  hills. A  wall,  too,  the men  of old  had made  from the  Hornburg to  the  southern cliff,   barring  the  entrance  to  the gorge.  Beneath  it by a  wide  culvert  the  Deeping-stream passed out.  About the  feet  of  the Hornrock it wound,  and   flowed  then in  a gully through the  midst of a wide  green  gore,  sloping  gently  down  from  Helm's Gate  to  Helm's Dike.  Thence it  fell into  the  Deeping-coomb and  out into  the Westfold  Vale.  There  in the  Hornburg at  Helm's Gate Erkenbrand, master  of Westfold on the borders of the  Mark, now  dwelt. As the days darkened with threat of war, being  wise, he had repaired  the wall and made the fastness strong.       The Riders were still  in the low valley before the  mouth of the Coomb,  when cries and  hornblasts were heard  from their scouts that went in front.  Out of the  darkness arrows whistled. Swiftly a scout rode back and reported   that wolf-riders were abroad in the valley, and tha t a host of Orcs and wild  men were hurrying southward from the Fords of  Isen and seemed  to be  making  for Helm's Deep.       'We have found many of our folk lying slain as they fled thither,' said  the scout. 'And we  have met scattered companies, going  this way  and that,   leaderless. What has become of Erkenbrand  none seem to  know.  It is likely  that  he  will be  overtaken  ere he can  reach Helm's Gate, if  he  has not  already perished.'       'Has aught been seen of Gandalf?' asked Thjoden.       'Yes,   lord. Many have seen an old man in white upon a  horse,  passing  hither and thither over the  plains like wind in  the grass. Some thought he  was Saruman. It  is said  that he went away ere  nightfall towards Isengard.  Some say also  that  Wormtongue was  seen  earlier,  going northward  with a  company of Orcs.'       'It  will  go ill  with Wormtongue,  if  Gandalf  comes  upon  him said  Thjoden.  'Nonetheless I miss now both my  counsellors, the old and the new.   But in this need we have no better choice than to go on, as Gandalf said, to  Helm's Gate, whether Erkenbrand be there or no. Is it known how great is the  host that comes from the North?'       'It is very great,' said the scout. 'He  that flies counts every foeman  twice, yet I have spoken  to stouthearted  men, and I do not doubt that  the  main strength of the enemy is many times as great as all that we have here.'       'Then let us be swift,' said Jomer. 'Let us drive through such foes  as   ####-are  already  between  us  and the  fastness. There are caves in Helm's Deep  where hundreds may lie hid; and secret ways lead thence up on to the hills.        'Trust not to secret ways,' said the king. 'Saruman  has long spied out  this land. Still in that place our defence may last long. Let us go!'       Aragorn and  Legolas went now with Jomer in the van. On through the dark  night they rode, ever  slower as the darkness deepened and their way climbed  southward, higher and higher into the  dim folds about the  mountains' feet.  They  found  few of the  enemy before  them. Here and  there they came  upon  roving bands of Orcs; but they fled ere the Riders could take or slay them.       'It will not be long I fear,' said Jomer, 'ere the coming of the king's  host will be known to the leader of our enemies, Saruman or whatever captain  he has sent forth.'       The rumour of war grew behind them. Now they could hear, borne over the  dark,  the  sound  of harsh  singing.  They  had  climbed far  up  into  the  Deeping-coomb  when they looked back. Then they saw torches countless  points  of fiery light upon the  black fields behind, scattered like red flowers, or   winding  up from  the lowlands in  long flickering lines.  Here and  there a   larger blaze leapt up.       'It is a great host and follows us hard,' said Aragorn.       'They br ing fire,' said Thjoden,  'and they are  burning as  they come,  rick, cot, and tree. This was  a rich vale and had many homesteads. Alas for   my folk!'       'Would that day  was here and we might ride down upon them like a storm  out of the mountains!' said Aragorn. 'It grieves me to fly before them.'       'We need not  fly much further,' said Jomer.  'Not  far ahead now  lies  Helm's  Dike,  an  ancient trench  and rampart scored across the  coomb, two  furlongs below Helm's Gate. There we can turn and give ba ttle.'       'Nay, we are too  few to defend the Dike,' said Thjoden. 'It  is a mile  long or more, and the breach in it is wide."
