Boromir set his shoulder against the western door.       `Wait a  moment! Do not close it yet! ' said Gandalf. He sprang forward  to Boromir 's side and drew himself up to his full height.       'Who  comes hither  to disturb the rest of  Balin Lord of Moria?  '  he  cried in a loud voice.       There was a  rush of  hoarse laughter, like the fall  of sliding stones  into a pit; amid the clamour a deep voice was raised in command. Doom,  boom,  doom went the drums in the deep.       With a quick movement Gandalf stepped before  the narrow opening of the  door and thrust forward his staff:  There was a dazzling flash that  lit the  chamber  and the  passage  outside. For an instant  the wizard  looked  out.  Arrows whined and whistled down the corridor as he sprang back.       'There are  Orcs, very many of them,' he said. `And some are  large and  evil: black Uruks of Mordor. For the moment they are hanging back, but there  is something else there. A great  cave-troll,  I  think,  or more than  one.  There is no hope of escape that way.'       'And no hope at all, if they  come at the other  door  as  well,'  said  Boromir.       'There is no sound outside here yet,' said Aragorn, who was standing by  the eastern door listening. `The passage on  this side plunges straight down  a stair: it plainly does not lead back towards the hall. But it  is  no good  flying blindly  this way with the  pursuit  just behind. We cannot block the  door. Its key is gone and the lock is broken, and it  opens inwards. We must   do something to delay the enemy first. We will make them fear the Chamber of  Mazarbul!' he said grimly feeling the edge of his sword, AndÂ®ril.       Heavy feet  were  heard in the corridor. Boromir  flung himself against   the door  and heaved it to; then  he wedged it  with broken sword-blades and  splinters of wood. The Company retreated  to the other  side of the chamber.  But they had no chance to fly yet. There was a b low on the door that made it  quiver;  and then it began  to grind slowly open, driving back the wedges. A  huge  arm and shoulder, with  a  dark skin of  greenish scales,  was  thrust   through  the  widening  gap.  Then a  great,  flat,  toeless foot was for ced  through below. There was a dead silence outside.   ####-     Boromir leaped forward and hewed at the arm with all his might; but his  sword  rang, glanced  aside, and  fell  from his shaken  hand. The blade was  notched.       Suddenly, and to his  own surprise,  Frodo  felt a hot wrath blaze up in  his heart. `The Shire! ' he cried, and springing beside Boromir, he stooped,  and stabbed with Sting at the hideous foot. There was a bellow, and the foot   jerked back, nearly  wrenching  Sting from Frodo's arm.  Black dr ops dripped  from the blade and smoked on the floor. Boromir  hurled  himself against the  door and slammed it again.       `One for the Shire! '  cried  Aragorn. `The hobbit's bite is  deep! You   have a good blade, Frodo son of Drogo! '       There was a crash  on the door, followed by crash after crash. Rams  and  hammers were  beating against it.  It cracked  and staggered  back,  and the  opening grew  suddenly  wide.  Arrows  came  whistling  in, but  struck  the   northern wall, and fell harmlessly to the floor . There  was a horn-blast and  a rush of feet, and orcs one after another leaped into the chamber.       How many there were the Company could  not count. The affray was sharp,  but the orcs were dismayed by the fierceness of  the  defence. Legolas  shot  two  through the throat.  Gimli hewed the legs from  under another that  had  sprung up on Balin's  tomb. Boromir and Aragorn slew many. When thirteen  had  fallen the rest fled shrieking. leaving the  defenders unharmed, except  for   Sam who had  a scratch along the scalp.  A  quick duck had saved him; and he  had  felled  his  orc:  a sturdy  thrust with his  Barrow-blade. A  fire was  smouldering  in his  brown  eyes  that would  have  made  Ted Sandyman  step  backwards, if he had seen it.       `Now  is  the  time! ' cried  Gandalf.  `Let us  go,  before the  troll  returns!'       But even as they retreated, and before Pippin and Merry had reached the  stair  outside,  a  huge orc-chieftain, almost man-high, clad in black  mail  from  head  to foot,  leaped  into  the chamber;  behind  him his  followers  clustered in the doorway. His broad flat  face was swart, his eyes were like  coals, and  his tongue  was red; he wielded a great  spear. With a thrust of  his  huge hide shield he  turned  Boromir's  sword  and  bore him backwards,   throwing him to  the ground. Diving under Aragorn's blow with the speed of a   striking  snake  he  charged  into  the Company  and  thrust with  his spear  straight  at  Frodo.  The blow caught  him  on the right side, and Frodo was   ####-hurled  against  the  wall and  pinned."
