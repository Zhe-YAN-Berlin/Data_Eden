With that the  company said  farewell to the island  and the mound, and  passed over the river, and climbed the further bank. Then they rode on, glad  to have left the mournful  Fords. As they  went  the  howling of the  wolves  broke out anew.       There  was an  ancient highway that  ran  down  from  Isengard  to  the   ####-crossings. For some way i t took its course beside the river, bending with it  east  and  then north; but at  the last it  turned away  and  went  straight  towards the gates of Isengard; and these were under the mountain-side in the   west of the valley, sixteen miles  or more from its mouth.  This  road  they  followed but they  did not ride upon it;  for the ground beside it  was firm  and level, covered for many miles about with short springing turf. They rode   now more swiftly, and by midnight the Fords were nearly five leagues behind.  Then they halted, ending their night's journey, for the King was weary. They  were come to  the feet  of the  Misty  Mountains, and the long  arms of  Nan  Curunnr stretched down to  meet them. Dark lay the vale before them, for the  moon had  passed  into  the West, and its light was hidden by the hills. But  out of the deep shadow of the dale rose a vast spire of smoke and vapour; as  it mounted, it caught the rays of the sinking moon, and spread in shimmering  billows, black and silver, over the starry sky.       'What do you  think  of that,  Gandalf?' asked Aragorn.  'One would say  that all the Wizard's Vale was burning.'       'There  is ever a fume above  that  valley in these  days,' said Jomer:  'but I have never seen aught like this before. These are  steams rather than  smokes. Saruman is brewing some devilry to greet us. Maybe he is boiling all  the waters of Isen, and that is why the river runs dry.'       'Maybe he is,' said Gandalf. 'Tomorrow we shall learn what he is doing.  Now let us rest for a while,  if we can.'       They camped  beside  the bed of the Isen river; it was still silent and  empty. Some of them slept a little. But late in the night the watchmen cried  out, and all awoke. The moon was gone.  Stars were  shining  above; but over  the ground there crept a darkness blacker than the night.  On both  sides of  the river it rolled towards them, going northward.       'Stay where you are!' said Gandalf. 'Draw no weapons! Wait! and it will  pass you by!'       A mist gathered about  them. Above  them a  few stars  still  glimmered  faintly;  but  on either side there arose  walls of impenetrable gloom; they  were in a narrow  lane between moving towers of shadow. Voices  they  heard,  whisperings  and groanings and an  endless  rustling sigh;  the  earth shook  under them. Long  it  seemed to them that they sat  and  were afraid; but at  last the darkness and the rumour passed, and vanished between the mountain's  arms.       Away south upon the Hornburg, in the  middle  night  men heard a  great   ####-noise, as a wind  in the valley, and the ground trembled; and all were afraid  and no one ventured to go forth. But in the morning  they went  out and were  amazed; for  the slain Orcs were gone, and the trees also. Far down into the  valley of the Deep  the grass was crushed   and trampled brown,  as if  giant  herdsmen had  pastured  great droves of  cattle there;  but a mile below the  Dike a huge pit had  been delved in the earth, and over it stones were piled  into  a  hill.  Men believed that the Orcs whom they had  slain  were buried  there;  but whether those  who had  fled into  the wood were with them, none  could say, for no man  ever  set foot upon that hill. The Death Down it  was  afterwards called, and no grass would grow there. But the strange trees were  never seen in Deeping-coomb again; they had  returned at night, and had gone  far  away to the dark dales  of  Fangorn.  Thus they were  revenged upon the  Orcs.       The king  and his company slept  no more that  night;  but they saw and  heard  no other strange thing,  sa ve one: the voice of the river beside them  suddenly  awoke. There  was a  rush of water hurrying down among the stones;   and when it had  passed, the Isen flowed and bubbled in its bed again, as it  had ever done.       At  dawn  they made ready to go on. The light came grey  and pale,  and  they  did  not see  the rising of the sun. The air above was heavy with fog,  and a reek lay on the land about them. They went slowly, riding now upon the  highway.  It  was broad and  hard, and  well -tended. Dimly through the mists  they could  descry the long arm of the mountains rising on  their left. They  had passed into Nan Curunnr, the Wizard's Vale. That was a sheltered valley,  open only to the South. Once  it had been fair and green, and through it the  Isen flowed, already deep and strong before it found  the plains; for it was  fed by many springs and lesser streams among  the rain-washed hills."
