I’ll break the other one for you if you ask nicely.  Grenn was sixteen and a head taller than Jon. All four of them were bigger than he was, but they did not scare him. He’d beaten every one of them in the yard.   Maybe we’ll break you,  one of the rapers said.   Try.  Jon reached back for his sword, but one of them grabbed his arm and twisted it behind his back.   You make us look bad,  complained Toad.   You looked bad before I ever met you,  Jon told him. The boy who had his arm jerked upward on him, hard. Pain lanced through him, but Jon would not cry out.  Toad stepped close.  The little lordling has a mouth on him,  he said. He had pig eyes, small and shiny.  Is that your mommy’s mouth, bastard? What was she, some whore? Tell us her name. Maybe I had her a time or two.  He laughed.  Jon twisted like an eel and slammed a heel down across the instep of the boy holding him. There was a sudden cry of pain, and he was free. He flew at Toad, knocked him backward over a bench, and landed on his chest with both hands on his throat, slamming his head against the packed earth.  The two from the Fingers pulled him off, throwing him roughly to the ground. Grenn began to kick at him. Jon was rolling away from the blows when a booming voice cut through the gloom of the armory.  STOP THIS! NOW!   Jon pulled himself to his feet. Donal Noye stood glowering at them.  The yard is for fighting,  the armorer said.  Keep your quarrels out of my armory, or I’ll make them my quarrels. You won’t like that.   Toad sat on the floor, gingerly feeling the back of his head. His fingers came away bloody.  He tried to kill me.    ’S true. I saw it,  one of the rapers put in.   He broke my wrist,  Grenn said again, holding it out to Noye for inspection.  The armorer gave the offered wrist the briefest of glances.  A bruise. Perhaps a sprain. Maester Aemon will give you a salve. Go with him, Todder, that head wants looking after. The rest of you, return to your cells. Not you, Snow. You stay.   Jon sat heavily on the long wooden bench as the others left, oblivious to the looks they gave him, the silent promises of future retribution. His arm was throbbing.   The Watch has need of every man it can get,  Donal Noye said when they were alone.  Even men like Toad. You won’t win any honors killing him.   Jon’s anger flared.  He said my mother was—    —a whore. I heard him. What of it?    Lord Eddard Stark was not a man to sleep with whores,  Jon said icily.  His honor—    —did not prevent him from fathering a bastard. Did it?   Jon was cold with rage.  Can I go?    You go when I tell you to go.   Jon stared sullenly at the smoke rising from the brazier, until Noye took him under the chin, thick fingers twisting his head around.  Look at me when I’m talking to you, boy.   Jon looked. The armorer had a chest like a keg of ale and a gut to match. His nose was flat and broad, and he always seemed in need of a shave. The left sleeve of his black wool tunic was fastened at the shoulder with a silver pin in the shape of a longsword.  Words won’t make your mother a whore. She was what she was, and nothing Toad says can change that. You know, we have men on the Wall whose mothers were whores.   Not my mother, Jon thought stubbornly. He knew nothing of his mother; Eddard Stark would not talk of her. Yet he dreamed of her at times, so often that he could almost see her face. In his dreams, she was beautiful, and highborn, and her eyes were kind.   You think you had it hard, being a high lord’s bastard?  the armorer went on.  That boy Jeren is a septon’s get, and Cotter Pyke is the baseborn son of a tavern wench. Now he commands Eastwatch by the Sea.    I don’t care,  Jon said.  I don’t care about them and I don’t care about you or Thorne or Benjen Stark or any of it. I hate it here. It’s too… it’s cold.    Yes. Cold and hard and mean, that’s the Wall, and the men who walk it. Not like the stories your wet nurse told you. Well, piss on the stories and piss on your wet nurse. This is the way it is, and you’re here for life, same as the rest of us.    Life,  Jon repeated bitterly. The armorer could talk about life. He’d had one. He’d only taken the black after he’d lost an arm at the siege of Storm’s End. Before that he’d smithed for Stannis Baratheon, the king’s brother. He’d seen the Seven Kingdoms from one end to the other; he’d feasted and wenched and fought in a hundred battles. They said it was Donal Noye who’d forged King Robert’s warhammer, the one that crushed the life from Rhaegar Targaryen on the Trident. He’d done all the things that Jon would never do, and then when he was old, well past thirty, he’d taken a glancing blow from an axe and the wound had festered until the whole arm had to come off. Only then, crippled, had Donal Noye come to the Wall, when his life was all but over."
