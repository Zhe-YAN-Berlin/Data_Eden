Indeed  it certainly  would;  for this is the One, and  he is exerting all his power to find it or draw it  to himself.       'Of  course, my  dear  Frodo,  it  was dangerous  for you; and that has  troubled me deeply. But there  was so  much at stake that I had to take some  risk  - though even when  I was far away there has never been a day when the  Shire has not been guarded by watchful eyes. As long as you never used it, I   did not think  that the Ring would have  any lasting effect on  you, not for  evil,  not at any rate for a very long time. And you must remember that nine   ####-years ago, when I last saw you, I still knew little for certain.'       'But  why  not destroy  it, as you say should have been done long ago?'  cried Frodo again. If you had warned me, or even  sent me a message, I would  have done away with it.'       'Would you? How would you do that? Have you ever tried?'       'No. But I suppose one could hammer it or melt it.'       'Try!' said Gandalf. Try now!'       Frodo drew the Ring  out of his pocket again and looked  at it. It  now  appeared  plain and smooth, without  mark or device that  he  could see. The  gold looked very fair and pure, and Frodo thought how rich and beautiful was  its  colour,  how perfect was  its  roundness. It was an admirable thing and  altogether  precious. When he  took  it out he had intended to fling it from  him into the very hottest  part of the  fire. But he found now that he could  not do so, not without a great  struggle. He weighed the  Ring in his  hand,  hesitating,  and forcing himself to remember all that Gandalf had told  him;  and then with an effort of will he made a movement, as if to cast  it away -  but he found that he had put it back in his pocket.       Gandalf laughed grimly. 'You see? Already you too, Frodo, cannot easily  let  it  go,  nor will to damage it. And I  could not \"make\" you - except by  force, which would break your mind. But as for breaking  the Ring, force  is  useless. Even if you  took it and struck it  with a  heavy sledge -hammer,  it  would make no dint in it. It cannot be unmade by your hands, or by mine.       'Your small  fire, of course, would  not melt even ordinary  gold. This  Ring has already passed through it unscathed,  and even unheated.  But there  is  no smith's forge in this Shire that could change it at all. Not even the  anvils and furnaces  of  the Dwarves could do that.  It has been  said  that  dragon-fire could melt and consume the Rings  of Power, but there is not now  any dragon left on earth in which the old fire is hot enough; nor was  there  ever any dragon, not even Ancalagon the Black, who could have harmed the  One  Ring,  the Ruling Ring, for  that was  made by Sauron himself. There is only  one  way:  to  find  the  Cracks  of Doom in  the  depths  of Orodruin,  the  Fire-mountain, and cast the Ring in there, if you really wish to destroy it,  to put it beyond the grasp of the Enemy for ever.'       'I do  really wish to destroy it!'  cried Frodo. 'Or,  well, to have it  destroyed. I am not  made for perilous  quests. I wish  I had never seen the  Ring! Why did it come to me? Why was I chosen?'   ####-     'Such questions cannot be  answered,'  said Gandalf.  'You may be  sure  that it was not  for any merit that others do not possess: not for  power or   wisdom,  at any rate. But you have been chosen, and you  must therefore  use  such strength and heart and wits as you have.'       'But I  have so  little of any  of  these  things!  You  are  wise  and  powerful. Will you not take the Ring?'       'No!' cried Gandalf, springing  to  his feet. 'With that power I should  have power too great and terrible. And over me the Ring  would  gain a power   still greater and more deadly.' His eyes flashed and his face  was lit as by  a fire within.  'Do not tempt me! For I do not  wish to become like the  Dark  Lord  himself. Yet the  way of the  Ring  to  my heart is by pity, pity  for   weakness and the desire of strength to do good. Do  not tempt me! I dare not   take it, not even to keep it safe, unused. The wish to wield it would be too  great, for my  strength.  I shall  have  such  need of it. Great  perils lie  before me.'       He  went to the  window and drew aside the curtains  and the  shutters.   Sunlight  streamed  back again into  the  room. Sam   passed  along the  path   outside whistling. 'And now,'  said  the wizard, turning back to Frodo, 'the  decision lies with you. But  I will always  help you.' He  laid his hand  on  Frodo's shoulder. 'I will help you bear this  burden, as long as It is yours  to bear. But we must do something, soon. The Enemy is moving.'       There was a long  silence.  Gandalf  sat down again and puffed  at  his  pipe, as if lost in thought. His eyes  seemed closed, but under the  lids he  was watching Frodo  intently. Frodo  gazed fixedly at the red embers on  the  hearth,  until they filled all his vision,  and he seemed to be looking down  into  profound  wells of fire."
