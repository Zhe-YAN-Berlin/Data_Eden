  "text": " No other blade, not  though  mightier hands had wielded it, would have dealt that foe a wound  so bitter,  cleaving the undead flesh, breaking the spell that knit his unseen sinews to  his will.       Men now raised the  king, and laying cloaks upon  spear -truncheons they  made shift to bear him away towards the City; and others lifted Jowyn gently  up and bore her after him.  But  the  men of the king's household they could  not yet bring from  the  field; for seven of the king's knights  had  fallen  there, and Djorwine their chief was among them. So they laid them apart from  their foes and the fell beast and set spears about them. And afterwards when  all was over men returned  and  made a fire there  and burned the carcase of  the beast; but for Snowmane  they dug a grave and set up a stone  upon which  was carved in the tongues of Gondor and the Mark:       Faithful servant yet master's bane       Lightfoot's foal, swift Snowmane.       Green and long  grew the grass  on  Snowmane's Howe, but ever black and  bare was the ground where the beast was burned.       Now slowly and sadly Merry  walked beside the bearers,  and he gave  no  more  heed to  the battle.  He was weary and  full  of  pain, and  his limbs  trembled as  with  a chill. A great  rain came out of the Sea, and it seemed  that all things wept for Thjoden and  Jowyn, quenching the fires in the City  with grey tears.  It was through a mist that presently he saw the van of the  men of Gondor  approaching. Imrahil,  Prince of Dol Amroth, rode up and  drew  rein before them.       'What burden do you bear, Men of Rohan?' he cried.       'Thjoden King,' they answered. 'He is dead. But Jomer King now rides in   the battle: he with the white crest in the wind.'   ####-     Then the prince went from his horse, and knelt by the bier in honour of  the  king and  his  great onset; and  he wept. And  rising he looked then on  Jowyn and  was amazed. 'Surely,  here  is a  woman?' he said. 'Have even the  women of the Rohirrim come to war in our need?'       'Nay!  One only,'  they  answered.  'The Lady Jowyn is  she, sister  of  Jomer; and we knew naught of her riding  until this hour, and greatly we rue  it.'       Then the prince seeing her beauty, though her face  was pale  and cold,  touched her hand as he bent to look more  closely on her. 'Men of Rohan!' he  cried. 'Are there no leeches among you? She is hurt to the death  maybe, but  I deem that  she yet lives.' And  he held the bright-burnished vambrace that  was upon his arm before her cold tips, and behold! a little mist was laid on  it hardly to be seen.       'Haste now is needed,'  he said, and he sent one riding back swiftly to  the City to bring aid. But he bowing low to the fallen, bade  them farewell,  and mounting rode away into battle.       And now  the  fighting waxed furious on the fields of the Pelennor; and  the din of arms rose upon  high, with  the crying of men and the neighing of  horses. Horns were blown  and trumpets  were  braying, and  the mymakil were  bellowing as they  were goaded to war. Under the south walls of the City the   footmen of Gondor now  drove against the legions  of Morgul that were  still   gathered there in strength. But the horsemen rode eastward to the succour of  Jomer:  HÂ®rin the Tall Warden of  the Keys, and the Lord of  Lossarnach, and  Hirluin of the Green Hills, and Prince Imrahil the fair with his knights all  about him.       Not too  soon came  their  aid to  the Rohirrim; for fortune had turned  against Jomer,  and his fury had betrayed him.  The great wrath of his onset  had  utterly  overthrown the front of  his enemies, and  great wedges of his  Riders had passed clear through  the ranks of  the   Southrons,  discomfiting  their  horsemen and riding their footmen to ruin.  But  wherever the mymakil  came  there the horses would not go, but  blenched and swerved away; and the  great  monsters were  unfought, and  stood  like towers of defence,  and the  Haradrim rallied about them. And if the Rohirrim at  their onset were thrice  outnumbered by  the Haradrim alone,  soon their case  became  worse; for new  strength came  now streaming to the field  out of  Osgiliath. There they had  been mustered for the sack of  the City and the rape of Gondor,  waiting  on   the call of their Captain. He  now was destroyed; but Gothmog the lieutenant   ####-of  Morgul had flung them into the fray; Easterlings  with axes, and Variags  of  Khand. Southrons  in  scarlet, and  out  of  Far  Harad  black  men  like  half-trolls with white eyes and red tongues. Some now hastened up behind the  Rohirrim, others  held westward to hold off the forces of Gondor and prevent  their joining with Rohan.       It was even as the day thus began to turn against Gondor and their hope  wavered that a new cry went up in the City, it being  then midmorning, and a  great wind blowing,  and the rain flying north, and the sun shining. In that  clear air watchmen on the walls saw afar a new sight of fear, and their last  hope left them."
