And looking thither they cried  in   dismay; for black against the glittering stream they beheld a fleet borne up  on the wind: dromunds, and  ships  of great draught with many oars, and with  black sails bellying in the breeze.       'The Corsairs of Umbar!' men shouted. 'The Corsairs of Umbar! Look! The  Corsairs of Umbar  are  coming!  So  Belfalas is  taken, and the  Ethir, and  Lebennin is gone. The Corsairs are upon us! It is the last stroke of doom!'       And some without order, for none could he found to command them  in the  City,  ran to  the bells and tolled the alarm;  and  some blew the  trumpets  sounding the retreat. 'Back to the walls!' they  cried. 'Back to the  walls!   Come back to the City before all are overwhelmed!' But the  wind  that  sped  the ships blew all their clamour away.       The Rohirrim indeed had no  need  of news or  alarm.  All too well they  could  see for themselves the black sails. For Jomer was now scarcely a mile   from the Harlond, and a great press of  his first  foes was between  him and  the haven  there, while new  foes came swirling behind, cutting him off from  the Prince. Now he looked to the River,  and hope died in his heart, and the  wind  that he had blessed  he  now  called accursed. But the hosts of Mordor   were enheartened, and filled  with a new lust  and fury they came yelling to  the onset.       Stern now  was Jomer's mood, and  his mind clear again. He let blow the  horns to rally all men to his banner that could come thither; for he thought  to make a great shield-wall at the last, and stand, and  fight there on foot  till all fell, and do deeds of song on the fields of Pelennor, though no man  should be left in the West to remember the last King of the Mark. So he rode    ####-to  a green hillock and  there  set  his banner,  and  the  White Horse  ran  rippling in the wind.       Out of doubt, out of dark to the day's rising       I came singing in the sun, sword unsheathing.       To hope's end I rode and to heart's breaking:       Now for wrath, now for ruin and a red nightfall!       These staves  he spoke, yet he laughed as  he  said them. For once more  lust of battle was on him; and he was still unscathed, and he was young, and  he was king:  the  lord  of a  fell  people. And lo! even  as he  laughed at  despair he looked  out  again on the black ships, and he lifted up his sword  to defy them.       And then wonder took him, and a great joy; and he cast  his sword up in  the sunlight  and sang as he caught it. And all eyes followed his gaze,  and  behold!  upon  the  foremost  ship  a great  standard  broke,  and the  wind  displayed it as she turned towards the Harlond. There flowered a White Tree,  and that  was for Gondor; but Seven Stars were  about it,  and  a high crown  above it,  the  signs of  Elendil  that no lord had  borne  for years beyond  count. And the  stars flamed in the  sunlight, for they were wrought of gems  by Arwen daughter of Elrond; and the crown was bright in the morning, for it  was wrought of mithril and gold.       Thus came Aragorn son of Arathorn, Elessar, Isildur's heir, out  of the  Paths of the Dead, borne upon a wind from the Sea to the  kingdom of Gondor;  and the mirth  of the Rohirrim was a  torrent  of laughter and a flashing of  swords, and the  joy and wonder of the  City  was a music of trumpets and  a   ringing of bells. But the hosts of Mordor wer e seized with bewilderment, and  a  great  wizardry  it seemed to  them that their own ships should be filled  with their foes; and a black dread  fell on them, knowing  that the tides of  fate had turned against them and their doom was at hand.       East rode the  knights of  Dol Amroth driving the  enemy  before  them:  troll-men and Variags  and orcs that hated  the sunlight. South strode Jomer   and men fled  before his face, and  they were caught between the  hammer and  the anvil. For now men leaped from the ships to the quays of the Harlond and  swept north like  a storm. There  came Legolas, and  Gimli wielding his axe,  and Halbarad with the standard, and Elladan  and Elrohir with stars on their  brow,  and the  dour-handed D®nedain, Rangers of the North,  leading a great  valour of the folk of Lebennin  and Lamedon and  the fiefs of the South. But  before all went Aragorn with the Flame of the West, And®ril  like a new fire   ####-kindled, Narsil  re-forged  as deadly as of old: and upon his  brow  was the  Star of Elendil.       And so at length Jomer and Aragorn met in  the midst of the battle, and  they leaned on their swords and looked on one another and were glad.       'Thus we  meet again, though  all the hosts of Mordor lay between  us,'  said Aragorn. 'Did I not say so at the Hornburg?'       'So you spoke,' said Jomer, 'but hope oft deceives, and I knew not then  that you were a man foresighted."
