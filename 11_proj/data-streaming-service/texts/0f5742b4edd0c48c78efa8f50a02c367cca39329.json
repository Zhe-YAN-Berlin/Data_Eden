I  am but the heir of Isildur, not Isildur himself. I  have had  a hard life  and a long; and  the  leagues that lie between here and  Gondor are a  small  part  in the count of my journeys.  I have crossed many mountains  and  many  rivers, and trodden  many  plains, even  into the far  countries of Rhyn and  Harad where the stars are strange.       'But my home, such  as I have, is in the  North. For  here the heirs of  Valandil have ever dwelt in long line unbroken from father unto son for many  generations.  Our days have darkened,  and  we  have dwindled; but ever  the  Sword has passed to a new keeper. And this I will say to you, Boromir, ere I   end.  Lonely  men are we, Rangers of  the wild, hunters--but hunters ever of  the servants  of the Enemy; for they are found in many places, not in Mordor  only.       `If Gondor, Boromir, has been a stalwart tower, we  have played another   part. Many evil things there are that your strong walls and bright swords do  not  stay. You  know  little  of the  lands beyond  your  bounds.  Peace and  freedom, do you say? The North would have known them little but for us. Fear  would  have destroyed them.  But when dark  things come  from the  houseless  hills, or creep from sunless  woods,  they fly from us. What roads would any  dare to tread, what safety would there be in quiet lands, or in the homes of  simple men at night, if the DÂ®nedain were asleep, or were all gone into  the  grave?        `And yet less  thanks  have  we than you. Travellers  scowl at  us, and  countrymen give us  scornful names. \"Strider\"  I am to one fat man who lives  within a day's march  of foes that would  freeze his heart or lay his little  town in ruin, if he were not guarded ceaselessly. Yet we would  not have  it  otherwise. If simple folk are free from care and fear, simple  they will be,  and we must be secret to keep them so. That has been the task of my kindred,  while the years have lengthened and the grass has grown.       `But now  the world is changing once again. A new hour comes. Isildur's  Bane is found. Battle is at hand. The Sword  shall be reforged. I  will come  to Minas Tirith.'       `Isildur's Bane is found, you say,' said Boromir. `I have seen a bright  ring in the Halfling's hand; but Isildur perished ere this  age of the world  began, they say. How do  the Wise know that this ring is his? And how has it  passed  down  the  years,  until  it  is  brought  hither  by so  strange  a    ####-messenger?'       `That shall be told,' said Elrond.       `But not  yet, I beg, Master!' said Bilbo. `Already the Sun is climbing  to noon, and I feel the need of something to strengthen me.'       `I  had  not named you,' said Elrond  smiling. `But I do so now.  Come!   Tell us your tale. And if you have  not yet cast your story  into verse, you   may tell it in plain words. The briefer, the sooner shall you be refreshed.'       `Very well,' said Bilbo. `I will do as you bid. But I will now tell the  true story, and  if some here have heard  me tell it otherwise'  -- he looked  sidelong at Gluin -- `I ask them to forget it  and forgive me. I only wished  to claim the treasure  as my very own  in those days, and to be rid  of  the  name of thief that was put on me. But  perhaps I understand things a  little  better now. Anyway, this is what happened.'       To  some there  Bilbo's tale was  wholly  new, and they  listened  with  amazement while  the old  hobbit, actually not  at all displeased, recounted  his  adventure with Gollum, at full length. He did not omit a single riddle.  He would have given also  an account of his party and disappearance from the  Shire, if he had been allowed; but Elrond raised his hand.       'Well told, my friend,' he said, `but that  is enough at this time. For   the moment it suffices to know that the Ring passed to Frodo, your heir. Let   him now speak!'       Then, less willingly  than Bilbo, Frodo  told of all his  dealings with  the  Ring from the day that  it passed  into his keeping. Every step  of his  journey from Hobbiton to the Ford  of Bruinen was questioned and considered,  and  everything  that  he  could  recall  concerning  the  Black Riders  was  examined. At last he sat down again.       `Not bad,' Bilbo said to him. `You  would have made a good story of it,  if they hadn't kept  on interrupting. I tried to  make  a few notes,  but we  shall have to  go  over it all again together some time, if I am to write it  up. There are whole chapters of stuff before you ever got here!'       `Yes, it made quite a long tale,' answered Frodo. 'But  the story still  does not seem complete to  me.  I still want to know a good deal, especially  about Gandalf.'       Galdor of the Havens, who sat near by, overheard him. `You speak for me  also,'  he cried, and  turning  to  Elrond he  said: `The Wise may have good  reason to believe that the halfling's trove is indeed the Great Ring of long  debate, unlikely though that may seem to those who know less."
