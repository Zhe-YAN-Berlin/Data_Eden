The night of the battle, Sandor Clegane had come to her chambers to take her from the city, but Sansa had refused. Sometimes she lay awake at night, wondering if she’d been wise. She had his stained white cloak hidden in a cedar chest beneath her summer silks. She could not say why she’d kept it. The Hound had turned craven, she heard it said; at the height of the battle, he got so drunk the Imp had to take his men. But Sansa understood. She knew the secret of his burned face. It was only the fire he feared. That night, the wildfire had set the river itself ablaze, and filled the very air with green flame. Even in the castle, Sansa had been afraid. Outside… she could scarcely imagine it.  Sighing, she got out quill and ink, and wrote Margaery Tyrell a gracious note of acceptance.  When the appointed night arrived, another of the Kingsguard came for her, a man as different from Sandor Clegane as… well, as a flower from a dog. The sight of Ser Loras Tyrell standing on her threshold made Sansa’s heart beat a little faster. This was the first time she had been so close to him since he had returned to King’s Landing, leading the vanguard of his father’s host. For a moment she did not know what to say.  Ser Loras,  she finally managed,  you… you look so lovely.   He gave her a puzzled smile.  My lady is too kind. And beautiful besides. My sister awaits you eagerly.    I have so looked forward to our supper.    As has Margaery, and my lady grandmother as well.  He took her arm and led her toward the steps.   Your grandmother?  Sansa was finding it hard to walk and talk and think all at the same time, with Ser Loras touching her arm. She could feel the warmth of his hand through the silk.   Lady Olenna. She is to sup with you as well.    Oh,  said Sansa. I am talking to him, and he’s touching me, he’s holding my arm and touching me.  The Queen of Thorns, she’s called. Isn’t that right?    It is.  Ser Loras laughed. He has the warmest laugh, she thought as he went on,  You’d best not use that name in her presence, though, or you’re like to get pricked.   Sansa reddened. Any fool would have realized that no woman would be happy about being called  the Queen of Thorns.  Maybe I truly am as stupid as Cersei Lannister says. Desperately she tried to think of something clever and charming to say to him, but her wits had deserted her. She almost told him how beautiful he was, until she remembered that she’d already done that.  He was beautiful, though. He seemed taller than he’d been when she’d first met him, but still so lithe and graceful, and Sansa had never seen another boy with such wonderful eyes. He’s no boy, though, he’s a man grown, a knight of the Kingsguard. She thought he looked even finer in white than in the greens and golds of House Tyrell. The only spot of color on him now was the brooch that clasped his cloak; the rose of Highgarden wrought in soft yellow gold, nestled in a bed of delicate green jade leaves.  Ser Balon Swann held the door of Maegor’s for them to pass. He was all in white as well, though he did not wear it half so well as Ser Loras. Beyond the spiked moat, two dozen men were taking their practice with sword and shield. With the castle so crowded, the outer ward had been given over to guests to raise their tents and pavilions, leaving only the smaller inner yards for training. One of the Redwyne twins was being driven backward by Ser Tallad, with the eyes on his shield. Chunky Ser Kennos of Kayce, who chuffed and puffed every time he raised his longsword, seemed to be holding his own against Osney Kettleblack, but Osney’s brother Ser Osfryd was savagely punishing the frog-faced squire Morros Slynt. Blunted swords or no, Slynt would have a rich crop of bruises by the morrow. It made Sansa wince just to watch. They have scarcely finished burying the dead from the last battle, and already they are practicing for the next one.  On the edge of the yard, a lone knight with a pair of golden roses on his shield was holding off three foes. Even as they watched, he caught one of them alongside the head, knocking him senseless.  Is that your brother?  Sansa asked.   It is, my lady,  said Ser Loras.  Garlan often trains against three men, or even four. In battle it is seldom one against one, he says, so he likes to be prepared.    He must be very brave.    He is a great knight,  Ser Loras replied.  A better sword than me, in truth, though I’m the better lance.    I remember,  said Sansa.  You ride wonderfully, ser.    My lady is gracious to say so. When has she seen me ride?    At the Hand’s tourney, don’t you remember? You rode a white courser, and your armor was a hundred different kinds of flowers. You gave me a rose. A red rose. You threw white roses to the other girls that day.  It made her flush to speak of it.  You said no victory was half as beautiful as me."
