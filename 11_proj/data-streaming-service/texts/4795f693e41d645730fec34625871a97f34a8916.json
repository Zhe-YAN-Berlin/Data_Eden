'For this  is not the first  halfling that  I  have seen  walking out of northern legends into the Southlands.'       At that Gandalf sat up and gripped the arms of his chair;  but  he said  nothing, and  with a look stopped the exclamation on Pippin's lips. Denethor   looked at their faces  and  nodded his head, as though  in sign  that he had  read much  there before it  was spoken. Slowly, while the  others sat silent  and  still,  Faramir  told  his tale, with  his  eyes  for the most part  on  Gandalf, though now and again his glance strayed to Pippin, as if to refresh  his memory of others that he had seen.       As his story was unfolded of his meeting with Frodo and his servant and  of  the events  at Henneth  Annyn, Pippin became aware that  Gandalf's hands  were  trembling as they clutched the carven wood. White they seemed now   and  very old,  and as  he looked at them,  suddenly with a thrill of fear Pippin  knew  that Gandalf, Gandalf himself, was troubled, even afraid.  The  air of  the room was close and still. At last when Faramir spoke of his parting with   the travellers, and of their resolve to go to Cirith Ungol,  his voice fell,  and he shook his head and sighed. Then Gandalf sprang up.       'Cirith Ungol?  Morgul Vale?'  he said. 'The  time,  Faramir, the time?   When did you part with them? When would they reach that accursed valley?'       'I parted with them in  the morning two days ago,' said Faramir. 'It is  fifteen leagues thence to the vale  of the Morgulduin, if they went straight  south; and then they would  be  still five leagu es westward of  the accursed  Tower.  At  swiftest they could not come  there before today, and maybe they  have not come there yet. Indeed I see what you fear. But the darkness is not  due to their venture.  It began yestereve, and all Ithilien was under sha dow  last night.  It is clear to me that the Enemy has long planned an assault on  us, and its hour had already been determined before ever the travellers left  my keeping.'   ####-     Gandalf paced the floor. 'The  morning  of two days ago,  nigh on three  days of journey! How far is the place where you parted?'       'Some  twenty-five leagues as a  bird flies,' answered  Faramir. 'But I  could not  come more swiftly.  Yestereve I lay at Cair Andros, the long isle  in the River  northward which we hold in defence; and horses are kept on the  hither bank. As the dark drew on I  knew that  haste was  needed,  so I rode  thence with three others that could also be horsed. The rest of my company I   sent south to strengthen the garrison at the fords of Osgiliath. I hope that  I have not done ill?' He looked at his father.       'Ill?' cried Denethor,  and his eyes flashed suddenly. 'Why do you ask?  The men were under your command. Or do you ask for my  judgement on all  your  deeds? Your bearing is lowly in my presence,  yet it is long  now  since you   turned from your own way at my counsel. See, you have  spoken  skilfully, as  ever; but  I, have I not seen your  eye fixed on Mithrandir, seeking whether   you said well or too much? He has long had your heart in his keeping.       'My son, your  father is old but not yet dotard. I can see and hear, as  was  my wont; and  little of what you have half said  or left unsaid  is now  hidden from me. I know the answer to many riddles. Alas, alas for Boromir!'       'If what I have done  displeases you, my father,' said Faramir quietly,  'I wish I had known your counsel before the burden of so weighty a judgement  was thrust on me.'       'Would that have availed to change your judgement?' said Denethor. 'You  would still have done just so, I deem.  I k now you well. Ever your desire is  to  appear lordly and generous as  a king of old, gracious, gentle. That may  well befit one of high race, if he sits in power and peace. But in desperate  hours gentleness may be repaid with death.'       'So be it,' said Faramir.       'So  be  it!' cried  Denethor.  'But  not  with your  death  only, Lord  Faramir: with the death also of your father, and of all your people, whom it  is your part to protect now that Boromir is gone.'       'Do you wish then,' said Faramir, 'that our places had been exchanged?'       'Yes,  I wish that indeed,' said Denethor. 'For Boromir was loyal to me  and no wizard's pupil. He would have remembered his father's need, and would  not  have squandered what  fortune gave.  He would have brought me  a  mighty  gift.'       For a moment Faramir's restraint gave way. 'I would ask you, my father,   ####-to remember why it was that I,  not he, was in Ithilien. On  one occasion at  least your counsel has prevailed, not long ago. It  was the Lord of the City  that gave the errand to him.'       'Stir not the  bitterness in  the cup that  I mixed  for myself,'  said  Denethor.  'Have I  not tasted it now  many nights upon my tongue foreboding  that worse yet lay in the dregs? As now indeed I find."
