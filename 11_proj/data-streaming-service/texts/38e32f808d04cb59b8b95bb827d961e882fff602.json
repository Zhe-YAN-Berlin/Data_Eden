  "text": "  Treebeard  did   not  talk  to  them.  He   hummed  to  himself  deeply  and  thoughtfully,  but Merry and Pippin caught no proper words: it sounded  like  boom, boom, rumboom, boorar, boom, boom, dahrar boom boom, dahrar  boom,  and  so on with  a constant change of note and rhythm. Now and again they thought  they heard an answer, a hum or a quiver of sound, that seemed  to come out of  the earth, or  from boughs above  their heads, or perhaps  from the boles of   ####-the trees; but Treebeard did not stop or turn his head to either side.       They had been going for a  long while  -- Pippin had tried to keep count  of the 'ent-strides' but had failed, getting lost at about three thousand --  when  Treebeard  began to  slacken his pace. Suddenly he  stopped,  put  the  hobbits down, and raised his curled  hands to his mouth so that they  made a   hollow tube; then he blew or called through them. A great hoom, hom rang out  like a deep-throated horn in the woods, and seemed  to echo  from the trees.   Far off there came from  several directions  a similar  hoom, hom, hoom that  was not an echo but an answer.       Treebeard  now perched Merry and Pippin on his shoulders  and strode on  again, every now and then sending out another horn-call,  and each time  the  answers came louder and nearer. In this way they came at last to what looked  like an impenetrable  wall of dark evergreen trees, trees of a kind that the  hobbits had never seen  before:  they branched out right from the roots, and  were densely clad in dark glossy leaves like thornless holly, and  they bore  many stiff upright flower -spikes with large shining olive-coloured buds.        Turning to the  left and skirting this huge hedge  Treebeard  came in a   few strides to a  narrow entrance. Through it a  worn path passed  and dived  suddenly down  a long steep slope. The hobbits saw that they were descending  into a great  dingle, almost as round as a bowl, very wide and deep, crowned   at the rim with the high dark evergreen hedge. It  was smooth and  grassclad  inside,  and  there were no  trees  except  three  very tall  and  beautiful  silver -birches that stood at the  bottom  of the bowl.  Two  other paths led  down into the dingle: from the west and from the east.       Several Ents had already arrived.  More were coming  in down the  other   paths, and  some were now following Treebeard. As they drew near the hobbits  gazed  at them.  They had expected to see a number of creatures as much like  Treebeard as  one hobbit is like another (at any  rate to a stranger's eye);  and they were very much surprised to see nothing of the  kind. The Ents were  as different from  one another as trees from trees: some as different as one  tree  is  from  another of the  same  name  but  quite  different growth and  history; and some as different  as one tree-kind from another, as birch from  beech; oak from fir. There were a few older Ents,  bearded and gnarled  like  hale  but  ancient trees (though none looked  as ancient as Treebeard);  and  there   were  tall  strong  Ents,   clean-limbed  and  smooth-skinned   like  forest -trees  in  their  prime; but  there were no young Ents, no  saplings.  Altogether there were about two  dozen standing on the wide grassy  floor of   ####-the dingle, and as many more were marching in.       At first Merry and Pippin were struck chiefly by the variety  that they  saw: the many shapes, and colours, the differences in girth; and height, and  length of leg and arm; and in the number of toes  and fingers (anything from  three to nine). A few seemed more or less related to Treebeard, and reminded  them of beech-trees  or oaks. But  there were other kinds. Some recalled the  chestnut: brown-skinned Ents with large splayfingered hands, and short thick  legs. Some recalled  the  ash:  tall straight grey  Ents  with many-fingered  hands and long legs; some  the fir (the tallest Ents), and others the birch,  the  rowan, and the linden.  But when the Ents all gather ed round Treebeard,  bowing their  heads  slightly, murmuring in  their  slow musical voices, and  looking long  and intently at the strangers, then the hobbits saw  that they  were all of the same kindred, and all had  the same eyes: not all so old  or   so  deep  as Treebeard's,  but  all  with the  same slow, steady, thoughtful  expression, and the same green flicker.       As soon as the  whole company was assembled,  standing in a wide circle   round  Treebeard, a curious and unintelligible conversation began.  The Ents  began to murmur slowly: first  one joined and then  another, until they were  all chanting together in a long rising and falling rhythm, now louder on one  side  of  the ring, now dying away there and rising to a great boom  on  the  other  side. Though he could not catch or  understand any of the words  -- he  supposed the language was Entish  -- Pippin found the  sound very pleasant to  listen to at first;  but gradually his attention wavered."
