I  am sorry; for the trees  were   ####-beautiful, and had stood so long.'       `I felt that  something horrible was near from  the moment that my foot  first  touched the water,'  said Frodo. 'What  was the  thing, or were there  many of them? '       'I do not know,' answered Gandalf, 'but the arms were all guided by one  purpose.  Something has  crept, or has  been driven out of dark waters under   the mountains.  There  are  older and  fouler things  than  Orcs in the deep  places of  the world.'  He did not speak aloud his thought that whatever  it  was  that dwelt  in the lake, it had  seized  on Frodo  first among  all the  Company.       Boromir muttered under  his breath, but the echoing stone magnified the  sound to a  hoarse  whisper  that all could hear: `In the deep places of the  world!  And thither we are going against my wish.  Who will lead  us  now in  this deadly dark? '       'I will,' said Gandalf, 'and Gimli shall walk with me. Follow my staff!   '       As  the wizard passed  on ahead up  the great steps, he held  his staff  aloft, and from its tip there came  a faint radiance. The wide  stairway was  sound and undamaged. Two hundred steps they counted, broad and shallow;   and  at the top they found  an arched  passage with  a level floor leading on into  the dark.       `Let us  sit and rest and  have  something to eat, here on the landing,  since  we can't find a dining-room! ' said  Frodo. He had begun to shake off  the terror of the clutching arm, and suddenly he felt extremely hungry.       The proposal was welcomed by all; and they sat down on the upper steps,   dim figures  in the gloom. After they had eaten,  Gandalf gave  them each  a   third sip of the miruvor of Rivendell.       `It will not last much longer, I am  afraid,' he said; 'but I  think we  need it after that horror at  the gate. And unless we have  great  luck,  we  shall need all that is left before we see the other side! Go  carefully with  the water, too!  There are  many streams  and wells in  the Mines,  but they  should not be touched. We  may  not  have a chance of filling  our skins and  bottles till we come down into Dimrill Dale.'       'How long is that going to take us? ' asked Frodo.       'I  cannot  say,'  answered Gandalf.  'It depends  on many chances. But  going straight,  without mishap  or  losing our  way, we shall take three or    ####-four marches, I expect. It cannot be less than forty miles from West -door to  East -gate in a direct line, and the road may wind much.'       After only a brief rest they started on their way again. All were eager   to  get the journey over as quickly  as possible, and were willing, tired as  they  were, to go on  marching  still for  several hours. Gandalf  walked in  front as before. In his left hand he held up his glimmering staff, the light  of which just showed the ground before  his feet; in his right he  held  his  sword Glamdring.  Behind him came Gimli, his eyes glinting in  the dim light  as he turned his head from side to side. Behind the dwarf  walked Frodo, and  he had drawn the short sword, Sting. No gleam came from the blades of  Sting  or of  Glamdring;  and  that was some comfort, for being the work of  Elvish  smiths in  the Elder  Days these swords shone with a cold light, if any Orcs  were near  at hand. Behind Frodo went Sam, and after  him  Legolas,  and the  young hobbits, and Boromir. In the dark at the rear, grim and silent, walked  Aragorn.       The passage  twisted  round a few  turns, and then began to descend. It  went steadily down for  a long while before it became level once again.  The   air grew  hot and  stifling, but  it was  not  foul, and at times they  felt  currents of cooler air upon  their faces, issuing from half-guessed openings  in the walls.  There  were  many of  these. In the  pale ray of the wizard's  staff, Frodo caught glimpses of stairs and arches and of  other passages and  tunnels, sloping  up,  or  running steeply down, or opening  blankly dark on  either side. It was bewildering beyond hope of remembering.       Gimli aided Gandalf very little, except by h is stout  courage. At least   he  was not,  as  were most of the  others, troubled by the mere darkness in  itself. Often the wizard consulted him at points where the choice of way was  doubtful; but it was  always  Gandalf who had the final word. The  Mines  of  Moria were vast and intricate beyond the imagination  of Gimli, Gluin's son,   dwarf of the mountain-race though he was. To Gandalf the far -off memories of  a  journey long  before were now of little help, but  even  in the gloom and  despite all windings of the road he knew whither he wished to go, and he did  not falter, as long as there was a path that led towards his goal.       `Do not be afraid! ' said Aragorn. There was a pause longer than usual,  and Gandalf and Gimli were  whispering  together; the  others  were  crowded  behind, waiting anxiously."
