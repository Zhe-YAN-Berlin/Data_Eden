  "text": " Slain, if he be not taken very swiftly. But how can  this slippery  thing of many guises be caught, save by a feathered shaft?  '       `Let me go  down quietly to him,' said Frodo. `You  may keep  your bows  bent, and shoot me at least, if I fail. I shall not run away.'       `Go  then and be swift! ' said Faramir. `If  he  comes  off  alive,  he  should be your faithful servant for the rest of his unhappy days. Lead Frodo   down to the bank, Anborn, and go softly. The thing has a nose and ears. Give  me your bow.'       Anborn grunted and led the way down the winding  sta ir to the  landing,  and then up the other stair, until  at  last they  came to a narrow  opening  shrouded with thick bushes. Passing silently through, Frodo found himself on  the top of  the southern bank above the pool. It  was now dark and the falls  were  pale and grey,  reflecting only the lingering moonlight of the western  sky. He could not see Gollum. He went forward  a  short way and Anborn   came  softly behind him.       `Go on!  ' he breathed in  Frodo's ear.  `Have a care to your right. If  you  fall in the pool, then no one but your fishing friend can help you. And  forget not that there are bowmen near at hand, though you may not see them.'   ####-     Frodo crept forward, using his hands Gollum-like to feel his way and to  steady himself.  The rocks  were  for  the  most part  flat  and smooth  but  slippery.  He halted listening.  At first he  could  hear  no sound but  the  unceasing  rush of  the  fall behind him. Then presently he  heard,  not far  ahead, a hissing murmur.       'Fissh, nice fissh. White Face has vanished, my precious, at last, yes.   Now we can eat fish in  peace. No, not in peace,  precious. For Precious  is  lost; yes, lost. Dirty hobbits, nasty hobbits. Gone and left us, gollum; and  Precious is gone.  Only poor  Smjagol all  alone.  No Preciou s.  Nasty  Men,   they'll  take  it,  steal my Precious. Thieves.  We  hates them. Fissh, nice  fissh: Makes  us  strong.  Makes eyes bright,  fingers  tight, yes. Throttle  them, precious. Throttle them all, yes, if we gets chances. Nice fissh. Nice  fissh!  '       So it went on, almost as unceasing as the waterfall,  only  interrupted  by  a faint noise of slavering and gurgling. Frodo  shivered, listening with  pity and disgust. He wished it would stop, and that he  never need hear that  voice again. Anborn  was  not far behind. He  could creep back and ask him to  get the huntsmen  to shoot.  They  would probably get  close  enough,  while  Gollum was gorging and off his guard. Only one true shot, and Frodo would be  rid of the miserable voice  for ever. But no, Gollum had a claim on him now.  The  servant has a  claim on the master  for service, even  service in fear.  They  would have foundered  in the Dead Marshes but for  Gollum. Frodo  knew,  too, somehow, quite clearly that Gandalf would not have wished it.       `Smjagol! ' he said softly.       `Fissh, nice fissh,' said the voice.       `Smjagol! ' he said, a little louder. The voice stopped.       `Smjagol,  Master  has come to  look  for  you. Master  is here.  Come,  Smjagol! ' There was no answer but a soft hiss, as of intaken breath.       'Come, Smjagol! ' said Frodo. `We are in danger.  Men will kill you, if  they find  you  here. Come quickly, if you  wish  to escape  death.  Come to  Master!'       'No!' said the  voice.  `Not nice Master. Leaves  poor Smjagol and goes  with new friends. Master can wait. Smjagol hasn't finished.'       `There's no time,' said Frodo. `Bring fish with you. Come! '       `No! Must finish fish.'       'Smjagol! ' said Frodo desperately. 'Precious  will be angry.  I  shall   ####-take Precious, and I shall say: make  him swallow the bones and choke. Never   taste fish again. Come, Precious is waiting! '       There  was  a sharp  hiss.  Presently  out of  the darkness Gollum came  crawling  on all  fours,  like  an  erring  dog  called  to  heel. He had   a  half-eaten fish  in  his  mouth  and another  in his hand. He came  close to  Frodo, almost nose to nose, and sniffed at him.  His pale eyes were shining.  Then he took the fish out of his mouth and stood up.       `Nice Master! ' he whispered. `Nice  hobb it, come back to poor Smjagol.  Good Smjagol comes. Now let's go, go quickly, yes. Through the  trees, while  the Faces are dark. Yes, come let's go! '       `Yes,  we'll go soon,' said Frodo. `But not at once. I will go with you   as  I promised. I promise aga in.  But  not now. You are not safe yet. I will   save you, but you must trust me.'       `We  must trust  Master? ' said Gollum doubtfully.  'Why? Why not go at  once? Where is the other one, the cross rude hobbit? Where is he?'       'Away up there,' said Frodo, pointing to the waterfall. 'I am not going  without him. We must go back to him.' His heart sank. This was too much like  trickery.  He did not  really fear that  Faramir would allow  Gollum  to  be  killed, but  he would probably make him prisoner and bind him; and certainly  what Frodo did would seem a treachery to  the poor  treacherous creature."
