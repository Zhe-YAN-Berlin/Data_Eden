They  passed the hours  of  night  in  wakefulness  and they were aware  of many things  half-seen  that  walked and prowled all about them, and they heard the howling of wolves. The  wind had  died  and all  the air  seemed still. They  could see  little, for   though it was cloudless and the waxing moon was four nights  old, there were  smokes  and  fumes  that rose  out of the earth and  the white  crescent was  shrouded in the mists of Mordor.       It grew cold. As morning came the wind bega n to stir again,  but now it  came from  the North,  and  soon it  freshened to a  rising breeze. All  the  night-walkers were gone, and the land seemed empty. North amid their  noisome  pits lay the first of the great heaps and hills of slag and broken  rock and  blasted earth,  the vomit of the maggot-folk of Mordor;  but south  and  now  near loomed the great rampart of Cirith Gorgor, and the Black Gate amidmost,  and the two Towers of the Teeth tall and dark upon either side. For in their  last march  the Capta ins had turned away from the old road as it  bent east,   and avoided the peril of the lurking hills, and so now they were approaching  the Morannon from the north-west, even as Frodo had done.       The two  vast iron doors of the Black Gate under its frowning arch were  fast closed. Upon the battlement nothing could be seen. All was  silent  but  watchful. They  were come to the last end of their folly, and stood  forlorn  and chill in the grey light of early day before towers and walls which their  army could not assault with hope, not even if it had brought thither engines  of great power, and  the Enemy had no more force than would suffice  for the  manning of  the gate  and wall alone. Yet  they  knew that all the hills and   ####-rocks  about  the Morannon  were filled with hidden  foes, and  the  shadowy  defile beyond was bored and tunnelled  by teeming broods of evil things. And  as they stood they saw all the Nazgyl gathered together, hovering  above the  Towers of the Teeth like vultures; and they knew that they were watched. But  still the Enemy made no sign.       No  choice was left them but to play their part  to  its end. Therefore  Aragorn now set the host in such array as could  best be contrived; and they   were drawn up on two great  hills of blasted stone and earth  that orcs  had  piled in years of labour. Before them towards Mordor lay like a moat a great  mire  of  reeking  mud and foul-smelling  pools. When all  was  ordered, the  Captains rode  forth towards the Black Gate with  a great  guard of horsemen  and  the  banner and heralds  and  trumpeters.  There  was Gandalf as  chief  herald,  and  Aragorn  with  the sons of Elrond,  and  Jomer  of Rohan,  and  Imrahil; and Legolas and Gimli and Peregrin were bidden to  go also, so that  all the enemies of Mordor should have a witness.       They came within cry of the Morannon, and unfurled the banner, and blew  upon their trumpets; and the heralds stood out and sent their voices up over   the battlement of Mordor.       'Come forth!'  they cried. 'Let the Lord of the Black   Land come forth!   Justice shall be done upon  him. For wrongfully he  has made war upon Gondor   and  wrested its lands. Therefore the King  of Gondor demands that he should  atone for his evils, and depart then for ever. Come forth!'       There was  a long  silence, and from wall and gate no cry or sound  was  heard in  answer. But Sauron had already laid his plans,  and he had a  mind   first to play these mice cruelly before he struck to kill.  So  it was that,  even  as  the  Captains were about to  turn  away, the  silence  was  broken  suddenly.  There came  a  long rolling  of great  drums like thunder in  the  mountains,  and  then  a  braying  of horns that  shook the very  stones and  stunned men's ears.  And thereupon the  middle  door  of the Black Gate  was  thrown open with a great clang, and out of it there came an embassy from the  Dark Tower.       At its  head there rode a  tall  and evil  shape, mounted  upon a black   horse, if  horse it was;  for it was huge  and hideous,  and its face was  a   frightful mask, more like a skull than a living head,  and in the sockets of  its eyes and in its nostrils there burned a flame. The  rider was robed  all  in  black, and black was his lofty helm;  yet this  was  no Ringwraith but a   living man. The Lieutenant of the Tower of Barad-dyr he was, and his name is   ####-remembered  in no  tale; for he himself had forgotten it, and he said: 'I am  the Mouth of Sauron.' But it is told that he was a renegade, who came of the  race of those  that are named the Black  NÂ®menureans;  for   they established  their dwellings in Middle-earth during the years of Sauron's domination, and  they worshipped him, being enamoured  of evil knowledge.  And he entered the  service of the  Dark Tower when it  first rose again,  and  because  of  his  cunning  he grew  ever  higher  in the Lord's favour;  and  he learned  great  sorcery, and knew much of the mind of Sauron; and he was more cruel than  any  orc."
