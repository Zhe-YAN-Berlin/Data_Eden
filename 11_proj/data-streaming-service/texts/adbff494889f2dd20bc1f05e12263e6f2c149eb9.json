There sat Thjoden and  Jomer, and before  them  on the ground sat a strange  squat shape of a  man,   gnarled as an old  stone, and the hairs of his scanty beard straggled on his  lumpy chin like  dry  moss.  He was  short-legged and fat-armed,  thick  and  stumpy, and  clad only  with grass about his waist. Merry  felt  that he  had  seen  him  before  somewhere, and suddenly  he remembered  the  P®kel-men  of  Dunharrow. Here  was one of those old  images  brought to life, or  maybe  a  creature descended  in true line through endless years from the models  used  by the forgotten craftsmen long ago.       There was  a silence as Merry crept nearer, and then the Wild Man began  to speak, in answer to some  question, it  seemed.  His  voice  was deep and  guttural,  yet to Merry's  surprise he spoke  the Common Speech, though in a  halting fashion, and uncouth words were mingled with it.       'No, father of  Horse-men,' he  said,  'we fight not. Hunt  only.  Kill  gorgyn  in woods, hate orc-folk. You hate gorgyn too. We help as we can. Wild  Men have long ears and long eyes; know all  paths. Wild Men live here before  Stone-houses; before Tall Men come up out of Water.'       'But our need is for aid in battle,' said Jomer. 'How will you and your  folk help us?'       'Bring news,' said  the Wild Man. 'We look out from hills. We climb big  mountain  and look down.  Stone-city is shut. Fire burns there  outside; now  inside too. You  wish to come there? Then you must be  quick. But gorgyn and  men out  of  far-away,'  he waved a  short gnarled  arm  eastward,  'sit  on  horse-road. Very many, mor e than Horse-men.'       'How do you know that?' said Jomer.       The old man's flat face and dark eyes showed nothing, but his voice was  sullen  with displeasure.  'Wild  men are wild, free, but not  children,' he  answered. 'I am great headman, Ghvn-buri-Ghvn. I count many things: stars in  sky, leaves  on trees, men in  the dark. You have a score of scores  counted  ten  times and five. They  have more.  Big fight, and who will win? And many  more walk round walls of Stone-houses.'       'Alas! he speaks all too shrewdly,' said  Thjoden. 'And our scouts  say  that they have  cast trenches  and  stakes across the road.  We cannot sweep  them away in sudden onset.'       'And yet we need great haste,' said Jomer. 'Mundburg is on fire!'       'Let Ghvn-buri-Ghvn finish!' said the Wild Man. 'More than one road  he    ####-knows. He will lead you by road where no pits are, no gorgyn walk, only Wild  Men  and  beasts. Many paths were  made  when Stonehouse-folk were  stronger.  They carved  hills as  hunters carve beast -flesh.  Wild  Men  think they ate  stone for food. They  went through Dr®adan  to Rimmon with great wains.  They  go  no longer. Road is forgotten, but not by Wild  Men. Over hill and behind  hill it  lies still  under grass and tree, there behind Rimmon  and down  to  Don, and back at the  end to  Horse -men's road. Wild Men will show  you that  road. Then you will kill gorgyn  and drive away bad dark  with  bright iron,  and Wild Men can go back to sleep in the wild woods.'       Jomer  and  the king  spoke  together  in their  own  tongue. At length  Thjoden turned to the Wild Man.   'We will receive your offer,' he said.  'For   though we leave a host of foes behind, what matter? If the Stone-city falls,  then we shall  have  no returning. If it  is saved, then the orc-host itself  will be cut off. If you are faithful, Ghvn-buri-Ghvn, then we will  give you   rich reward, and you shall have the friendship of the Mark for ever.'       'Dead  men are not friends to living men, and give them no gifts,' said  the Wild Man.  'But if you live after the Darkness, then leave Wild Men alone  in the woods and do  not hunt them like beasts any more. Ghvn-buri-Ghvn will  not lead  you into trap. He will go himself with father of Horse-men, and if  he leads you wrong, you will kill him.'       'So be it!' said Thjoden.       'How long will it take to pass by the enemy and come back to the road?'  asked Jomer. 'We must go at foot-pace, if you guide us; and  I doubt not the  way is narrow.'       'Wild Men go quick on feet,' said Ghvn. 'Way is wide for four horses in  Stonewain  Valley  yonder,'  he waved his hand southwards;  'but  narrow  at  beginning and at end.  Wild  Man could walk from here to Don between sunrise  and noon.'       'Then we must allow at least seven hours for the leaders,' said  Jomer;  'but  we must reckon rather on some ten hours for all. Things unforeseen may  hinder us, and if our host is all strung out, it will be long  ere it can be  set in order when we issue from the hills. What is the hour now?'       'Who knows?' said Thjoden. 'All is night now.'       'It is all dark, but  it is not all night.' said Ghvn.  'When Sun comes  we   feel   her,  even  when  she   is  hidden.   Already  she  climbs  over    ####-East -mountains."
