  "text": " The hobbits struggled  on,  until at last they  were  clinging with  desperate fingers to the steps  ahead, and forcing their  aching knees  to bend and  straighten; and ever as  the stair cut its way deeper  into the  sheer mountain the rocky walls  rose  higher and higher above their heads.        At  length, just as they felt that they could endure no more, they  saw  Gollum's  eyes peering  down at them again. `We're up,' he whispered. 'First   stair's past. Clever hobbits to  climb so high, very  clever hobbits. Just a   few more little steps and that's all, yes.'       Dizzy and very  tired Sam, and Frodo following him, crawled up the last   step, and sat down rubbing their legs  and knees. They were in  a  deep dark  passage that seemed still to go  up before  them,  though at a gentler slope  and without steps. Gollum did not let them rest long.       'There's another stair still,' he said. `Much  longer stair. Rest  when  we get to the top of next stair. Not yet.'       Sam groaned. 'Longer, did you say? ' he asked.       'Yes, yess, longer,' said Gollum. `But not  so  difficult. Hobbits have  climbed the Straight Stair. Next comes the Winding Stair.'       'And what after that? ' said Sam.       `We shall see,' said Gollum softly. `O yes, we shall see!  '       'I thought you said there  was  a  tunnel,' said  Sam.  `Isn't  there a   tunnel or something to go through? '       'O yes,  there's a tunnel,' said Gollum. `But hobbits  can rest  before  they try that. If they get through that,  they'll be nearly at the top. Very  nearly, if they get through. O yes! '       Frodo shivered. The climb had made him sweat, but now  he felt cold and  clammy, and there was a chill draught in the dark passage, blowing down from  the invisible  heights above. He got up and shook himself.  `Well, let's  go  on! ' he said. `This is no place to sit in.'       The passage seemed to go on  for miles, and always the chill air flowed  over them, rising as they went on to  a bitter wind. The mountains seemed to  be trying with their deadly breath to daunt them, to turn them back from the   secrets of the high places,  or to blow them away  into the darkness behind.  They only knew  that  they had come  to the end, when suddenly  they felt no   ####-wall at their right hand. They  could see very little. Great black shapeless  masses and deep  grey shadows loomed above  them and about them, but now  and  again a dull  red light flickered up under  the lowering  clouds, and for  a   moment  they were aware of  tall peaks, in  front  and on  either side, like  pillars holding up a vast sagging roof. They  seemed to have climbed up many  hundreds of feet, on to a wide shelf. A cliff was on their  left and a chasm  on their right.       Gollum led the way close under the cliff.  For the present they were no  longer climbing, but the  ground  was now more broken  and  dangerous in the  dark, and there  were blocks and  lumps of fallen stone  in the  way.  Their  going  was slow and  cautious.  How  many hours  had  passed  since they had  entered the  Morgul Vale  neither Sam nor Frodo could  any longer guess. The  night seemed endless.       At length they were once more aware of a wall looming up, and once more  a stairway opened before them. Again  they halted, and  again they  began to   climb. It was a long and weary ascent; but this  stairway did not delve into  the  mountain-side. Here  the huge cliff face sloped backwards, and the path  like  a  snake wound  to and fro across it. At one point it crawled sideways  right to the  edge of the dark chasm, and Frodo  glancing down saw below him  as  a vast deep pit the great ravine at the head of the Morgul Valley.  Down  in  its depths glimmered like  a glow-worm thread the  wraith-road from  the  dead city to the Nameless Pass. He turned hastily away.       Still  on and up the  stairway bent and  crawled, until  at last with a   final flight, short  and straight, it climbed out again on to another level.  The  path had veered away from the main pass in the great ravine, and it now  followed  its own  perilous course at the bottom of a lesser cleft among the  higher  regions  of  the Ephel DÂ®ath. Dimly  the hobbits could  discern tall  piers and jagged pinnacles of stone on either side, between which were great  crevices  and fissures blacker than  the night, where  forgotten winter s had  gnawed and carved the sunless stone. And now the red light in the sky seemed  stronger; though they could not tell whether a  dreadful morning were indeed  coming to this place of shadow, or whether  they saw only the flame of  some  great violence  of  Sauron in  the torment  of Gorgoroth  beyond.  Still far  ahead, and still high above, Frodo, looking up, saw, as he guessed, the very  crown of  this  bitter road. Against the sullen redness of the eastern sky a   cleft was outlined  in  the topmost ridge,  narrow, deep-cloven between  two   ####-black shoulders; and on either shoulder was a horn of stone."
