All things now went well, with  hope always of becoming  still  better;  and Sam  was  as busy and as  full of delight as even a hobbit  could  wish.  Nothing  for him marred that whole year, except  for some vague anxiety about  his  master. Frodo dropped quietly  out of all the doings of the  Shire, and   ####-Sam was  pained to notice how little  honour he  had in his own country. Few  people  knew  or  wanted  to  know about  his  deeds and  adventures;  their  admiration  and  respect were given mostly  to Mr. Meriadoc and Mr. Peregrin  and (if Sam had known it) to himself. Also in  the  autumn there appeared  a   shadow of old troubles.        One evening Sam came into the  study and  found his master looking very  strange. He was very pale and his eyes seemed to see things far away.       'What's the matter, Mr. Frodo?' said Sam.       'I am wounded,' he answered, 'wounded; it will never really heal.'       But then  he  got   up, and the  turn seemed to  pass, and he  was quite  himself the next day. It was not until afterwards that Sam recalled that the  date  was October the sixth. Two years before on that day it was dark in the  dell under Weathertop.       Time went on, and 1421 came  in. Frodo was ill again in March, but with  a great effort he concealed it, for Sam had other things to think about. The  first of  Sam and Rosie's children was born on the twenty-fifth of  March, a   date that Sam noted.       'Well,  Mr. Frodo,' he said. 'I'm in a bit of  a fix.  Rose  and me had  settled  to  call him Frodo, with  your leave; but it's  not  him , it's her.  Though as pretty a maidchild  as any one  could hope for, taking after  Rose  more than me, luckily. So we don't know what to do.'       'Well,  Sam,' said Frodo,  'what's wrong with the old customs? Choose a   flower name like Rose. Half the maidchildren in the Shire are called by such   names, and what could be better?'       'I  suppose  you're  right,  Mr.  Frodo,'  said  Sam.  'I've heard some  beautiful names on my travels,  but  I  suppose they're  a bit too grand for  daily wear and tear, as you  might say. The Gaffer, he says: \"Make it short,  and  then you won't have to cut it short before you can use it.\" But if it's  to be a  flower-name, then I don't  trouble about  the length: it  must be a   beautiful  flower, because, you see, I  think  she is very beautiful, and is  going to be beautifuller still.'       Frodo  thought  for  a  moment.  'Well,  Sam,  what  about  elanor, the  sun-star, you remember the little golden flower in the grass of Lothlurien?'       'You're  right  again, Mr. Frodo!' said  Sam delighted.  'That's what I  wanted.'       Little  Elanor  was nearly six months  old, and 1421  had passed to its  autumn, when Frodo called Sam into the study.   ####-     'It will be Bilbo's Birthday on Thursday, Sam,'  he  said. 'And he will  pass the Old Took. He will be a hundred and thirty-one!'       'So he will!' said Sam. 'He's a marvel!'       'Well,  Sam,' said Frodo. 'I want you to see Rose  and  find out if she  can spare  you, so that you and I can go off together.  You can't go  far or   for a long time now, of course,' he said a little wistfully.       'Well, not very well, Mr. Frodo.'       'Of course not.  But never mind.  You can see me on my way.  Tell  Rose  that you won't be away very long, not more than a fortnight; and you'll come   back quite safe.'       'I wish I could go all  the way  with  you to Rivendell, Mr. Frodo, and  see Mr. Bilbo,' said Sam. 'And yet the only place I really want to  be in is  here. I am that torn in two.'       'Poor Sam! It will feel like that, I am  afraid,'  said Frodo. 'But you   will be healed. You were meant to be solid and whole, and you will be.'       In the next day or  two Frodo went through his papers and  his writings  with Sam, and he handed over his keys.  There was  a big book with plain red  leather  covers; its  tall  pages were  now almost filled.  At the beginning  there were many leaves covered with Bilbo's thin wandering hand; but most of  it was written in Frodo's firm flowing script.  It was divided into chapters  but  Chapter 80 was unfinished, and after that  were some  blank leaves. The  title page had many titles on it, crossed out one after another, so:         My  Diary. My Unexpected  Journey.  There  and  Back  Again.  And  What  Happened After.       Adventures of  Five  Hobbits. The Tale  of the Great  Ring, compiled by  Bilbo  Baggins from his own  observations  and the  accounts of his friends.  What we did in the War of the Ring.       Here Bilbo's hand ended and Frodo had written:         THE DOWNFALL       OF THE       LORD OF THE RINGS       AND THE       RETURN OF THE KING         (as seen by the Little People; being the memoirs  of Bilbo and Frodo of   ####-the Shire, supplemented by the accounts of their friends and the learning of  the Wise."
