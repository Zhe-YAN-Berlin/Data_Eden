I'm starving.\" The Sorting of the new students into Houses took place at the start of every school year, but by an unlucky combination of circumstances, Harry hadn't been present at one since his own.  He was quite looking forward to it.  Just then, a highly excited, breathless voice called down the table. \"Hiya, Harry!\" It was Colin Creevey, a third year to whom Harry was something of a hero. \"Hi, Colin,\" said Harry warily. \"Harry, guess what?  Guess what, Harry?  My brother's starting!  My brother Dennis!\" \"Er - good,\" said Harry. \"He's really excited!\"  said Colin, practically bouncing up and down in his seat.  \"I just hope he's in Gryffindor!  Keep your fingers crossed, eh, Harry?\" \"Er - yeah, all right,\" said Harry.  He turned back to Hermione, Ron, and Nearly Headless Nick.  \"Brothers and sisters usually go in the same Houses, don't they?\"  he said.  He was judging by the Weasleys, all seven of whom had been put into Gryffindor. \"Oh no, not necessarily,\" said Hermione.  \"Parvati Patil's twin's in Ravenclaw, and they're identical. You'd think they'd be together, wouldn't you?\" Harry looked up at the staff table.  There seemed to be rather more empty seats there than usual.  Hagrid, of course, was still fighting his way across the lake with the first years; Professor McGonagall was presumably supervising the drying of the entrance hall floor, but there was another empty chair too, and Harry couldn't think who else was missing. \"Where's the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher?\"  said Hermione, who was also looking up at the teachers. They had never yet had a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher who had lasted more than three terms.  Harry's favorite by far had been Professor Lupin, who had resigned last year. He looked up and down the staff table.  There was definitely no new face there. \"Maybe they couldn't get anyone!\"  said Hermione, looking anxious. Harry scanned the table more carefully.  Tiny little Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was sitting on a large pile of cushions beside Professor Sprout, the Herbology teacher, whose hat was askew over her flyaway gray hair.  She was talking to Professor Sinistra of the Astronomy department.  On Professor Sinistra's other side was the sallow-faced, hook-nosed, greasy-haired Potions master, Snape - Harry's least favorite person at Hogwarts.  Harry's loathing of Snape was matched only by Snape's hatred of him, a hatred which had, if possible, intensified last year, when Harry had helped Sirius escape right under Snape's overlarge nose - Snape and Sirius had been enemies since their own school days. On Snape's other side was an empty seat, which Harry guessed was Professor McGonagall's.  Next to it, and in the very center of the table, sat Professor Dumbledore, the headmaster, his sweeping silver hair and beard shining in the candlelight, his magnificent deep green robes embroidered with many stars and moons.  The tips of Dumbledore's long, thin fingers were together and he was resting his chin upon them, staring up at the ceiling through his half-moon spectacles as though lost in thought.  Harry glanced up at the ceiling too.  It was enchanted to look like the sky outside, and he had never seen it look this stormy.  Black and purple clouds were swirling across it, and as another thunderclap sounded outside, a fork of lightning flashed across it. \"Oh hurry up,\" Ron moaned, beside Harry, \"I could eat a hippogriff.\"  The words were no sooner out of his mouth than the doors of the Great Hall opened and silence fell.  Professor McGonagall was leading a long line of first years up to the top of the Hall.  If Harry, Ron, and Hermione were wet, it was nothing to how these first years looked. They appeared to have swum across the lake rather than sailed.  All of them were shivering with a combination of cold and nerves as they filed along the staff table and came to a halt in a line facing the rest of the school - all of them except the smallest of the lot, a boy with mousy hair, who was wrapped in what Harry recognized as Hagrid's moleskin overcoat.  The coat was so big for him that it hooked as though he were draped in a furry black circus tent.  His small face protruded from over the collar, looking almost painfully excited.  When he had lined up with his terrified-looking peers, he caught Colin Creevey's eye, gave a double thumbs-up, and mouthed, I fell in the lake!  He looked positively delighted about it. Professor McGonagall now placed a three-legged stool on the ground before the first years and, on top of it, an extremely old, dirty patched wizard's hat.  The first years stared at it. So did everyone else.  For a moment, there was silence.  Then a long tear near the brim opened wide like a mouth, and the hat broke into song:  A thousand years or more ago,   When I was newly sewn, There lived four wizards of renown, Whose names are still well known: Bold Gryffindor, from wild moor, Fair Ravenclaw, from glen,   Sweet Hufflepuff, from valley broad,   Shrewd Slytherin, from fin."
