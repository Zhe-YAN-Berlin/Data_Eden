Pippin and  Sam  had remained  flat  in the  grass, and had seen nothing; so Frodo  described the rider and  his strange behaviour.       'I can't say why, but I felt certain he was looking or smelling for me;  and also I felt certain that I did  not want him to discover  me. I've never  seen or fell anything like it in the Shire before.'       'But what has  one of the Big  People got  to do with us?' said Pippin.  'And what is he doing in this part of the world?'       'There are some Men about,' said Frodo. 'Down in the Southfarthing they   have  had trouble  with Big  People,  I believe. But I have  never heard  of  anything like this rider. I wonder  where he comes from.'       'Begging  your  pardon,' put  in Sam  suddenly,  'I know where he comes  from. It's from Hobbiton that  this here black  rider comes, unless  there's  more than one. And I know where he's going to.'       'What do you mean?' said Frodo sharply, looking at him in astonishment.   'Why didn't you speak up before?'       'I have only just remembered, sir. It was like this: when I got back to  our  hole yesterday evening with the key, my dad, he says to me: Hello, Sam!  he says. I thought you were away with Mr. Frodo this morning. There's been a   strange customer asking for Mr. Baggins of Bag End, and he's only just gone.  I've sent him on to Bucklebury. Not that I liked the sound of him. He seemed  mighty put out, when I told him Mr. Baggins had  left his old home for good.   ####-Hissed at me, he did.  It gave me quite a shudder. What sort of a fellow was   he? says I to the Gaffer. / don't know,  says he; but he wasn't a hobbit. He  was tall and black-like, and he  stooped aver me. I reckon it was one of the  Big Folk from foreign parts. He spoke funny.       'I  couldn't stay  to  hear more, sir, since  you were  waiting; and  I  didn't give much heed to it myself. The Gaffer is getting old, and more than  a bit blind,  and it  must have been  near dark when this fellow come up the  Hill  and  found him taking the air at the end of our Row. I hope  he hasn't  done no harm, sir, nor me.'       'The Gaffer can't be blamed anyway,' said Frodo. 'As a matter of fact I  heard him talking to a  stranger, who  seemed to  be inquiring for me, and I  nearly went and asked him who it was. I wish I had, or you had told me about  it before. I might have been more careful on the road.'       'Still, there may be no connexion between  this rider and the  Gaffer's  stranger,' said Pippin. 'We left Hobbiton  secretly enough, and  I don't see  how he could have followed us.'       'What about the smelling, sir?' said Sam. 'And the Gaffer said he was a   black chap.'       'I wish  I had  waited  for  Gandalf,' Frodo  muttered. 'But perhaps it  would only have made matters worse.'       'Then you know  or guess something about this  rider?' said Pippin, who  had caught the muttered words.        'I don't know, and I would rather  not guess,'  said Frodo. 'All right,  cousin Frodo! You can  keep your  secret for the present,  if you want to be  mysterious. In the meanwhile what are we to do? I should like a  bite and  a   sup,  but somehow  I think  we had better move on from here.  Your  talk  of  sniffing riders with invisible noses has unsettled me.'       'Yes, I think we  will move on now,' said Frodo;  'but  not on the road  -in case  that rider comes back, or another  follows him. We  ought to do  a   good step more today. Buckland is still miles away.'       The shadows  of  the trees  were long and  thin  on the  grass, as they  started off again. They now kept  a stone's throw to  the left of  the road,  and kept out of sight of it as much  as they  could. But this hindered them;  for the grass was thick and  tussocky, and the ground uneven, and the  trees  began to draw together into thickets.        The sun had gone down  red behind the hills at their backs, and evening  was coming on before they came back to the road at the end of the long level   ####-over which  it had run straight for  some miles.  At that point it bent left  and  went down into the lowlands of  the Yale  making for Stock;  but a lane  branched right, winding  through a  wood of ancient oak-trees on its way  to  Woodhall. 'That is the way for us,' said Frodo.       Not far from the road-meeting they came on the huge hulk  of a tree: it  was  still alive  and had leaves  on  the small branches that it had put out  round the  broken  stumps of its long-fallen limbs; but it  was hollow,  and  could  be entered  by  a great  crack  on the  side  away from the road. The  hobbits crept inside, and sat there upon a floor  of old leaves and  decayed  wood.  They rested and had a light  meal, talking quietly and listening from  time to time.       Twilight  was about  them as they crept back to the lane. The West wind  was sighing in the branches. Leaves were whispering."
