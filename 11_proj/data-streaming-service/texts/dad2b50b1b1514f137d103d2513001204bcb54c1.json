It is forgiven. Great  heart will not  be denied. Live now  in blessedness; and when  you  sit  in peace with  your   pipe, think  of  me! For  never now shall I  sit with you in Meduseld,  as I  promised, or listen to your herb-lore.' He closed his eyes, and Merry  bowed   beside him. Presently  he spoke again. 'Where is  Jomer? For my eyes darken,  and I would see him ere I go.  He must be  king after  me. And  I would send   word to Jowyn. She, she would not have me leave her, and now I shall not see  her again, dearer than daughter.'       'Lord,  lord,' began Merry brokenly, 'she  is--';  but  at that  moment  there  was  a  great clamour, and all  about  them horns and  trumpets  were  blowing. Merry looked round:  he had forgotten  the war, and  all  the world  beside, and many hours it  seemed since the king rode to his fall, though in  truth it was only a little while. But now he saw that they were in danger of  being caught  in  the  very midst  of the great  battle that would  soon  be  joined.       New forces of the enemy were hastening up the road from the River;  and   from  u nder the walls came  the  legions of Morgul; and  from  the southward  fields came footmen of Harad with horsemen before them, and behind them  rose  the huge backs of the mymakil with war-towers  upon them. But  northward the  white crest of Jomer led the great front of  the Rohirrim which he had again  gathered and marshalled;  and out of the City  came all the  strength of men  that  was in  it, and  the silver swan of Dol Amroth was borne  in  the van,  driving the enemy from the Gate.       For  a  moment  the thought flitted through  Merry's  mind:  'Where  is  Gandalf? Is he not here? Could he not  have saved the  king and Jowyn?'  But  thereupon Jomer rode  up  in haste, and with him  came the  knights  of  the   ####-household that still lived and had now mastered their horses. They looked in  wonder  at  the carcase of the fell  beast that lay there:  and their steeds  would  not go near. But Jomer leaped from the  saddle, and  grief and dismay  fell upon him as he came to the king's side and stood there in silence.       Then one of the knights took the king's banner from the hand of Guthlbf  the banner -bearer who  lay  dead, and he lifted it up. Slowly Thjoden opened  his eyes. Seeing the banner he made a sign that it should be given to Jomer.       'Hail, King of  the Mark!' he said.  'Ride now  to  victory!  Bid Jowyn  farewell!' And so he died,  and knew  not that Jowyn lay near him. And those  who stood by wept, crying: 'Thjoden King! Thjoden King!'       But Jomer said to them:       Mourn not overmuch! Mighty was the fallen,       meet was his ending. When his mound is raised,       women then shall weep. War now calls us!       Yet  he himself wept  as he spoke.  'Let  his knights remain  here,' he  said; 'and bear his body in honour from the field, lest the battle ride over   it! Yea, and all these other of the king's men that lie here.' And he looked  at  the  slain,  recalling their  names. Then suddenly he beheld  his sister   Jowyn as she lay, and he knew her. He stood a moment as a man who is  pierced  in the midst of a cry by  an arrow through the heart;  and then his face went  deathly white;  and a cold  fury rose in him, so that  all speech failed him  for a while. A fey mood took him.       'Jowyn,  Jowyn!'  he  cried at last:  'Jowyn,  how come you  here? What  madness or devilry is this? Death, death, death! Death take us all!'       Then without taking  counsel or waiting for the approach of  the men of  the City, he spurred headlong back  to the front of the great host, and blew  a horn, and cried  aloud for  the onset. Over the field rang his clear voice  calling: 'Death! Ride, ride to ruin and the world's ending!'       And with that the host  began to move. But the Rohirrim sang  no  more.  Death  they cried with one voice loud and terrible, and gathering speed  like  a  great tide their battle swept about their fallen king and passed, roaring  away southwards.        And still  Meriadoc  the hobbit stood there blinking through  his tears  and no one spoke to him, indeed none seemed to heed him. He brushed away  the  tears, and stooped to pick up the green shield that Jowyn had given him; and   ####-he slung it at his back.  Then he looked for his sword that he had let fall;  for even as he struck his blow his arm was numbed, and now he could only use  his left hand. And behold! there  lay his weapon, but the blade  was smoking   like a dry branch that has been thrust in  a fire; and as  he watched it, it  writhed and withered and was consumed.       So passed the sword  of the Barrow-downs, work of Westernesse. But glad  would  he have been  to know its fate who wrought  it slowly long ago in the   North-kingdom when the DÂ®nedain were young,  and chief among  their foes  was  the dread realm of Angmar and its sorcerer king."
