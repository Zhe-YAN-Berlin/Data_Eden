And my search would  have been in vain,  but for the  help that I  had from a friend: Aragorn, the greatest traveller and huntsman of this  age  of  the world.  Together we  sought  for  Gollum down  the  whole length  of  Wilderland, without hope, and without success. But at last, when I had given  up the chase and turned to other parts, Gollum was found. My friend returned   ####-out of the great perils bringing the miserable creature with him.       'What he had  been doing  he would not say. He only wept and  called us  cruel,  with many a gollum in his throat; and when we pressed him he  whined  and  cringed, and  rubbed his  long hands, licking his  fingers  as if  they  pained  him, as if he remembered some old torture.  But I am afraid there is  no possible doubt: he had made his slow, sneaking way, step by step, mile by  mile, south, down at last to the Land of Mordor.'       A heavy silence fell in the room.  Frodo could hear his  heart beating.  Even outside everything seemed still. No sound of Sam's  shears could now be  heard.       'Yes,  to Mordor,' said Gandalf. 'Alas! Mordor draws all wicked things,   and the Dark Power was bending all its will to  gather them there.  The Ring  of the Enemy would leave  its  mark, too, leave him open to the summons. And  all folk were whispering then of the new Shadow in the South, and its hatred   of  the  West.  There were his fine  new  friends, who would help him in his  revenge!        'Wretched  fool!  In that land he  would  learn  much, too much for his  comfort. And sooner or later as he lurked and pried on  the borders he would   be caught, and taken - for examination. That was the way of it, I fear. When  he was found he  had already been  there long,  and was on his  way back. On  some errand  of  mischief. But  that  does  not matter  much now. His  worst   mischief was done.       'Yes, alas! through  him the  Enemy has learned that the One  has  been  found again. He  knows where Isildur fell. He knows  where  Gollum found his  ring. He knows that it is a Great Ring, for it gave long life. He knows that  it is not one of the  Three, for they have  never been lost, and they endure  no evil. He knows that it is not one of the Seven, or the Nine, for they are  accounted for.  He  knows that it is  the One.  And he has  at last heard, I  think, of hobbits and the Shire.       'The Shire - he may be seeking for  it now, if he has not already found  out where it lies. Indeed, Frodo, I fear that  he may  even think  that  the  long-unnoticed name of Baggins has become important.'       'But this is  terrible!' cried Frodo. 'Far  worse than the worst that I  imagined from your hints and warnings. O Gandalf, best of friends, what am I  to do? For now I am really afraid. What  am  I to do? What a pity that Bilbo   did not stab that vile creature, when he had a chance!'       'Pity? It was Pity that stayed his hand. Pity, and Mercy: not to strike   ####-without need. And  he has been well rewarded, Frodo. Be sure that he took so  little hurt from the evil,  and escaped  in  the  end, because he began  his  ownership of the Ring so. With Pity.'       'I am sorry,' said  Frodo.  'But I am frightened; and I do not feel any  pity for Gollum.'       'You have not seen him,' Gandalf broke in.       'No,  and I don't  want to,' said Frodo. I can't understand you. Do you   mean to  say that you, and the Elves, have let him live on  after all  those  horrible  deeds? Now at any rate he is  as bad as an Orc, and just an enemy.  He deserves death.'       'Deserves it! I daresay he does. Many that live deserve death. And some  that die deserve life. Can you give it to them? Then do not be too eager  to  deal out death in judgement.  For  even the very wise cannot see all ends. I  have not much hope  that Gollum can be cured before  he dies, but there is a   chance of it. And  he is bound  up with the fate of the Ring. My heart tells  me that  he  has some part to play yet, for good or ill, before the end; and  when that comes, the pity  of Bilbo may  rule the fate  of many -  yours not  least. In any case we did  not kill him:  he is very old  and very wretched.  The Wood-elves have him in prison, but they treat him with such  kindness as  they can find in their wise hearts.'       'All the same,' said Frodo,  'even if  Bilbo could  not kill  Gollum, I  wish he had not kept the  Ring. I wish he had never found it, and that I had  not got it!  Why  did  you  let me keep it? Why didn't you make me  throw it   away, or, or destroy it?'       'Let you? Make you?' sa id the  wizard.  'Haven't you been  listening to  all  that I  have said? You are not thinking of what you are saying.  But as  for throwing  it away,  that was  obviously wrong. These Rings have a way of  being  found. In evil hands it might have done great evil."
