  "text": "       Pippin could see all the  Pelennor laid out before him, dotted into the  distance with farmsteads  and little  walls, barns  and  byres, but  nowhere  could he see any kine  or other  beasts.  Many  roads and tracks crossed the  green fields,  and there  was much coming and going: wains moving  in  lines  towards the Great Gate, and  others passing  out.  Now and again  a horseman  would ride up, and leap from  the saddle  and hasten into the City. But most   of the traffic went out along the chief highway,  and that turned south, and  then  bending  swifter than the River skirted the hills and passed soon from  sight.  It was wide  and well-paved, and along its eastern  edge ran a broad  green riding-track, and beyond that a wall . On the ride horsemen galloped to   and  fro, but all the  street seemed to be  choked with great  covered wains  going  south.  But  soon Pippin  saw that  all was in fact well-ordered: the  wains were  moving in  three  lines,  one swifter  drawn  by horses; another   slower, great waggons with fair housings of many colours, drawn by oxen; and  along the west rim of the road many smaller carts hauled by trudging men.       'That is the  road  to the  vales of  Tumladen and  Lossarnach, and the  mountain-villages,  and then on  to Lebennin,' said  Beregond. 'There  go the  last  of  the  wains that bear away to refuge the aged the children, and the  women that must go  with them.  They must all  be gone from the Gate and the   ####-road  clear for a league  before  noon: tha t was the  order.  It  is  a  sad  necessity.'  He sighed. 'Few, maybe, of those now sundered will meet  again.   And there  were  always too few children  in  this  city; but now there  are  none-save some young lads  that will not depart,  and may  find some task to  do: my own son is one of them.'       They fell silent for a while. Pippin gazed anxiously eastward, as if at  any moment he might see thousands of orcs pouring over the fields. 'What can  I see there?' he asked, pointing down to the  middle of the great  curve  of  the Anduin. 'Is that another city, or what is it?'       'It was  a city,'  said Beregond, 'the chief city of Gondor,  of  which  this  was only a fortress. For that is the ruin of Osgiliath  on either side  of Anduin, which our enemies took and burned long ago. Yet we won it back in  the  days of  the youth  of Denethor: not to dwell in,  but  to  hold as  an  outpost, and  to rebuild  the  bridge for the  passage of our arms. And then  came the Fell Riders out of Minas Morgul.'       'The Black R iders?' said Pippin, opening his eyes,  and they  were wide  and dark with an old fear re-awakened.       'Yes,  they  were  black,' said  Beregond,  'and  I  see  that you know  something of them, though you have not spoken of them in any of your tales.'       'I know of them,' said  Pippin softly,  'but I will not  speak of  them  now, so near, so near.' He  broke  off  and lifted his eyes above the River,  and  it  seemed to  him that  all  he could  see was  a vast and threatening  shadow. Perhaps it was mountains looming on the verge of sight, their jagged  edges softened by wellnigh twenty leagues of misty air; perhaps it was but a   cloud-wall, and beyond that again a yet deeper gloom. But  even as he looked  it seemed to his eyes that the gloom was growing and gathering, very slowly,  slowly rising to smother the regions of the sun.       'So  near to Mordor?' said  Beregond quietly.  'Yes,  there it lies. We  seldom name it; but we have dwelt ever in sight of that shadow: sometimes it  seems fainter and more distant;  sometimes nearer and darker. It  is growing  and  darkening now; and  therefore  our fear  and disquiet grow too. And the  Fell Riders, less  than a year ago they won back the crossings, and  many of  our best men were  slain.  Boromir it  was that drove  the enemy at last back   from this western shore, and we hold still the near half of Osgiliath. For a   little  while. But  we  await  now  a new onslaught there.  Maybe the  chief  onslaught of the war that comes.'       'When?' said Pippin. 'Have  you a  guess?  For I saw the  beacons  last   ####-night and  the errand-riders; and  Gandalf said that it was a sign that  war  had begun. He seemed in a desperate hurry. But now everything seems to  have  slowed up again.'       'Only because  everything is now ready,' said Beregond. 'It  is but the  deep breath before the plunge.'       'But why were the beacons lit last night?'       'It is  over-late  to  send  for aid  when you  are  already besieged,'  answered Beregond. 'But I  do  not  know the  counsel of  the  Lord  and his  captains. They have many ways of gathering news.  And  the Lord Denethor  is  unlike  other men: he sees far. Some  say that as he sits alone in his  high  chamber  in the Tower at night, and bends his thought  this way and that, he   can read somewhat of the future; and that he  will  at times search even the  mind of the  Enemy, wrestling  with  him."
