He slackened his speed  a little, seeking new foes,  and  his  knights  came  about him, and Dernhelm was with  them. Ahead nearer the walls Elfhelm's  men  were among the  siege-engines, hewing, slaying, driving their foes into  the  fire-pits. Well nigh all the northern half of the Pelennor was overrun,  and  there camps were  blazing, orcs were  flying towards  the  River like  herds  before the hunters; and the Rohirrim went hither  and thither at their will.  But they had not yet overthrown the siege, nor won the Gate. Many foes stood  before  it, and on the  further  half of the  plain were  other hosts  still  unfought. Southward beyond the road lay  the main force of the Haradrim, and  there  their  horsemen were gathered about the standard of  their chieftain.  And he looked  out, and in the growing light he saw the banner of  the king,   and that  it was far  ahead of the battle with few men about it. Then he was  filled with a  red wrath  and shouted aloud, and  displaying  his  standard,  black serpent upon  scarlet, he  came against the white  horse and the green  with great press of men; and  the  drawing of the scimitars of the Southrons  was like a glitter of stars.        Then Thjoden was  aware of  him, and  would not wait for his onset, but  crying to Snowmane he  charged headlong to greet him. Great was the clash of  their  meeting. But the white fury  of the Northmen burned the  hotter,  and  more skilled  was  their knighthood with long spears  and bitter. Fewer were  they  but they  clove through the Southrons  like a fire-bolt  in  a forest.  Right  through the press  drove  Thjoden Thengel's son,  and  his  spear was   ####-shivered as he threw down  their chieftain.  Out  swept  his sword,  and  he  spurred  to  the  standard,  hewed staff  and bearer;  and the black serpent  foundered. Then all that was left unslain of  their cavalry  turned and fled  far away.       But  lo! suddenly in  the  midst of the glory  of the  king his  golden  shield was dimmed. The new morning was blotted from the sky. Dark fell  about  him. Horses reared and screamed. Men cast  from the saddle lay grovelling on  the ground.       'To  me!  To me!' cried Thjoden. 'Up Eorlingas!  Fear no darkness!' But  Snowmane wild with terror stood up  on high, fighting with the air, and then  with a great scream he crashed upon his side: a black dart had pierced  him.  The king fell beneath him.       The great shadow  descended like a falling cloud. And behold!  it was a   winged  creature: if bird, then  greater than all  other  birds, and it  was  naked, and neither quill nor  feather did it bear, and its vast pinions were  as webs of hide between horned fingers; and it stank. A creature of an older   world maybe it  was,  whose  kind,  fingering  in  forgotten mountains  cold  beneath the Moon,  outstayed their day,  and in hideous eyrie bred this last  untimely brood, apt to evil. And the Dark  Lord took it, and nursed it  with  fell meats, until  it grew beyond the measure of all  other things that fly;  and he gave it to his servant to be his steed. Down, down it came, and then,  folding its fingered webs, it gave a croaking cry, and settled upon the body  of Snowmane, digging in its claws, stooping its long naked neck.       Upon it  sat a shape, black -mantled , huge and threatening. A  crown  of  steel he bore, but between rim and robe naught was there to see, save only a   deadly  gleam of eyes: the Lord  of the  Nazgyl. To the air he had returned,  summoning  his  steed ere the darkness failed,  and now he was  come  again,  bringing ruin,  turning hope to despair, and victory to death. A great black   mace he wielded.       But Thjoden  was  not utterly forsaken. The  knights of  his house  lay  slain about him, or else mastered by the madness of  their steeds were borne  far away. Yet one stood  there still:  Dernhelm  the  young, faithful beyond  fear; and he wept, for he had  loved his lord as a father. Right through the  charge Merry had  been borne unharmed behind him, until the Shadow came;  and  then  Windfola  had thrown  them in his terror, and now  ran  wild upon  the   ####-plain. Merry crawled on all fours like a dazed beast, and  such a horror was  on him that he was blind and sick.       'King's man! King's man!' his heart cried within him. 'You must stay by  him. As a father you shall be to me, you said.' But his will made no answer,  and his body shook. He dared not open his eyes or look up.       Then out of the blackness in his mind he thought that he heard Dernhelm  speaking; yet now the voice seemed strange, recalling  some other voice  that  he had known.       'Begone, foul dwimmerlaik, lord of carrion! Leave the dead in peace!'       A cold voice answered: 'Come not between the Nazgyl and his prey! Or he  will not slay thee  in thy turn."
