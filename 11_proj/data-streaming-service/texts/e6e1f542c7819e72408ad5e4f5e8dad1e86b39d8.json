It was sort of true; he was nervous, but he kept running over all the hexes and spells he had been practicing in his mind as they walked, and the knowledge that he could remember them all made him feel better. They walked onto the Quidditch field, which was now completely unrecognizable.  A twenty-foot-high hedge ran all the way around the edge of it.  There was a gap right in front of them:  the entrance to the vast maze.  The passage beyond it looked dark and creepy. Five minutes later, the stands had begun to fill; the air was full of excited voices and the rumbling of feet as the hundreds of students filed into their seats.  The sky was a deep, clear blue now, and the first stars were starting to appear. Hagrid, Professor Moody, Professor McGonagall, and Professor Flitwick came walking into the stadium and approached Bagman and the champions.  They were wearing large, red, luminous stars on their hats, all except Hagrid, who had his on the back of his moleskin vest. \"We are going to be patrolling the outside of the maze,\" said Professor McGonagall to the champions.  \"If you get into difficulty, and wish to be rescued, send red sparks into the air, and one of us will come and get you, do you understand?\" The champions nodded. \"Off you go, then!\"  said Bagman brightly to the four patrollers. \"Good luck. Harry,\" Hagrid whispered, and the four of them walked away in different directions, to station themselves around the maze.  Bagman now pointed his wand at his throat, muttered, \"Sonorus,\" and his magically magnified voice echoed into the stands. \"Ladies and gentlemen, the third and final task of the Triwizard Tournament is about to begin!  Let me remind you how the points currently stand!  Tied in first place, with eighty-five points each - Mr. Cedric Diggory and Mr. Harry Potter, both of Hogwarts School!\"  The cheers and applause sent birds from the Forbidden Forest fluttering into the darkening sky.  \"In second place, with eighty points - Mr. Viktor Krum, of Durmstrang Institute!\"  More applause. \"And in third place - Miss Fleur Delacour, of Beauxbatons Academy!\" Harry could just make out Mrs. Weasley, Bill, Ron, and Hermione applauding Fleur politely, halfway up the stands.  He waved up at them, and they waved back, beaming at him. \"So ... on my whistle, Harry and Cedric!\" said Bagman. \"Three - two - one -\" He gave a short blast on his whistle, and Harry and Cedric hurried forward into the maze. The towering hedges cast black shadows across the path, and, whether because they were so tall and thick or because they had been enchanted, the sound of the surrounding crowd was silenced the moment they entered the maze.  Harry felt almost as though he were underwater again.  He pulled out his wand, muttered, \"Lumos,\" and heard Cedric do the same just behind him. After about fifty yards, they reached a fork.  They looked at each other. \"See you,\" Harry said, and he took the left one, while Cedric took the right. Harry heard Bagman's whistle for the second time.  Krum had entered the maze.  Harry sped up.  His chosen path seemed completely deserted.  He turned right, and hurried on, holding his wand high over his head, trying to see as far ahead as possible.  Still, there was nothing in sight. Bagman's whistle blew in the distance for the third time.  All of the champions were now inside. Harry kept looking behind him.  The old feeling that he was being watched was upon him.  The maze was growing darker with every passing minute as the sky overhead deepened to navy.  He reached a second fork. \"Point Me,\" he whispered to his wand, holding it flat in his palm. The wand spun around once and pointed toward his right, into solid hedge.  That way was north, and he knew that he needed to go northwest for the center of the maze.  The best he could do was to take the left fork and go right again as soon as possible. The path ahead was empty too, and when Harry reached a right turn and took it, he again found his way unblocked.  Harry didn't know why, but the lack of obstacles was unnerving him.  Surely he should have met something by now?  It felt as though the maze were luring him into a false sense of security.  Then he heard movement right behind him.  He held out his wand, ready to attack, but its beam fell only upon Cedric, who had just hurried out of a path on the right-hand side.  Cedric looked severely shaken.  The sleeve of his robe was smoking. \"Hagrid's Blast-Ended Skrewts!\" he hissed.  \"They're enormous - I only just got away!\" He shook his head and dived out of sight, along another path.  Keen to put plenty of distance between himself and the skrewts, Harry hurried off again.  Then, as he turned a corner, he saw ... a dementor gliding toward him.  Twelve feet tall, its face hidden by its hood, its rotting, scabbed hands outstretched, it advanced, sensing its way blindly toward him."
