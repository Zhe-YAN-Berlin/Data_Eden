Shall Men behold the Silver Tree,       Or West Wind blow again between the Mountains and the Sea?        Now  let  us go!' he said , drawing his  eyes away from  the South,  and  looking out west and north to the way that he must tread.       The ridge upon  which the companions  stood  went down  steeply  before  their feet. Below it twenty  fathoms or  more, there was  a wide and  rugged  shelf which ended suddenly in the brink  of a sheer  cliff: the East Wall of  Rohan.  So  ended  the  Emyn Muil, and  the  green plains  of  the  Rohirrim  stretched away before them to the edge of sight.       'Look!' cried Legolas, pointing up into the pale sky above them. 'There  is the eagle  again! He is very high. He seems  to be flying now away,  from  this land back to the North. He is going with great speed. Look!'       'No, not even my eyes can  see him, my good Legolas,' said Aragorn. 'He  must  be far aloft indeed. I wonder  what  is his errand, if he is the  same  bird that I have seen before. But look! I  can  see something nearer at hand  and more urgent; there is something moving over the plain!'       'Many  things,'  said  Legolas. 'It is a great company on foot;  but  I  cannot  say  more,  nor see what kind of folk they  may  be. They  are  many  leagues  away: twelve,  I  guess; but  the flatness of the plain is hard  to  measure.'       'I think,  nonetheless, that we no longer  need any  trail  to  tell us  which  way  to go,' said Gimli. 'Let  us find a path down to  the  fields as  quick as may be.'       'I  doubt  if you will  find a path quicker  than the one that the Orcs  chose,' said Aragorn.       They  followed their enemies now  by the clear light  of day. It seemed  that the Orcs had  pressed on with all possible speed. Every  now  and again  the pursuers found things that had been dropped or cast away: food-bags, the  rinds and crusts of hard grey bread. a torn black cloak, a heavy iron-nailed  shoe  broken on the stones. The trail  led them  north along the top  of the   ####-escarpment, and at length they  came to a deep cleft carved in the rock by a   stream  that  splashed  noisily down.  In the  narrow  ravine  a rough  path  descended like a steep stair into the plain.       At  the bottom  they came with  a strange  suddenness  on the grass  of  Rohan. It swelled like a green sea up to the very foot of the Emyn Muil. The  falling stream vanished into a deep growth of cresses and water -plants,  and   they could  hear it tinkling away in green tunnels, down long gentle  slopes  towards the fens of Entwash Vale far  away.  They seemed to have left winter   clinging  to  the  hills  behind. Here  the air was softer  and warmer,  and  faintly  scented,  as if spring was already stirring and the sap was flowing  again in  herb and leaf. Legolas took a deep breath,  like one that drinks a   great draught after long thirst in barren places.       'Ah!  the green smell!'  he said. 'It is better than much sleep. Let us  run! '       'Light feet may run swiftly here,' said Aragorn.  'More swiftly, maybe,  than iron-shod Orcs. Now we have a chance to lessen their lead!'       They went in single file, running like hounds on a strong scent, and an  eager  light was  in their eyes.  Nearly due  west the  broad  swath  of the  marching Orcs  tramped  its  ugly slot;  the sweet  grass of  Rohan had been  bruised and  blackened as  they  passed. Presently  Aragorn  gave a cry  and   turned aside. 'Stay!' he shouted. 'Do not follow me yet!'  He ran quickly to  the right, away  from the  main trail; for he had seen  footprints that went  that way, branching off  from the  others,  the  marks of small unshod feet.  These, however, did  not go far before they were crossed by orc-prints, also  coming out  from the main  trail behind and in  front, and then  they curved  sharply back  again  and were lost  in the  trampling. At the furthest point  Aragorn stooped and picked up something from the grass; then he ran back.       'Yes,' he said, 'they are quite plain:  a hobbit's footprints. Pippin's  I think. He is smaller than the other. And look at this! He held up a  thing  that glittered in  the sunlight. It  looked  like  the new-opened leaf of  a   beech-tree, fair and strange in that treeless plain.       'The brooch of an elven-cloak!' cried Legolas and Gimli together.       'Not idly do the leaves of Lurien  fall,' said  Aragorn.  'This did not  drop by chance: it  was  cast away as  a token to  any that  might follow. I  think Pippin ran away from the trail for that purpose.'       'Then he at least was alive,'  said  Gimli. 'And he  had the use of his  wits, and of his legs too. That is heartening. We do not pursue in vain.'   ####-     'Let us hope that  he  did not pay  too dearly for his  boldness,' said  Legolas.  'C ome! Let us  go on! The thought of those merry young folk  driven  like cattle burns my heart."
