It was  rough and  broken,  fading to a winding track between heather and whin  that thrust amid  the cracking stones. But still it could  be seen  that once long ago a great  paved way  had  wound upwards from  the lowlands of  the  Dwarf-kingdom.   In  places there were ruined works of stone beside the path, and mounds of green  topped with slender birches, or fir-trees sighing in  the wind. An  eastward  bend led them  hard by the sward of  Mirrormere,  and there not far from the  roadside stood a single column broken at the top.       'That  is Durin's Stone! ' cried Gimli. `I cannot  pass without turning  aside for a moment to look at the wonder of the dale! '       `Be swift  then! ' said  Aragorn, looking back towards the Gates.  `The  Sun sinks early. The Orcs will  not, maybe, come out till after dusk, but we  must be far away before nightfall. The Moon is almost spent, and it will  be  dark tonight.'       'Come with me,  Frodo! ' cried the dwarf,  springing from the  road. `I   would not have  you  go without  seeing Kheled-zvram.'  He ran down the long  green slope. Frodo followed slowly,  drawn by the still blue water in  spite  of hurt and weariness; Sam came up behind.       Beside  the  standing stone Gimli halted and looked up. It  was cracked  and weather -worn, and the faint runes upon its side could not be read. `This  pillar marks the spot where Durin first looked  in the Mirrormere,' said the  dwarf. 'Let us look ourselves once, ere we go!'       They stooped over the dark water. At first they could see nothing. Then  slowly they saw the forms of the encircling mountains mirrored in a profou nd  blue, and the peaks were like plumes of white flame above them; beyond there  was a space of sky. There like jewels sunk in the deep shone glinting stars,   though sunlight was in  the sky above. Of their own stooping forms no shadow  could be seen.       'O Kheled-zvram fair and wonderful! ' said Gimli. `There lies the Crown   of Durin till he wakes.  Farewell! ' He bowed, and turned away, and hastened  back up the green-sward to the road again.       `What  did  you see?  '  said Pippin to Sam, but  Sam was  too deep  in  thought to answer.       The road now  turned south and went quickly downwards, running out from  between the arms of  the dale. Some  way  below the mere they came on a deep   ####-well of water, clear as crystal,  from which a freshet fell over a stone lip  and ran glistening and gurgling down a steep rocky channel.       'Here is  the spring from  which the Silverlode rises.' said Gimli. `Do  not drink of it! It is icy cold.'       'Soon it becomes a swift river, and  it  gathers water from  many other   mountain-streams,' said Aragorn.  `Our road leads beside it for  many miles.   For I  shall take you  by the road that  Gandalf chose, and first I hope  to  come to  the woods  where  the  Silverlode  flows into the  Great  River -out  yonder.'  They looked as  he  pointed,  and before  them  they  could see the  stream  leaping  down to the trough of the  valley, and then  running on and  away into the lower lands, until it was lost in a golden haze.       `There  lie  the  woods of Lothlurien! '  said  Legolas. `That  is  the  fairest of all the dwellings of my people. There are no trees like the trees  of that land. For in the autumn their leaves fall not, but turn to gold. Not  till the  spring comes and  the  new green opens  do they fall, and then the  boughs are  laden with yellow flowers; and the floor of the  wood is golden,   and golden is the  roof, and its  pillars are of silver, for the bark of the  trees is smooth and grey. So still our songs in Mirkwood say. My heart would  be glad if I were beneath the eaves of that wood, and it were springtime! '       `My heart will be glad, even in the winter,' said Aragorn. 'But it lies  many miles away. Let us hasten! '       For some  time Frodo and Sam managed to keep up with  the  others;  but  Aragorn was  leading them at  a great  pace,  and  after a while they lagged  behind.  They  had eaten nothing  since  the  early morning.  Sam's cut  was  burning like fire, and his head felt light.  In spite of the shining sun the  wind seemed chill after the warm darkness of Moria.  He shivered. Frodo felt  every step more painful and he gasped for breath.       At last Legolas turned, and seeing  them  now far behind,  he spoke  to  Aragorn. The others halted, and Aragorn ran back, calling to Boromir to come  with him.       'I am sorry,  Frodo!  ' he cried, full of concern. `So much has happened  this day and we have such need of haste, that I have forgotten that you were  hurt; and Sam too. You should have spoken. We have done nothing to ease  you,  as we ought, though all the orcs of Moria were after  us. Come now! A little  further on there is a place  where we can rest for a little. There I will do  what I can for you."
