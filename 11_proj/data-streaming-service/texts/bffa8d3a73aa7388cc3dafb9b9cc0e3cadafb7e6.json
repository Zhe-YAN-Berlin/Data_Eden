'We  did not come too soon,' said Aragorn, looking  at the gates. Their  great  hinges and  iron bars were  wrenched and bent; many  of their timbers  were cracked.       'Yet we cannot stay here beyond  the walls to defend them,' said Jomer.  'Look!'  He pointed to the causeway. Already a great press of Orcs  and  Men  were  gathering again beyond the stream. Arrows whined, and  skipped on  the  stones about  them. 'Come! We must get  back and see what we  can do to pile   ####-stone and beam across the gates within. Come now!'       They  turned  and ran. At  that  moment some dozen Orcs that  had  lain  motionless among  the slain  leaped  to their feet,  and  came  silently and  swiftly behind. Two flung themselves to the ground at Jomer's heels, tripped  him,  and in a moment they were on top of him. But a  small dark figure that  none had observed sprang out of the shadows  and gave a hoarse  shout: Baruk  Khazvd! Khazvd ai-mknu! An axe swung and swept back. Two Orcs fell  headless.   The rest fled.       Jomer struggled to his feet, even as Aragorn ran back to his aid.       The postern was closed again, the iron door was barred and piled inside  with  stones. When all  were safe  within, Jomer turned: 'I thank you, Gimli  son of Gluin!' he said. 'I did not know that you were with us in the sortie.  But oft the unbidden guest proves the best company. How came you there?'       'I followed you to shake off sleep,'  said Gimli; 'but I looked on  the  hillmen  and they seemed over large for me, so  I sat  beside a stone to see  your sword-play.'       'I shall not find it easy to repay you,' said Jomer.       'There may be many a chance ere the night is over,' laughed the  Dwarf.   'But I am content. Till now I have hewn naught but wood since I left Moria.'       'Two!' said Gimli, patting his axe. He had returned to his place on the  wall.       'Two?' said Legolas. 'I have done  better, though  now I must grope for   spent arrows; all mine are gone. Yet I make my tale twenty at the least. But  that is only a few leaves in a forest.'       The  sky  now  was  quickly clearing and the sinking  moon was  shining   brightly. But the light brought little hope to  the Riders  of the Mark. The  enemy before them seemed to  have  grown rather than diminished,  still more  were  pressing up from  the valley through  the breach. The sortie  upon the  Rock gained  only a  brief respite. The  assault on the gates was redoubled.  Against the Deeping Wall the hosts of Isengard roared like a  sea.  Orcs and  hillmen swarmed about  its feet from end  to end. Ropes with grappling hooks  were hurled over the  parapet faster  than men could cut them  or fling them  back.  Hundreds of long ladders were lifted up. Many were cast down in ruin,  but many more replaced  them, and Orcs sprang up them like  apes in the dark  forests of the South. Before the wall's foot  the dead and broken were piled  like shingle in  a storm; ever higher rose the hideous mounds, and still the    ####-enemy came on.       The men of Rohan grew weary.  All their arrows  were  spent, and  every  shaft  was shot;  their swords were notched, and their shields  were  riven.  Three  times Aragorn and Jomer  rallied them, and three times AndÂ®ril flamed  in a desperate charge that drove the enemy from the wall.       Then  a  clamour arose  in the Deep  behind. Orcs had crept  like  rats  through the culvert  through  which the stream  flowed out. There  they  had  gathered in the  shadow of the cliffs, until  the assault  above was hottest   and  nearly all  the men of the defence had rushed to  the  wall's top. Then  they sprang out. Already some had passed into the jaws of  the Deep and were  among the horses, fighting with the guards.        Down from  the wall leapt Gimli with a fierce  cry  that echoed in  the  cliffs.  'Khazvd! Khazvd!' He soon had work enough.       'Ai -oi!'  he  shouted.  'The  Orcs are  behind  the  wall. Ai -oi! Come,  Legolas! There are enough for us both. Khazvd ai-mknu!'       Gamling the Old looked down  from the Hornburg, hearing the great voice  of the  dwarf above all the  tumult.  'The Orcs are in  the Deep!' he cried.  'Helm! Helm!  Forth Helmingas. he shouted as he leaped  down the  stair from  the Rock with many men of Westfold at his back.       Their  onset was fierce and sudden, and the Orcs gave way before  them.   Ere long they were hemmed in in the narrows of the gorge, and all were slain  or driven shrieking into the chasm of the Deep to fall before the  guardians  of the hidden caves.       'Twenty-one!'  cried  Gimli. He  hewed a two -handed stroke and laid the  last Orc before his feet. 'Now my count passes Master Legolas again.'       'We must stop this rat-hole,' said Gamling.  'Dwarves  are  said  to be  cunning folk with stone."
