  "text": " Above them was a dome  of pale sky  barred  with fleeting smoke,  but it seemed high and far away. as if seen through great deeps of air heavy  with brooding thought.       Not even an eagle  poised  against the sun would have marked the hobbits  sitting there, under  the weight of doom, silent, Âµ not moving, shrouded  in  their  thin  grey  cloaks. For a moment he  might  have  paused  to consider   Gollum,  a  tiny  figure sprawling  on  the ground:  there  perhaps  lay the  famished skeleton of some child of Men, its ragged garment still clinging to   it, its long arms and legs almost bone -white and bone-thin: no flesh worth a   peck.       Frodo's head  was bowed over his knees, but Sam leaned back, with hands  behind  his head, staring  out of his hood at the empty sky.  At least for a   long while it was empty. Then presently Sam thought he saw a  dark bird-like  figure wheel into the circle of his  sight, and hover, and  then wheel  away  again.  Two more followed,  and then a fourth. They were very  small to look  at,  yet  he knew,  somehow, that  they  were huge,  with a  vast stretch of  pinion,  flying  at a great height.  He covered his eyes and  bent  forward,  cowering. The same warning fear was on him as he had felt in the presence of  the Black Riders, the helpless horror that had come with the cry in the wind   ####-and the shadow on the moon, though now it was not so crushing or compelling:  the menace  was  more  remote.  But menace  it was. Frodo  felt it  too. His  thought was broken. He stirred and shivered, but he did not look up.  Gollum  huddled  himself together like a cornered spider. The winged shapes wheeled,  and stooped swiftly down, speeding back to Mordor.       Sam took a deep breath. `The Riders are a bout again, up in the air,' he  said in a hoarse whisper. 'I saw them. Do you think they  could see us? They  were very  high up. And if  they are Black Riders same as  before, then they  can't see much by daylight, can they?  '       'No, perhaps not,' said Frodo.  `But their steeds  could see. And these  winged creatures that they ride on now, they can probably  see more than any  other  creature.  They are like great  carrion birds. They  are  looking for   something: the Enemy is on the watch, I fear.'       The feeling of dread passed, but the enfolding  silence was broken. For   some  time  they had been cut  off  from  the  world, as if  in an invisible  island; now they were laid bare again, peril had returned.  But  still Frodo  did not  speak to Gollum or make h is choice. His eyes were closed, as if  he  were dreaming, or looking  inward into his  heart  and memory.  At  last  he  stirred  and  stood up,  and  it seemed that  he was  about to  speak and to  decide. But `hark!' he said. `What is that?'       A new  fear  was upon  them. They heard singing and hoarse shouting. At  first it seemed a long way off,  but it drew  nearer:  it was coming towards  them. It leaped into all their minds that the Black Wings had spied them and  had sent armed soldiers to seize  them: no speed seemed too great  for these  terrible servants of Sauron.  They  crouched, listening.  The voices and the  clink  of weapons and harness were very close.  Frodo and Sam loosened their  small swords in their sheaths. Flight was impossible.       Gollum  rose slowly and crawled insect-like to the  lip of  the hollow.  Very cautiously he raised himself inch by inch,  until he could peer over it  between  two  broken points of stone. He remained there without  moving  for   some time, making no sound.  Presen tly the voices began to recede again, and  then they slowly faded away. Far off  a  horn  blew on  the ramparts of  the  Morannon. Then quietly Gollum drew back and slipped down into the hollow.        'More  Men  going to Mordor,' he said in a low  voice. `Dark faces.  We  have not seen Men like  these before, no, Smjagol has not.  They are fierce.  They have  black  eyes, and long  black hair, and gold rings in  their ears;   yes, lots  of beautiful gold. And  some have  red paint on their cheeks, and   ####-red cloaks;  and their  flags are red, and the tips of their spears; and they  have round shields,  yellow and black with big  spikes. Not nice; very cruel  wicked Men they look. Almost as bad as Orcs, and much bigger. Smjagol  thinks  they have come out of the South beyond the Great River's end:  they came  up  that  road. They have passed  on  to the  Black Gate; but  more may  follow.   Always  more  people  coming  to Mordor.  One  day  all the peoples  will be  inside.'       `Were there any oliphaunts?' asked  Sam,  forgetting his  fear  in  his  eagerness for news of strange places.        `No, no oliphaunts. What are oliphaunts? ' said Gollum.       Sam stood up, putting his hands  behind his back (as he always did when   'speaking poetry'), and began:       Grey as a mouse,       Big as a house.       Nose like a snake,       I make the earth shake,       As I tramp through the grass;       Trees crack as I pass."
