The second part is called THE TWO TOWERS, since the events recounted  in it are dominated by ORTHANC,  the citadel  of  Saruman, and  the fortress  of MINAS MORGUL  that guards the secret entrance  to Mordor;  it  tells  of  the deeds and  perils of  all  the members of the now sundered fellowship, until  the coming of the Great Darkness.       The  third part tells of the  last defence against the Shadow,  and the  end of the mission of the Ring-bearer in  THE RETURN OF THE KING.     ####-####-         * BOOK III *    Chapter 1. The Departure of Boromir            Aragorn sped on up the hill. Every now and again he bent to the ground.  Hobbits go light, and  their  footprints are not  easy  even for a Ranger to  read, but not  far from the top a spring  crossed  the path, and in the  wet  earth he saw what he was seeking.       'I read the  signs  aright,'  he  said  to himself. 'Frodo  ran  to the  hill-top. I wonder what he  saw there? But he returned by  the same way, and  went down the hill again.'       Aragorn hesitated. He desired to go to the high seat himself, hoping to  see there something that  would guide him in his perplexities; but  time was  pressing. Suddenly he leaped  forward, and  ran to the  summit,  across  the  great flag-stones, and up the steps. Then sitting in the high seat he looked  out. But the  sun seemed darkened,  and the world dim and remote.  He turned  from the North back again to North, and saw nothing save  the distant hills,   unless it were  that far away he could see again  a great bird like an eagle  high in the air, descending slowly in wide circles down towards the earth.       Even as he  gazed his  quick ears caught sounds in the woodlands below,   on the west  side  of the River. He stiffened.  There were  cries, and among  them, to  his  horror, he  could distinguish the harsh voices of  Orcs. Then  suddenly with  a deep-throated call a great horn blew, and the  blasts of it  smote the hills and  echoed  in the hollows, rising  in a mighty shout above  the roaring of the falls.       'The horn of  Boromir!' he cried. 'He is  in need!' He  sprang down the  steps and away, leaping down the path. 'Alas! An ill fate is on me this day,  and all that I do goes amiss. Where is Sam?'       As he ran the cries  came louder, but fainter  now and  desperately the  horn was blowing. Fierce and shrill rose the yells of the Orcs, and suddenly  the horn-calls  ceased.  Aragorn  raced  down the last slope,  but before he  could reach  the hill's foot, the sounds died away;  and as he turned to the  left and ran towards them  they  retreated, until at last he could hear them  no more. Drawing  his bright sword and crying Elendil!  Elendil!  he crashed  through the trees.    ####-     A mile, maybe, from Parth Galen in a little glade not far from the lake  he found Boromir. He was sitting with his back to a great tree, as if he was  resting.  But  Aragorn saw  that he was pierced  with  many  black -feathered  arrows; his sword  was still in his hand, but it  was  broken near the hilt;  his horn cloven in two was at his side. Many Orcs lay slain, piled all about  him and at his feet.       Aragorn knelt beside him.  Boromir opened his eyes and strove to speak.  At last slow  words came. 'I tried to take the Ring from Frodo ' he said. 'I   am sorry. I have paid.' His glance strayed to his fallen enemies;  twenty at  least lay there. 'They have gone: the Halflings: the Orcs have taken them. I  think they  are  not  dead. Orcs bound them.' He paused and  his eyes closed  wearily. After a moment he spoke again.       'Farewell, Aragorn!  Go to  M inas Tirith  and  save my  people!  I have  failed.'       'No!'  said  Aragorn,  taking his hand and kissing  his brow. 'You have  conquered. Few  have gained such a  victory. Be at peace! Minas Tirith shall   not fall!'       Boromir smiled.       'Which way did they go? Was Frodo there?' said Aragorn.       But Boromir did not speak again.       'Alas!' said  Aragorn. 'Thus  passes the  heir of Denethor, Lord of the  Tower of Guard! This is a bitter end. Now the Company is all  in ruin. It is  I that  have failed. Vain was Gandalf's  trust in me.  What  shall I do now?   Boromir has laid it on  me  to go  to Minas Tirith, and my heart desires it;  but where are the  Ring and the Bearer? How shall I  find them  and save the   Quest from disaster?'       He knelt for a while, bent with weeping, still clasping Boromir's hand.  So it  was  that Legolas  and  Gimli  found him.  They came from the western  slopes of the hill, silently, creeping  through  the  trees as if  they were  hunting. Gimli had  his axe in hand,  and  Legola s  his long knife:  all his  arrows were spent. When  they came into the  glade they halted in amazement;  and  then they stood a moment with heads bowed  in  grief,  for it seemed to  them plain what had happened."
