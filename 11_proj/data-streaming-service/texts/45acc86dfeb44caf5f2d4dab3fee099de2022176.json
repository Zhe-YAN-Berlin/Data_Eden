It was  a   sore trial  for such a man: a warrior, and a  lord of men. Galadriel told me  that he was in peril. But  he escaped in the end.  I am glad. It was  not in  vain that  the  young hobbits  came with us, if only for Boromir's sake. But  that is not the  only part they have to play. They were brought  to Fangorn,  and  their coming  was like  the  falling  of  small stones  that starts  an  avalanche  in  the  mountains. Even  a s  we talk  here,  I  hear  the  first  rumblings. Saruman  had  best  not be caught  away  from  home  when the dam  bursts!'       'In one thing you  have not changed, dear friend,' said  Aragorn:  'you   still speak in riddles.'       'What?  In riddles?'  sa id  Gandalf. 'No!  For I was talking  aloud  to  myself. A habit of the old: they choose  the wisest  person present to speak  to; the long explanations needed by the young are wearying.' He laughed, but  the sound now seemed warm and kindly as a gleam of sunshine.       'I am  no longer  young even  in the  reckoning of  Men of the  Ancient  Houses,' said Aragorn. 'Will you not open your mind more clearly to me?'       'What  then shall  I say?'  said Gandalf, and  paused  for a  while  in  thought. 'This in brief is how  I  see things at the moment, if you wish  to  have a piece of my mind as plain as possible. The Enemy, of course, has long  known that the Ring  is abroad, and that it is  borne by a  hobbit. He knows  now the number  of our  Company that set out fr om Rivendell, and the kind of  each of us.  But he does  not yet  perceive our purpose clearly. He supposes  that we were all going  to Minas Tirith; for that is what he  would  himself  have done in our  place. And according to  his wisdom  it would have  been a  heavy stroke against his power. Indeed he is in great fear, not knowing what  mighty  one  may suddenly  appear, wielding the Ring, and assailing him with  war, seeking to cast him  down and take his  place. That we  should wish  to  cast him down and have no one in his place is not a thought that  occurs  to  his  mind. That we should try to destroy the Ring itself has not yet entered  into his darkest dream. In which no doubt you will see our good fortune  and   our hope. For imagining war he has let loose war,  believing  that he has no   ####-time to  waste; for he  that  strikes the  first blow, if he strikes it hard  enough, may need  to strike no  more.  So the forces that he has  long  been  preparing he is now  setting in motion, sooner than he intended.  Wise  fool.  For if he had used all his power to guard Mordor,  so that none could enter,  and bent  all his guild  to the hunting of the  Ring, then indeed hope would  have faded: neither  Ring nor Bearer could long have eluded him. But now his  eye gazes abroad rather than near at home; and mostly he looks towards Minas  Tirith. Very soon now his strength will fall upon it like a storm.       'For  already he knows that the messengers that  he  sent to waylay the  Company have  failed again. They have not  found the Ring. Neither have they  brought away any hobbits as hostages. Had they done even so much as that, it  would have been a heavy blow to us, and it might have been fatal. But let us  not darken  our hearts by imagining the trial of their gentle loyalty in the  Dark Tower. For the Enemy has failed-so far. Thanks to Saruman:'       'Then is not Saruman a traitor?' said Gimli.       'Indeed yes,' said Gandalf.  'Doubly. And is  not that strange? Nothing  that  we have endured of  late has seemed  so grievous  as  the  treason  of  Isengard. Even reckoned as a lord and captain Saruman has grown very strong.  He threatens the Men of  Rohan and draws  off their help from Minas  Tirith,  even as the main blow is approaching from the East. Yet a treacherous weapon  is ever a danger to the hand.  Saruman also had a mind to capture  the Ring,  for  himself,  or  at least to snare  some hobbits for his evil purposes. So  between them our enemies have contrived only to  bring Merry and Pippin with  marvellous speed, and in the  nick of time, to Fangorn, where otherwise they   would never have come at all!       'Also they have  filled  themselves with new doubts that  disturb their  plans. No tidings of  the battle will come to Mordor, thanks to the horsemen   of Rohan;  but the Dark Lord knows that two hobbits were  taken in the  Emyn  Muil  and borne away  towards Isengard against the will of his own servants.  He now has Isengard to fear as  well as Minas Tirith. If Minas Tirith falls,   it will go ill with Saruman.'       'It is a pity that our  friends lie in between,' said Gimli. 'If no land  divided Isengard  and Mordor, then  they could  fight  while we watched  and  waited.'       'The victor would emerge  stronger  than either, and  free from doubt,'  said  Gandalf.  'But  Isengard  cannot  figh t  Mordor,  unless Saruman first   obtains the Ring."
