Crying farewell, the Elves of Lurien with long  grey poles   ####-thrust them out into the flowing stream, and  the rippling waters bore  them  slowly  away. The  travellers  sat still  without moving or speaking. On the  green  bank near to the very point  of the Tongue  the  Lady Galadriel stood  alone and silent. As they passed her they  turned and their eyes watched her   slowly  floating away  from  them.  For  so it seemed  to  them:  Lurien was  slipping  backward, like a bright ship masted with enchanted trees,  sailing  on to forgotten shores, while they sat  helpless upon the margin of the grey  and leafless world.       Even as they gazed,  the Silverlode passed out into the currents of the  Great River, and their boats turned  and began to speed southwards. Soon the  white form of the Lady  was small and  distant. She  shone like a window  of  glass  upon a far hill in the westering sun, or as a remote lake seen from a   mountain: a  crystal fallen in the lap of the land. Then  it seemed to Frodo  that she lifted her arms in a  final farewell, and far but piercing-clear on  the following wind came the sound of her voice singing. But now she  sang in  the  ancient tongue of the Elves  beyond the Sea, and he  did not understand   the words: fair was the music, but it did not comfort him.       Yet as is the way of Elvish words, they remained  graven in his memory,   and long afterwards he interpreted  them, as well as he could:  the language  was that of Elven -song and spoke of things little known on Middle-earth.       Ai! lauril lantar lassi s速rinen,       Yjni 速nutiml ve rbmar aldaron!       Yjni ve lintl yuldar avbnier       mi oromardi lisse-miruvureva       And速nl pella, Vardo tellumar       nu luini yassen tintilar i eleni       umaryo airetbri-lnrinen.         Sn man i yulma nin enquantuva?         An sn Tintalll Varda Oiolosslo        ve fanyar mbryat Elentbri ortanl       ar ilyl tier undulbvl lumbull;       ar sindanuriello caita mornil       i falmalinnar imbl met, ar hnsil       unt速pa Calaciryo mnri oiall.       Si vanwa nb, Rumello vanwa, Valimar!   ####-     Nambril! Nai hiruvalyl Valimar.       Nai elyl hiruva. Nambril!       `Ah! like gold fall the leaves in the  wind,  long years numberless  as  the  wings of trees!  The long years have passed like  swift draughts of the  sweet mead in lofty halls beyond the West, beneath the blue  vaults of Varda   wherein the stars  tremble  in the  song of her voice, holy and queenly. Who   now shall refill  the cup for me? For now the Kindler, Varda,  the  Queen of  the Stars,  from Mount Everwhite has uplifted her hands like clouds, and all   paths are drowned deep in shadow; and out of a grey country darkness lies on  the foaming waves between  us, and mist  covers the jewels of Calacirya  for   ever. Now lost, lost to those from the East is Valimar! Farewell! Maybe thou  shalt find Valimar. Maybe even thou shalt find it. Farewell!  ' Varda is the  name of that Lady whom the Elves in these lands of exile name Elbereth.       Suddenly the River  swept round a bend, and the banks rose  upon either  side, and the light of Lurien was hidden. To that fair land Frodo never came  again.       The travellers  now  turned their faces  to  the journey;  the  sun was  before  them, and their  eyes were dazzled, for all were  filled with tears.  Gimli wept openly.       `I have  looked  the  last  upon that which was  fairest,' he  said  to  Legolas his companion. `Henceforward I will call  nothing fair, unless it be  her gift.' He put his hand to his breast.       `Tell me,  Legolas, why  did I  come on this Quest?  Little did I  know  where  the  chief peril  lay!  Truly Elrond spoke, saying that we  could not  foresee what we might meet upon our road. Torment in the dark was the danger  that I feared, and it did not hold me back. But I would not have come, had I  known the  danger of light and joy. Now I have taken my worst wound in  this  parting, even if I were to go this night straight to the Dark Lord. Alas for  Gimli son of Gluin! '       `Nay! ' said Legolas. `Alas for us all! And for all that walk the world  in these after -days. For  such is the  way of  it:  to find and lose,  as it  seems to those whose boat is on the running stream. But I count you blessed,  Gimli son of Gluin: for your loss you suffer of your own  free will, and you   might have chosen otherwise. But you have not forsaken  your companions,  and  the least reward that you shall have is that  the memory of Lothlurien shall  remain ever clear  and unstained in your heart, and  shall neither  fade nor    ####-grow stale.'       `Maybe,' said  Gimli;  `and  I  thank you  for  your words.  True words  doubtless; yet all  such  comfort  is cold.  Memory  is not  what  the heart  desires. That is only a mirror, be it clear as Kheled-zvram. Or  so says the  heart  of Gimli  the Dwarf. Elves  may see  things otherwise."
