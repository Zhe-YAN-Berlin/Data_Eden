  "text": " War has a lready begun.'       For a while the king sat silent. At last he spoke. 'So we come to it in  the end,' he said: 'the great battle of our time, in which many things shall  pass away. But at least there is no longer need for hiding. We will ride the  straight  way  and  the  open road and with all our  speed. The muster shall  begin  at once, and wait for none that tarry. Have  you good  store in Minas  Tirith? For if we must ride now in all haste, then we must  ride light, with  but meal and water enough to last u s into battle.'       'We have very great store long prepared,' answered  Hirgon. Ride now as  light and as swift as you may!'       'Then call  the  heralds,  Jomer,' said  Thjoden. 'Let  the  Riders  be  marshalled!'       Jomer  went out, and presently  the trumpets rang  in the Hold and were  answered by many others from below; but their voices no longer sounded clear  and brave as they had seemed to Merry the night before. Dull they seemed and  harsh in the heavy air, braying ominously.       The  king  turned to Merry. 'I am going  to  war,  Master Meriadoc,' he  said.  'In  a  little while I shall take  the  road.  I release you from  my  service, but not from my friendship.  You shall abide here, and if you will,  you shall serve the Lady Jowyn, who will govern the folk in my stead.'       'But, but, lord,' Merry  stammered, 'I offered you my sword.  I do  not  want  to be parted  from you like this, Thjoden King. And as all my  friends  have gone to the battle' I should be ashamed to stay behind.'       'But we ride on horses tall and swift,' said Thjoden; 'and great though  your heart be, you cannot ride on such beasts.'       'Then tie me on  to the back of one,  or let me hang  on a  stirrup, or   something,' said Merry. 'It  is a long way to  run; but  run  I shall, if  I  cannot ride, even if I wear my feet off and arrive weeks too late.'       Thjoden smiled.  'Rather  than  that  I  would  bear  you  with  me  on  Snowmane,'  he said. 'But at the least you shall ride with me to  Edoras and  look on Meduseld;  for that way I  shall go. So far Stybba can bear you: the  great race will not begin till we reach the plains.'       Then Jowyn rose  up. 'Come now,  Meriadoc!' she said. 'I will show  you    ####-the gear that  I have  prepared  fur  you.' They  went out  together.  'This  request only did  Aragorn make to me,' said Jowyn, as  they passed among the  tents, 'that you should be armed for battle. I have  granted it, as I could.  For my heart tells me that you will need such gear ere the end.'       Now she led Merry to a booth among the lodges of the king's  guard  and  there an armourer brought out to her a  small  helm, and a round shield, and  other gear.       'No mail have we to fit you,' said Jowyn, 'nor any time for the forging  of such a hauberk; but here is also a stout jerkin of leather, a belt, and a   knife. A sword you have.'       Merry bowed,  and  the lady showed  him  the shield, which was like the  shield that had  been given  to Gimli, and  it bore on  it the device of the  white horse. 'Take  all  these things,' she  said, 'and  bear  them  to good  fortune! Farewell now, Master  Meriadoc! Yet maybe we  shall meet again, you   and I.'       So  it was that amid a  gathering gloom the King of the Mark made ready  to lead  all  his  Riders on  the eastward road. Hearts were heavy  and  many  quailed  in the shadow. But they were  a stern people, loyal to  their lord,  and  little weeping or  murmuring was heard, even in  the  camp in  the Hold  where the exiles from Edoras  were housed, women and children  and old  men.  Doom hung over  them, but they faced it silently.       Two  swift hours passed, and now the king  sat  upon  his  white horse,  glimmering in the half light. Proud and tall he seemed, though the hair that  flowed beneath his high helm was  like  snow; and  many marvelled a t him and  took heart to see him unbent and unafraid.       There on the wide  flats beside the noisy river were marshalled in many  companies well nigh five and fifty  hundreds of Riders fully armed, and many  hundreds of other men  with spare  horses lightly burdened. A single trumpet  sounded. The king raised his  hand, and then silently  the host  of the Mark  began to  move. Foremost went twelve of the king's household-men,  Riders of  renown. Then the king followed with Jomer on his right. He had said farewell  to Jowyn above in  the Hold, and the  memory was grievous; but now he turned  his mind to the  road that lay ahead. Behind him Merry  rode  on Stybba with  the errand riders of Gondor, and behind them again twelve more of the king's  household. They passed  down  the long ranks of  waiting  men with stern  and  unmoved faces.  But when they had  come  almost  to the end of  the line one  looked up  glancing  keenly at the hobbit. A young man,  Merry thought as he   ####-returned the glance, less in height and girth than most. He caught the glint  of clear grey eyes; and then he  shivered, for  it came suddenly to him that  it was the face of one without hope who goes in search of death."
