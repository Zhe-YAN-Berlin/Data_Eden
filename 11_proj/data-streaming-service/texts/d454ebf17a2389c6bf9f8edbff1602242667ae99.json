The throbbing  grew to a great tumult,  and the  Mountain  shook. Sam ran to Frodo and picked him up and carried him. out to the  door.  And there upon the dark threshold of the Sammath Naur, high above the plains  of Mordor, such wonder and terror came on him that he stood still forgetting  all else, and gazed as one turned to st one.       A brief vision he had of  swirling cloud, and in the midst of it towers  and battlements, tall as  hills, founded upon a mighty mountain-throne above  immeasurable pits;  great  courts and  dungeons, eyeless  prisons  sheer  as  cliffs, and gaping gates of steel and adamant: and then  all passed.  Towers  fell  and  mountains slid;  walls crumbled and melted,  crashing down;  vast  spires  of  smoke and  spouting  steams  went  billowing  up, up, until they  toppled  like  an overwhelming  wave, and  its  wild  crest  curled and came  foaming down  upon the land. And then at last  over  the miles between there  came a rumble, rising to a deafening  crash  and roar;  the earth shook, the  plain heaved and  cracked, and Orodruin reeled. Fire belched from its   riven  summit.  The  skies  burst  into  thunder seared  with lightning. Down  like  lashing whips fell a torrent of black rain. And into the heart of the storm,  with a cry that pierced all  other  sounds, tearing the clouds asunder,  the  Nazgyl came, shooting  like  flaming bolts, as  caught in the  fiery ruin of  hill and sky they crackled, withered, and went out.       'Well,  this  is the end, Sam Gamgee,'  said a  voice by his side.  And  there was Frodo, pale and worn, and yet himself again; and in his eyes there  was peace now, neither strain of will, nor madness, nor any fear. His burden   ####-was taken away. There was the dear master of the sweet days in the Shire.       'Master!' cried  Sam. and fell upon his knees. In all that ruin  of the  world for the momen t he  felt only joy, great joy. The burden  was gone. His  master had  been  saved;  he was  himself again, he was free. And  then  Sam  caught sight of the maimed and bleeding hand.       'Your poor hand!'  he said.  'And I have nothing to  bind it  with,  or  comfort it.  I would have  spared him  a whole hand of mine rather. But he's  gone now beyond recall, gone for ever.'       'Yes,'  said Frodo. 'But do  you remember Gandalf's words: Even  Gollum  may  have something  yet to do? But for him, Sam, I could not have destroyed  the Ring. The Quest would  have been in vain, even at the bitter end. So let  us forgive  him!  For the Quest  is achieved, and now all is over. I am glad  you are here with me. Here at the end of all things, Sam.'   ####-     Chapter 4. The Field of Cormallen            All about the hills the hosts of Mordor raged. The Captains of the West   were foundering in a gathering sea. The sun gleamed red, and under the wings  of the Nazgyl  the shadows of death fell dark upon the earth. Aragorn  stood  beneath his  banner,  silent and stern, as one lost in thought of things long  past or far away; but his eyes gleamed like stars that shine the brighter as  the  night deepens.  Upon the hill-top stood Gandalf,  and  he was white and  cold and no shadow fell on him. The onslaught of Mordor broke like a wave on  the beleaguered hills,  voices roaring like a tide amid the  wreck and crash  of arms.        As  if to his eyes some sudden vision had  been given, Gandalf stirred;  and  he turned, looking back north where the skies were pale and clear. Then  he lifted up his hands and cried in  a loud voice ringing above the din: The  Eagles are coming! And many voices answered crying:  The  Eagles are  coming!  The Eagles are  coming! The hosts of Mordor looked up and wondered what  this  sign might mean.       There came Gwaihir the Windlord, and Landroval his brother, greatest of   all the Eagles of  the North, mightiest of the descendants of old Thorondor,  who built his eyries in the inaccessible peaks of the  Encircling  Mountains  when Middle-earth was young. Behind  them in long swift lines came all their  vassals  from the northern mountains, speeding on a gathering wind. Straight  down  upon the Nazgyl they bore, stooping suddenly out of the high airs, and  the rush of their wide wings as they passed over was like a gale.       But the  Nazgyl  turned and  fled, and vanished into  Mordor's shadows,  hearing  a sudden terrible  call  out of the  Dark Tower; and  even  at that  moment  all the hosts of Mordor trembled, doubt clutched their hearts,  their  laughter  failed, their hands shook  and their limbs were loosed.  The Power   that drove them on and filled them with hate and fury was wavering, its will   was removed from them; and now looking in the eyes of their enemies they  saw  a deadly light and were afraid.   ####-     Then all the Captains  of  the West cried aloud, for their hearts  were  filled  with a  new hope in the midst of darkness."
