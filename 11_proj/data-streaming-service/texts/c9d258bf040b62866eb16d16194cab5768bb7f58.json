  "text": " He was thinking of the fabled  Cracks of Doom  and the terror of the Fiery Mountain.       'Well!'  said Gandalf at last.  'What are you  thinking about? Have you   decided what to do?'       'No!'  answered Frodo,  coming back to himself  out  of  darkness,  and  finding to his surprise that it was not dark, and that out of the  window he  could see the sunlit garden.   'Or perhaps, yes.  As far as I understand what  you have said, I suppose I must keep the Ring and guard it, at least for the  present, whatever it may do to me.'       'Whatever it may do, it will be slow, slow to evil, if you keep it with  that purpose,' said  Gandalf.        'I hope so,'  said Frodo.  'But I  hope  that  you may  find some other    ####-better  keeper soon. But in the meanwhile it  seems that I  am  a  danger, a   danger  to all that live near  me.  I cannot  keep the Ring and stay here. I  ought to leave   Bag End,  leave the Shire, leave everything and go away.' He  sighed.       'I should like to  save  the Shire, if I could  - though there have been  times when I thought the inhabitants too stupid and dull for words, and have  felt that an earthquake or  an invasion of dragons might  be good  for them.  But  I don't feel  like that  now. I feel  that  as  long as the Shire  lies  behind, safe and comfortable, I shall find  wandering more bearable: I shall  know that somewhere there is a firm  foothold, even if my feet  cannot stand  there again.       'Of course, I have sometimes thought of going away, but I imagined that  as a kind of holiday, a series of adventures like Bilbo's  or better, ending  in  peace. But this  would  mean exile,  a  flight from danger into  danger,  drawing  it after me. And I suppose I  must go alone, if I am to do that and  save  the Shire.  But I  feel very  small, and  very  uprooted,  and  well -  desperate. The Enemy is so strong and terrible.'       He did  not tell  Gandalf, but as  he  was speaking a  great desire  to  follow  Bilbo flamed up in his heart  - to follow Bilbo, and even perhaps  to  find him again. It was so strong that it overcame his fear: he  could almost   have run out there and then down the road without his hat, as Bilbo ha d done  on a similar morning long ago.       'My  dear  Frodo!'  exclaimed  Gandalf.  'Hobbits  really  are  amazing  creatures, as I have said before. You  can learn all that there  is  to know  about their  ways in a month, and yet after  a hundred  years they can still  surprise you at a pinch. I hardly expected to get  such  an answer, not even  from  you. But Bilbo made no mistake in choosing his heir, though  he little  thought how important it  would prove. I am afraid  you are  right. The Ring  will not be able to stay hidden in the  Shire much longer; and for  your own  sake, as  well  as  for others, you  will have to go, and leave the  name of  Baggins behind you. That name will not be safe to have, outside the Shire or   in the Wild. I will give  you a travelling name now. When you go, go as  Mr.  Underhill.       'But I don't think you need go alone. Not if you know of anyone you can  trust, and who would be willing  to go by your side  -  and that you would be  willing to take  into unknown perils.  But  if you look for a  companion, be  careful in choosing! And be  careful of what  you say,  even to your closest    ####-friends! The enemy has many spies and many ways of hearing.'       Suddenly he  stopped as if  listening.  Frodo became aware that all was  very quiet,  inside and  outside. Gandalf  crept to one side of  the window.   Then with  a  dart he  sprang to  the sill,  and thrust a  long arm out  and  downwards. There was a squawk, and up came Sam Gamgee's curly head  hauled by  one ear.       'Well, well, bless my beard!' said Gandalf. 'Sam Gamgee is it? Now what  may you be doing?'       'Lor bless  you, Mr. Gandalf, sir!' said Sam. 'Nothing! Leastways I was  just  trimming the grass-border  under  the window,  if you  follow me.'  He  picked up his shears and exhibited them as evidence.       'I don't,' said Gandalf grimly. It is some time  since I last heard the  sound of your shears. How long have you been eavesdropping?'       'Eavesdropping,  sir? I don't  follow you, begging  your pardon.  There  ain't no eaves at Bag End, and that's a fact.'       'Don't be  a  fool! What  have  you  heard,  and why  did you  listen?'  Gandalf's eyes flashed and his brows stuck out like bristles.        'Mr. Frodo, sir!' cried Sam quaking. 'Don't let him hurt me, sir! Don't   let  him turn  me  into anything unnatural!  My old  dad would take on so. I  meant no harm, on my honour, sir!'       'He  won't hurt you,' said Frodo,  hardly able to keep  from  laughing,  although he was himself startled and rather puzzled. 'He knows, as well as I   do, that you mean no harm. But just you up and answer his questions straight  away!'       'Well, sir,' said Sam dithering a little. 'I heard a deal that I didn't  rightly  understand,  about an  enemy, and  rings, and  Mr."
