  "text": "  Sirius, I need you to set off at once.  You are to alert Remus Lupin, Arabella Figg, Mundungus Fletcher - the old crowd.  Lie low at Lupin's for a while; I will contact you there.\" \"But -\" said Harry. He wanted Sirius to stay.  He did not want to have to say goodbye again so quickly. \"You'll see me very soon. Harry,\" said Sirius, turning to him.  \"I promise you.  But I must do what I can, you understand, don't you?\" \"Yeah,\" said Harry.  \"Yeah . . . of course I do.\" Sirius grasped his hand briefly, nodded to Dumbledore, transformed again into the black dog, and ran the length of the room to the door, whose handle he turned with a paw.  Then he was gone. \"Severus,\" said Dumbledore, turning to Snape, \"you know what I must ask you to do.  If you are ready . . . if you are prepared ...\" \"I am,\" said Snape. He looked slightly paler than usual, and his cold, black eyes glittered strangely. \"Then good luck,\" said Dumbledore, and he watched, with a trace of apprehension on his face, as Snape swept wordlessly after Sirius. It was several minutes before Dumbledore spoke again. \"I must go downstairs,\" he said finally.  \"I must see the Diggorys.  Harry - take the rest of your potion.  I will see all of you later.\" Harry slumped back against his pillows as Dumbledore disappeared.  Hermione, Ron, and Mrs. Weasley were all looking at him.  None of them spoke for a very long time. \"You've got to take the rest of your potion. Harry,\" Mrs. Weasley said at last.  Her hand nudged the sack of gold on his bedside cabinet as she reached for the bottle and the goblet.  \"You have a good long sleep.  Try and think about something else for a while . . . think about what you're going to buy with your winnings!\" \"I don't want that gold,\" said Harry in an expressionless voice.  \"You have it.  Anyone can have it.  I shouldn't have won it.  It should've been Cedric's.\" The thing against which he had been fighting on and off ever since he had come out of the maze was threatening to overpower him.  He could feel a burning, prickling feeling in the inner corners of his eyes.  He blinked and stared up at the ceiling. \"It wasn't your fault. Harry,\" Mrs. Weasley whispered. \"I told him to take the cup with me,\" said Harry. Now the burning feeling was in his throat too.  He wished Ron would look away. Mrs. Weasley set the potion down on the bedside cabinet, bent down, and put her arms around Harry.  He had no memory of ever being hugged like this, as though by a mother.  The full weight of everything he had seen that night seemed to fall in upon him as Mrs. Weasley held him to her.  His mother s face, his father's voice, the sight of Cedric, dead on the ground all started spinning in his head until he could hardly bear it, until he was screwing up his face against the howl of misery fighting to get out of him. There was a loud slamming noise, and Mrs. Weasley and Harry broke apart.  Hermione was standing by the window.  She was holding something tight in her hand. \"Sorry,\" she whispered. \"Your potion, Harry,\" said Mrs. Weasley quickly, wiping her eyes on the back of her hand. Harry drank it in one gulp.  The effect was instantaneous.  Heavy, irresistible waves of dreamless sleep broke over him; he fell back onto his pillows and thought no more.  CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN - THE BEGINNING  When he looked back, even a month later, Harry found he had only scattered memories of the next few days.  It was as though he had been through too much to take in any more.  The recollections he did have were very painful.  The worst, perhaps, was the meeting with the Diggorys that took place the following morning. They did not blame him for what had happened; on the contrary, both thanked him for returning Cedric's body to them.  Mr. Diggory sobbed through most of the interview.  Mrs. Diggory's grief seemed to be beyond tears. \"He suffered very little then,\" she said, when Harry had told her how Cedric had died. \"And after all, Amos ... he died just when he'd won the tournament.  He must have been happy.\" When they got to their feet, she looked down at Harry and said, \"You look after yourself, now.\" Harry seized the sack of gold on the bedside table. \"You take this,\" he muttered to her.  \"It should've been Cedric's, he got there first, you take it -\"  But she backed away from him. \"Oh no, it's yours, dear, I couldn't. . . you keep it.\"  Harry returned to Gryffindor Tower the following evening.  From what Hermione and Ron told him, Dumbledore had spoken to the school that morning at breakfast.  He had merely requested that they leave Harry alone, that nobody ask him questions or badger him to tell the story of what had happened in the maze.  Most people, he noticed, were skirting him in the corridors, avoiding his eyes.  Some whispered behind their hands as he passed.  He guessed that many of them had believed Rita Skeeter's article about how disturbed and possibly dangerous he was.  Perhaps they were formulating their own theories about how Cedric had died.  He found he didn't care very much."
