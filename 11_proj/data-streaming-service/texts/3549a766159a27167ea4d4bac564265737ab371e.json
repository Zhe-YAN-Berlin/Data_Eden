He cowered against the stony bank.       A long-tilted  valley, a  deep gulf of shadow,  ran back far  into  the  mountains. Upon the further side, some way  within the valley's arms high on  a  rocky seat upon the black knees  of  the Ephel DÂ®ath, stood the walls and   tower of Minas Morgul. All was dark about it, earth and sky, but it  was lit  with light. Not the imprisoned moonlight welling through the marble walls of  Minas  Ithil long ago, Tower of the  Moon, fair and radiant in the hollow of  the hills. Paler  indeed than  the moon ailing in some  slow eclipse was the  light of it now, wavering and blowing like a  noisome exhalation of decay, a   corpse-light, a light that  illuminated  nothing.  In  the  walls  and tower   windows showed, like countless black holes  looking inward  into  emptiness;   but  the topmost course of the tower revolved slowly, first one way and then  another, a huge ghostly head  leering into the night. For a moment the three  companions  stood there, shrinking,  staring  up with unwilling eyes. Gollum  was the first to recover. Again he pulled  at their cloaks urgently,  but he  spoke no word. Almost he dragged them forward. Every step was reluctant, and  time seemed to slow its pace. so that between the raising of a foot  and the   ####-setting of it down minutes of loathing passed.       So they came  slowly  to the  white  bridge.  Here  the  road, gleaming  faintly,  passed over the  stream  in the midst of the valley, and went  on,  winding  deviously up towards the city's gate: a black  mouth opening in the  outer circle of the  northward walls. Wide flats lay on either bank, shadowy  meads filled with pale white flowers. Luminous these were too, beautiful and  yet horrible of shape, like the demented  forms in an uneasy dream; and they   gave forth a  faint sickening charnel-smell; an  odour  of rottenness filled  the  air. From  mead to mead  the  bridge sprang. Figures stood there at its  head, carven  with cunning  in forms human  and bestial, but all corrupt and   loathsome.  The water flowing  beneath was  silent, and  it steamed, but the  vapour that  rose from it, curling and twisting about the bridge, was deadly  cold. Frodo felt his senses  reeling and his mind darkening. Then  suddenly,  as if some force were  at work other than his own will, he began  to  hurry,  tottering forward, his groping hands held out, his head lolling from side to  side. Both Sam and Gollum ran after him. Sam caught his  master in his arms,   as he stumbled and almost fell, right on the threshold of the bridge.       `Not  that way! No, not that  way! '  whispered  Gollum, but the breath  between  his teeth seemed to tear the heavy stillness like a whistle, and he  cowered to the ground in terror.       `Hold  up,  Mr. Frodo! ' muttered Sam  in  Frodo's ear. 'Come back! Not  that way. Gollum says not, and for once I agree with him.'       Frodo passed his hand over his brow and wrenched his eyes away from the  city  on the  hill.  The luminous  tower fascinated him,  and he fought  the  desire that was on him to run up the gleaming road towards its gate. At last   with an effort he turned back, and as  he did so, he felt the Ring resisting  him, dragging  at the chain about his  neck; and his  eyes too, as he looked  away, seemed for the moment to  have  been blinded.  The darkness before him  was impenetrable.       Gollum, crawling on  the ground like  a frightened animal, was  already  vanishing into the gloom. Sam, supporting and guiding his  stumbling master,  followed after him as quickly as he could. Not far from the near bank of the   stream there was a gap in the stone-wall beside the road. Through this  they  passed, and Sam saw that they were on a narrow  path that gleamed faintly at  first, as  the main road  did,  until  climb ing  above  the meads of  deadly  flowers it faded and went dark, winding its crooked way up into the northern  sides of the valley.   ####-     Along this path the hobbits trudged, side by side, unable to see Gollum  in front of  them, except when  he turned back to  beckon them  on. Then his  eyes  shone  with  a green-white light, reflecting  the noisome Morgul-sheen  perhaps, or kindled by some answering mood within. Of that deadly gleam  and  of  the dark eyeholes Frodo  and Sam  were  always conscious,  ever glancing  fearfully over their shoulders,  and  ever dragging their eyes  back to find  the darkening path. Slowly  they laboured on. As they rose  above the stench   and vapours of  the poisonous stream their  breath  became easier and  their  heads clearer; but now their limbs were deadly tired, as  if they had walked  all night under a burden, or had been swimming long against a heavy  tide of  water. At last they could go no further without a halt.       Frodo stopped and  sat down on a stone."
