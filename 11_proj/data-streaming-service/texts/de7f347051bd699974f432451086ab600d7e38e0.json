Inside  it was damp and cheerless, and supper  was served on a long  bare table that  had not been scrubbed  for weeks. The  food  deserved no better  setting. The travellers  were  glad  to  leave the  place.  It was about eighteen  miles to  Bywater,  and they  set off at  ten  o'clock  in the morning. They  would have started earlier, only the delay so  plainly annoyed the Shirriff-leader. The west wind had shifted northward and  it was turning colder, but the rain was gone.       It was rather  a comic  cavalcade that left the village, though the few  folk that came out to  stare at the  'get-up' of the travellers did not seem  quite sure whether laughing was allowed. A dozen Shirriffs had been told off  as escort to the  'prisoners'; but Merry made  them  march  in front,  while  Frodo and his friends rode behind. Merry, Pippin, and  Sam sat at their ease  laughing and talking  and singing, while the Shirriffs stumped along  trying  to  look stern and important. Frodo, however, was  silent  and looked rather   sad and thoughtful.   ####-     The last person  they passed was a sturdy  old gaffer clipping a hedge.  'Hullo, hu llo!' he jeered. 'Now who's arrested who?'       Two of the Shirriffs immediately  left the  party and went towards him.  'Leader!' said  Merry. 'Order your  fellows back to their places at once, if  you don't want me to deal with them!'       The two hobbits at a sharp word from the leader came back sulkily. 'Now  get on!' said Merry,  and after that  the  travellers  saw  to it that their  ponies'  pace was quick enough to  push  the Shirriffs along as fast as they  could go. The sun came out,  and in spite of the  chilly wind they were soon   puffing and sweating.       At  the Three-Farthing  Stone they  gave  it  up.  They had done nearly  fourteen  miles with only one rest  at noon. It was now three  o'clock. They  were hungry and very footsore and they could not  stand the pace.       'Well, come along in your own time!' said Merry. 'We are going on.'       'Good-bye, Cock -robin!' said Sam. 'I'll wait for you outside  The Green  Dragon, if you haven't forgotten where that is. Don't dawdle on the way!'       'You're  br eaking  arrest,  that's what you're doing,'  said the leader   ruefully, 'and I can't be answerable.'       'We shall  break  a  good many things  yet, and not ask you to answer '  said Pippin. 'Good luck to you!'       The  travellers trotted on, and as the  sun began to  sink towards  the  White Downs far away on the western horizon they came to Bywater by its  wide  pool; and there  they had their first really  painful shock. This  was Frodo  and Sam's own country, and they found out  now that they cared about it  more  than any other place in  the world. Many  of  the houses that they had known   were missing. Some seemed to  have been burned down. The pleasant row of  old  hobbit-holes in the  bank on the north  side  of the Pool were deserted, and  their little  gardens that used to run down bright to the water's  edge were  rank with weeds. Worse,  there was a whole line  of the ugly new houses  all  along Pool Side, where the Hobbiton Road ran close to the bank. An avenue of  trees had stood there. They were all  gone.   And  looking with dismay up the  road towards Bag  End they saw  a  tall chimney of brick in the distance. It  was pouring out black smoke into the evening air.       Sam was beside himself. 'I'm going right on, Mr. Frodo!' he cried. 'I'm  going to see what's up. I want to find my gaffer.'   ####-     'We  ought  to find  out first what we're in for, Sam,'  said Merry. 'I   guess  that  the \"Chief\" will have a gang of ruffians handy.  We  had better   find someone who will tell us how things are round here.'       But in the village of Bywater all  the houses and holes  were shut, and  no  one greeted them. They wondered  at  this, but they soon  discovered the  reason  of  it. When they  reached  The Green Dragon, the last house  on the  Hobbiton side, now lifeless and with broken  windows, they were disturbed to  see half a dozen  large ill-favoured Men lounging against the inn-wall; they  were squint-eyed and sallow-faced.       'Like that friend of Bill Ferny's at Bree,' said Sam.       'Like many that I saw at Isengard,' muttered Merry.       The ruffians had clubs in their  hands  and  horns by their  belts, but  they had no other weapons, as far as could be seen.  As the  travellers rode  up they left the wall and walked into the road, blocking the way.       'Where d'you  think   you're  going?'  said  one,  the largest and  most   evil-looking of the crew.  'There's no road for you any  further.  And where  are those precious Shirriffs?'       'Coming along nicely,'  said  Merry.  'A  little  footsore, perhaps. We  promised to wait for them here.'       'Garn, what did I  say?' said the ruffian to his mates. 'I told Sharkey  it was no  good trusting those little fools."
