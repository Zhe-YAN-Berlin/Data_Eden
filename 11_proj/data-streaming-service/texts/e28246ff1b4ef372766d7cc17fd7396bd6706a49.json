Strange furtive noises ran among the bushes and reeds on  either  side of them; and if  they looked  up  to the pale sky,  they caught  sight  of  queer  gnarled  and knobbly  faces that gloomed dark against  the  twilight,  and leered down at them  from the high bank and the edges of  the  wood. They  began to feel that  all this  country was unreal,  and that they  were stumbling through an ominous dream that led to no awakening.       Just as they felt their feet slowing down to a standstill, they noticed  that the  ground  was  gently  rising.  The  water  began to murmur. In  the  darkness they caught the white glimmer of foam, where the  river flowed over   a short fall. Then suddenly the trees came to an end and the mists were left   behind. They  stepped out from the  Forest, and found a wide sweep  of grass  welling up before them. The  river, now small and swift, was leaping merrily  down to meet them, glinting here and there in the light of the stars,  which  were already shining in the sky.       The grass under their feet was smooth and short, as if it had been mown  or shaven. The eaves of the Forest behind were clipped, and trim as a hedge.  The path was now plain before  them, well-tended and bordered with stone. It  wound  up on to the top  of a grassy knoll,  now grey under  the pale starry  night; and there,  still high  above them  on a further slope, they saw  the  twinkling lights of a house. Down again the path went, and then up aga in, up  a  long smooth  hillside of  turf, towards the light. Suddenly a wide yellow  beam  flowed out  brightly  from a  door  that  was  opened.  There  was Tom  Bombadil's  house  before them, up,  down,  under hill. Behind  it  a  steep  shoulder of the land  lay grey and bare,  and beyond that the dark shapes of   ####-the Barrow-downs stalked away into the eastern night.       They  all hurried  forward,  hobbits  and  ponies. Already  half  their  weariness  and all their fears  had fallen from them. Hey! Come  merry  dol!  rolled out the song to greet them.       Hey! Come derry dol! Hop along, my hearties!       Hobbits! Ponies all! We are fond of parties.       Now let the fun begin! Let us sing together!       Then  another clear voice, as young and as ancient as Spring, like  the  song of a glad water flowing  down  into  the night from a bright morning in  the hills, came falling like silver to meet them:       Now let the song begin! Let us sing together       Of sun, stars, moon and mist, rain and cloudy weather,       Light on the budding leaf, dew on the feather,       Wind on the open hill, bells on the heather,       Reeds by the shady pool, lilies on the water:       Old Tom Bombadil and the River-daughter!       And  with that song the hobbits stood upon  the threshold, and a golden  light was all about them.     ####-   Chapter 7. In the House of Tom Bombadil            The four hobbits stepped  over the  wide  stone  threshold,  and  stood  still,  blinking. They  were in a  long  low room,  filled with the light of  lamps swinging from the beams of the roof; and on the table of dark polished  wood stood many candles, tall and yellow, burning brightly.       In a  chair, at the far side of the room  facing  the outer door, sat a   woman. Her long yellow hair rippled down her shoulders;  her  gown was  green,  green as young reeds, shot  with silver like beads  of dew; and her belt was  of gold, shaped like a chain  of flag-lilies set with the pale-blue  eyes of  forget-me-nots.  About  her  feel  in  wide   vessels  of  green  and  brown  earthenware, white water -lilies  were  floating,  so that she  seemed  to be  enthroned in the midst of a pool.       'Enter, good guests!'  she said, and as she spoke they knew that it was  her  clear voice they had heard singing. They came a few timid steps further   into  the room,  and  began  to bow  low,  feeling  strangely surprised  and  awkward,  like folk that, knocking at a  cottage door to  beg for a drink of  water, have been answered  by a fair young elf-queen clad in living flowers.   But  before they could  say anything, she  sprang  lightly up  and  over the  lily-bowls,  and ran  laughing towards them; and as she ran her gown rustled  softly like the wind in the flowering borders of a river.       'Come dear  folk!' she said,  taking Frodo by the hand.  'Laugh  and be   merry! I am Goldberry, daughter of  the River.' Then lightly she passed them  and closing the door she turned her back to  it, with her  white arms spread  out  across  it. 'Let us  shut out the night!'  she said. 'For you are still  afraid, per haps, of mist and tree-shadows and deep water, and untame things.  Fear nothing! For tonight you are under the roof of Tom Bombadil.'       The hobbits looked at her in wonder; and she looked at each of them and   smiled. 'Fair lady  Goldberry!' said Frodo at last,  feeling his heart moved  with  a joy that he did not understand. He stood  as  he had at times  stood  enchanted by fair elven-voices; but the spell that was now laid upon him was  different:  less keen and lofty  was the  delight, but deeper and nearer  to  mortal heart; marvellous and yet not strange."
