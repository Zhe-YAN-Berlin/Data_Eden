The out-companies with a great cheer turned and smote their  pursuers.   Hunters  became the hunted. The retreat  became  an onslaught. The field was  strewn with stricken orcs and  men, and a  reek arose of torches cast  away,  sputtering ou t in swirling smoke. The cavalry rode on.       But  Denethor  did not  permit them to  go  far.  Though the enemy  was  checked, and for the moment driven back, great forces  were flowing  in from  the East.  Again  the  trumpet rang,  sounding the retreat.  The cavalry  of  Gondor halted. Behind their screen the out-companies re-formed. Now steadily  they  came marching  back. They  reached the  Gate  of the City and entered,   stepping  proudly:  and  proudly the people of the  City looked  on them and  cried their praise, and  yet they were troubled in heart. For the  companies  were grievously reduced. Faramir had lost a third of his men. And  where was  he?       Last of all he came. His men passed in. The  mounted knights  returned,  and at their rear  the banner  of Dol Amroth, and the Prince. And in his arms  before him on  his  horse  he bore  the body of his kinsman, Faramir  son of  Denethor, found upon the stricken field.       'Faramir! Faramir!' men cried, weeping in the  streets.  But he did not  answer, and they  bore him away up the winding  road to the Citadel  and his  father. Even  as the Nazgyl had swerved aside  from the  onset of  the White  Rider,  there came flying a deadly dart, and Faramir,  as he  held at bay  a   mounted champion of Harad, had  fallen to the earth.  Only the charge of Dol  Amroth had saved him from the red southland swords that would have hewed  him  as he lay.       The Prince Imrahil brought  Faramir to  the White Tower, and  he  said:  Your son has returned, lord, after  great deeds, and he told all that he had   ####-seen. But Denethor rose  and looked on the face  of his  son and was silent.  Then he  bade  them make a bed  in the  chamber and lay Faramir  upon it and  depart. But  he himself went up alone into the  secret room under the summit  of the Tower; and many who looked  up thither  at that time saw a pale light   that gleamed and  flickered from the  narrow  windows for a while,  and then  flashed and  went  out. And when Denethor descended again he went to  Faramir  and sat beside him withou t speaking, but the face of the Lord was grey, more  deathlike than his son's.        So now at last the  City was besieged, enclosed in a ring  of foes. The  Rammas  was broken, and all the Pelennor  abandoned  to the Enemy.  The last   word  to  come  from outside the  walls  was  brought by men flying down the  northward road ere the  Gate was  shut. They were the remnant of  the  guard  that was kept  at that point where the way from Anurien and  Rohan  ran into  the townlands: Ingold led them, the same who had admitted Gandalf and Pippin  less than five days before,  while the sun still rose and there was hope  in  the morning.       'There is no  news of the Rohirrim,' he said. 'Rohan will not come now.   Or if they come, it will not avail us. The new host that we had  tidings  of  has come first, from over  the River by way of Andros, it is said.  They are  strong: battalions of Orcs of the Eye, and  countless companies of Men of  a   new sort that  we have not met before. Not tall, but broad and grim, bearded  like dwarves, wielding great axes. Out of some savage land in the  wide East   they come, we  deem. They hold  the northward road; and  many have passed  on  into Anurien. The Rohirrim cannot come.'       The Gate was shut. All night watchmen on the  walls heard the rumour of  the enemy that roamed outside,  burning field  and tree, and  hewing any man  that they found abroad, living or  dead. The numbers that had already passed   over the River  could not be guessed  in the darkness, but when  morning, or   its  dim shadow,  stole over the plain, it was seen that  even fear by night  had  scarcely over -counted them.  The plain was  dark  with  their  marching  companies, and as far as eyes could strain in the  mirk there sprouted, like  a  foul fungus-growth, all about the beleaguered  city great camps of tents,  black or sombre red.       Busy as ants hurrying orcs were digging, digging lines of deep trenches  in a huge ring, just out of bowshot from the walls; and as the trenches were   ####-made each was filled with fire, though how it was  kindled or fed, by art or   devilry, none could see.  All day the labour  went forward, while the men of  Minas Tirith  looked  on, unable to hinder it. And as each  length of trench  was  completed,  they  could see great wains approaching; and soon yet  more  companies of the enemy were swiftly setting up, each behind  the cover of  a   trench, great engines for the casting of missiles. There were  none upon the  City walls large enough to reach so far or to stay the work."
