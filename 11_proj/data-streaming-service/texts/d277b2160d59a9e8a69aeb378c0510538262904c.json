The slow, endless clanging filled their room, as mournful as a dirge. Had some enemy stormed the castle and murdered King Robert? Was that the meaning of the fighting they had heard?  She went to sleep wondering, restless, and fearful. Was her beautiful Joffrey the king now? Or had they killed him too? She was afraid for him, and for her father. If only they would tell her what was happening…  That night Sansa dreamt of Joffrey on the throne, with herself seated beside him in a gown of woven gold. She had a crown on her head, and everyone she had ever known came before her, to bend the knee and say their courtesies.  The next morning, the morning of the third day, Ser Boros Blount of the Kingsguard came to escort her to the queen.  Ser Boros was an ugly man with a broad chest and short, bandy legs. His nose was flat, his cheeks baggy with jowls, his hair grey and brittle. Today he wore white velvet, and his snowy cloak was fastened with a lion brooch. The beast had the soft sheen of gold, and his eyes were tiny rubies.  You look very handsome and splendid this morning, Ser Boros,  Sansa told him. A lady remembered her courtesies, and she was resolved to be a lady no matter what.   And you, my lady,  Ser Boros said in a flat voice.  Her Grace awaits. Come with me.   There were guards outside her door, Lannister men-at-arms in crimson cloaks and lion-crested helms. Sansa made herself smile at them pleasantly and bid them a good morning as she passed. It was the first time she had been allowed outside the chamber since Ser Arys Oakheart had led her there two mornings past.  To keep you safe, my sweet one,  Queen Cersei had told her.  Joffrey would never forgive me if anything happened to his precious.   Sansa had expected that Ser Boros would escort her to the royal apartments, but instead he led her out of Maegor’s Holdfast. The bridge was down again. Some workmen were lowering a man on ropes into the depths of the dry moat. When Sansa peered down, she saw a body impaled on the huge iron spikes below. She averted her eyes quickly, afraid to ask, afraid to look too long, afraid he might be someone she knew.  They found Queen Cersei in the council chambers, seated at the head of a long table littered with papers, candles, and blocks of sealing wax. The room was as splendid as any that Sansa had ever seen. She stared in awe at the carved wooden screen and the twin sphinxes that sat beside the door.   Your Grace,  Ser Boros said when they were ushered inside by another of the Kingsguard, Ser Mandon of the curiously dead face,  I’ve brought the girl.   Sansa had hoped Joffrey might be with her. Her prince was not there, but three of the king’s councillors were. Lord Petyr Baelish sat on the queen’s left hand, Grand Maester Pycelle at the end of the table, while Lord Varys hovered over them, smelling flowery. All of them were clad in black, she realized with a feeling of dread. Mourning clothes…  The queen wore a high-collared black silk gown, with a hundred dark red rubies sewn into her bodice, covering her from neck to bosom. They were cut in the shape of teardrops, as if the queen were weeping blood. Cersei smiled to see her, and Sansa thought it was the sweetest and saddest smile she had ever seen.  Sansa, my sweet child,  she said,  I know you’ve been asking for me. I’m sorry that I could not send for you sooner. Matters have been very unsettled, and I have not had a moment. I trust my people have been taking good care of you?    Everyone has been very sweet and pleasant, Your Grace, thank you ever so much for asking,  Sansa said politely.  Only, well, no one will talk to us or tell us what’s happened…    Us?  Cersei seemed puzzled.   We put the steward’s girl in with her,  Ser Boros said.  We did not know what else to do with her.   The queen frowned.  Next time, you will ask,  she said, her voice sharp.  The gods only know what sort of tales she’s been filling Sansa’s head with.    Jeyne’s scared,  Sansa said.  She won’t stop crying. I promised her I’d ask if she could see her father.   Old Grand Maester Pycelle lowered his eyes.   Her father is well, isn’t he?  Sansa said anxiously. She knew there had been fighting, but surely no one would harm a steward. Vayon Poole did not even wear a sword.  Queen Cersei looked at each of the councillors in turn.  I won’t have Sansa fretting needlessly. What shall we do with this little friend of hers, my lords?   Lord Petyr leaned forward.  I’ll find a place for her.    Not in the city,  said the queen.   Do you take me for a fool?   The queen ignored that.  Ser Boros, escort this girl to Lord Petyr’s apartments and instruct his people to keep her there until he comes for her. Tell her that Littlefinger will be taking her to see her father, that ought to calm her down. I want her gone before Sansa returns to her chamber."
