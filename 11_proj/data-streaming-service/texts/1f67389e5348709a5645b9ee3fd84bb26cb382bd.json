His punishment was grievous, but he has learned from his mistake.   Were my sons no more than a lesson for a king, then? Davos felt his mouth tighten.   It is night in your Seven Kingdoms now,  the red woman went on,  but soon the sun will rise again. The war continues, Davos Seaworth, and some will soon learn that even an ember in the ashes can still ignite a great blaze. The old maester looked at Stannis and saw only a man. You see a king. You are both wrong. He is the Lord’s chosen, the warrior of fire. I have seen him leading the fight against the dark, I have seen it in the flames. The flames do not lie, else you would not be here. It is written in prophecy as well. When the red star bleeds and the darkness gathers, Azor Ahai shall be born again amidst smoke and salt to wake dragons out of stone. The bleeding star has come and gone, and Dragonstone is the place of smoke and salt. Stannis Baratheon is Azor Ahai reborn!  Her red eyes blazed like twin fires, and seemed to stare deep into his soul.  You do not believe me. You doubt the truth of R’hllor even now… yet have served him all the same, and will serve him again. I shall leave you here to think on all that I have told you. And because R’hllor is the source of all good, I shall leave the torch as well.   With a smile and swirl of scarlet skirts, she was gone. Only her scent lingered after. That, and the torch. Davos lowered himself to the floor of the cell and wrapped his arms about his knees. The shifting torchlight washed over him. Once Melisandre’s footsteps faded away, the only sound was the scrabbling of rats. Ice and fire, he thought. Black and white. Dark and light. Davos could not deny the power of her god. He had seen the shadow crawling from Melisandre’s womb, and the priestess knew things she had no way of knowing. She saw my purpose in her flames. It was good to learn that Salla had not sold him, but the thought of the red woman spying out his secrets with her fires disquieted him more than he could say. And what did she mean when she said that I had served her god and would serve him again? He did not like that either.  He lifted his eyes to stare up at the torch. He looked for a long time, never blinking, watching the flames shift and shimmer. He tried to see beyond them, to peer through the fiery curtain and glimpse whatever lived back there… but there was nothing, only fire, and after a time his eyes began to water.  God-blind and tired, Davos curled up on the straw and gave himself to sleep.  Three days later—well, Porridge had come thrice, and Lamprey twice—Davos heard voices outside his cell. He sat up at once, his back to the stone wall, listening to the sounds of struggle. This was new, a change in his unchanging world. The noise was coming from the left, where the steps led up to daylight. He could hear a man’s voice, pleading and shouting.   …Madness!  the man was saying as he came into view, dragged along between two guardsmen with fiery hearts on their breasts. Porridge went before them, jangling a ring of keys, and Ser Axell Florent walked behind.  Axell,  the prisoner said desperately,  for the love you bear me, unhand me! You cannot do this, I’m no traitor.  He was an older man, tall and slender, with silvery grey hair, a pointed beard, and a long elegant face twisted in fear.  Where is Selyse, where is the queen? I demand to see her. The Others take you all! Release me!   The guards paid no mind to his outcries.  Here?  Porridge asked in front of the cell. Davos got to his feet. For an instant he considered trying to rush them when the door was opened, but that was madness. There were too many, the guards wore swords, and Porridge was strong as a bull.  Ser Axell gave the gaoler a curt nod.  Let the traitors enjoy each other’s company.    I am no traitor!  screeched the prisoner as Porridge was unlocking the door. Though he was plainly dressed, in grey wool doublet and black breeches, his speech marked him as highborn. His birth will not serve him here, thought Davos.  Porridge swung the bars wide, Ser Axell gave a nod, and the guards flung their charge in headlong. The man stumbled and might have fallen, but Davos caught him. At once he wrenched away and staggered back toward the door, only to have it slammed in his pale, pampered face.  No,  he shouted.  Nooooo.  All the strength suddenly left his legs, and he slid slowly to the floor, clutching at the iron bars. Ser Axell, Porridge, and the guards had already turned to leave.  You cannot do this,  the prisoner shouted at their retreating backs.  I am the King’s Hand!   It was then that Davos knew him.  You are Alester Florent.   The man turned his head.  Who…?    Ser Davos Seaworth.   Lord Alester blinked.  Seaworth… the onion knight. You tried to murder Melisandre.   Davos did not deny it.  At Storm’s End you wore red-gold armor, with inlaid lapis flowers on your breastplate."
