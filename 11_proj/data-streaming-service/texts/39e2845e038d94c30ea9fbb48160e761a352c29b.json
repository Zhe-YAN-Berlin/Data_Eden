King Robert is dead, and Mother and I are summoned to the Red Keep to swear fealty to Joffrey. She says we must be loyal, and when she marries Joffrey she will plead with him to spare our lord father’s life.  His fingers closed into a fist, crushing Sansa’s letter between them.  And she says nothing of Arya, nothing, not so much as a word. Damn her! What’s wrong with the girl?   Bran felt all cold inside.  She lost her wolf,  he said, weakly, remembering the day when four of his father’s guardsmen had returned from the south with Lady’s bones. Summer and Grey Wind and Shaggydog had begun to howl before they crossed the drawbridge, in voices drawn and desolate. Beneath the shadow of the First Keep was an ancient lichyard, its headstones spotted with pale lichen, where the old Kings of Winter had laid their faithful servants. It was there they buried Lady, while her brothers stalked between the graves like restless shadows. She had gone south, and only her bones had returned.  Their grandfather, old Lord Rickard, had gone as well, with his son Brandon who was Father’s brother, and two hundred of his best men. None had ever returned. And Father had gone south, with Arya and Sansa, and Jory and Hullen and Fat Tom and the rest, and later Mother and Ser Rodrik had gone, and they hadn’t come back either. And now Robb meant to go. Not to King’s Landing and not to swear fealty, but to Riverrun, with a sword in his hand. And if their lord father were truly a prisoner, that could mean his death for a certainty. It frightened Bran more than he could say.   If Robb has to go, watch over him,  Bran entreated the old gods, as they watched him with the heart tree’s red eyes,  and watch over his men, Hal and Quent and the rest, and Lord Umber and Lady Mormont and the other lords. And Theon too, I suppose. Watch them and keep them safe, if it please you, gods. Help them defeat the Lannisters and save Father and bring them home.   A faint wind sighed through the godswood and the red leaves stirred and whispered. Summer bared his teeth.  You hear them, boy?  a voice asked.  Bran lifted his head. Osha stood across the pool, beneath an ancient oak, her face shadowed by leaves. Even in irons, the wildling moved quiet as a cat. Summer circled the pool, sniffed at her. The tall woman flinched.   Summer, to me,  Bran called. The direwolf took one final sniff, spun, and bounded back. Bran wrapped his arms around him.  What are you doing here?  He had not seen Osha since they’d taken her captive in the wolfswood, though he knew she’d been set to working in the kitchens.   They are my gods too,  Osha said.  Beyond the Wall, they are the only gods.  Her hair was growing out, brown and shaggy. It made her look more womanly, that and the simple dress of brown roughspun they’d given her when they took her mail and leather.  Gage lets me have my prayers from time to time, when I feel the need, and I let him do as he likes under my skirt, when he feels the need. It’s nothing to me. I like the smell of flour on his hands, and he’s gentler than Stiv.  She gave an awkward bow.  I’ll leave you. There’s pots that want scouring.    No, stay,  Bran commanded her.  Tell me what you meant, about hearing the gods.   Osha studied him.  You asked them and they’re answering. Open your ears, listen, you’ll hear.   Bran listened.  It’s only the wind,  he said after a moment, uncertain.  The leaves are rustling.    Who do you think sends the wind, if not the gods?  She seated herself across the pool from him, clinking faintly as she moved. Mikken had fixed iron manacles to her ankles, with a heavy chain between them; she could walk, so long as she kept her strides small, but there was no way for her to run, or climb, or mount a horse.  They see you, boy. They hear you talking. That rustling, that’s them talking back.    What are they saying?    They’re sad. Your lord brother will get no help from them, not where he’s going. The old gods have no power in the south. The weirwoods there were all cut down, thousands of years ago. How can they watch your brother when they have no eyes?   Bran had not thought of that. It frightened him. If even the gods could not help his brother, what hope was there? Maybe Osha wasn’t hearing them right. He cocked his head and tried to listen again. He thought he could hear the sadness now, but nothing more than that.  The rustling grew louder. Bran heard muffled footfalls and a low humming, and Hodor came blundering out of the trees, naked and smiling.  Hodor!    He must have heard our voices,  Bran said.  Hodor, you forgot your clothes.    Hodor,  Hodor agreed. He was dripping wet from the neck down, steaming in the chill air. His body was covered with brown hair, thick as a pelt. Between his legs, his manhood swung long and heavy.  Osha eyed him with a sour smile.  Now there’s a big man,  she said."
