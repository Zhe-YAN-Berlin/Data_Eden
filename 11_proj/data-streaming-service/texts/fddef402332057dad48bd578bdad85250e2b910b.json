Are they Men he has ruined, or has he blended the races of  Orcs and Men? That would be a black evil!'       Treebeard  rumbled for a moment, as if he  were pronouncing some  deep,  subterranean Entish malediction. 'Some  time ago I began to wonder  how Orcs  dared to pass  through my woods so  freely,'  he went on. 'Only lately did I  guess that  Saruman was to blame, and that  long ago he had been spying  out  all the ways, and discovering  my secrets. He and his  foul folk are  making  havoc now. Down on the borders  they are  felling  trees-good trees. Some of  the trees they just cut down and leave to rot -- orc-mischief that; but most    ####-are hewn up and  carried off to feed  the fires of Orthanc. There is always a   smoke rising from Isengard these days.        'Curse  him, root and branch!  Many  of those  trees  were  my  friends  creatures I had known from nut and acorn; many had voices of their  own that  are lost for ever now. And there are wastes of stump  and bramble where once  there were singing groves. I have been idle. I have let things slip. It must  stop!'       Treebeard raised  himself  from  his  bed  with a jerk,  stood  up, and  thumped his hand on the table. The vessels of light trembled and sent up two   jets  of  flame.  There  was a flicker like green fire in his  eyes, and his  beard stood out stiff as a great besom.       'I will  stop it!' he boomed. 'And  you shall come  with me. You may be  able  to help me. You will be helping your own friends that way, too; for if  Saruman is not checked Rohan and Gondor will have an enemy behind as well  as  in front. Our roads go together -- to Isengard!'       'We will come with you,' said Merry. 'We will do wha t we can.'       'Yes!' said  Pippin. 'I should like to see the White Hand overthrown. I  should like  to be there, even if I could not  be of much use: I shall never   forget UglÂ®k and the crossing of Rohan.'       'Good! Good!'  said  Treebeard. 'But I spoke   hastily. We must  not  be  hasty. I have become too hot. I must cool myself and think; fur it is easier  to shout stop! than to do it.'       He strode to the archway and stood for some time under the falling rain  of the spring. Then he laughed and shook himself, and wherever the  drops of  water fell glittering from him to the ground they glinted like red and green  sparks. He came back and laid himself on the bed again and was silent.       After some time the hobbits heard him murmuring  again. He seemed to be  counting  on his fingers. 'Fangorn,  Finglas, Fladrif, aye, aye,' he sighed.  'The trouble is  that there are so  few of us left,' he said turning towards  the hobbits. 'Only  three remain of the first Ents that walked in the  woods  before  the  Darkness: only myself, Fangorn, and  Finglas  and Fladrif  -- to  give them their Elvish names; you may call them Leaflock and Skinbark if you   like that better. And of us three Leaflock and Skinbark are not much use for   this business. Leaflock has grown sleepy. almost  tree-ish, you might say: he  has taken to standing by himself half-asleep all through the summer with the  deep grass of the meadows round his knees. Covered with leafy hair he is. He   ####-used to rouse up in winter; but of late he has been  too drowsy to walk   far  even then.  Skinbark  lived on the mountain-slopes west of Isengard. That is  where the worst  trouble  has been. He was wounded by the Orcs,  and many of  his folk and his tree-herds have been murdered and destroyed. He has gone up  into the high places, among the birches that he loves  best, and he will not  come down. Still,  I  daresay I  could get  together a fair company  of  our  younger folks-if  I could make  them understand the  need: if I could  rouse  them: we are not a hasty folk. What a pity the re are so few of us!'       'Why are there so few  when  you  have  lived in this country so long?'  asked Pippin. 'Have a great many died?'       'Oh, no!' said Treebeard. 'None  have died from  inside, as  you  might  say. Some have  fallen in the evil chances of the long years, of course: and  more have  grown tree-ish. But  there were never many of us and we have  not  increased. There have been no Entings  -- no children, you would say, not for   a terrible long count of years. You see, we lost the Entwives.'       'How very sad!' said Pippin. 'How was it that they all died?'       'They did not die!' said Treebeard. 'I never said died. We lost them, I  said. We lost them and we cannot find them.' He sighed. 'I thought most folk   knew that. There were songs about the hunt of the Ents for the Entwives sung  among  Elves  and  Men  from  Mirkwood  to  Gondor.  They  cannot  be  quite  forgotten.'       'Well, I  am  afraid the songs have not come west over the Mountains to  the Shire,'  said Merry."
