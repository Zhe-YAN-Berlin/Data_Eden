'Tell  me,  lord,' he said,  'what  brings you  here?  And what was the  meaning  of the dark  words?  Long  has  Boromir  son of Denethor  been gone  seeking an answer, and the  horse that we lent him  came back riderless. What  doom do you bring out of the North?'       'The doom of choice,' said Aragorn. 'You may say this to Thjoden son of  Thengel: open war lies before him, with Sauron or against him. None may live  now as they ha ve lived, and few  shall keep what they call their own. But of  these  great  matters we  will speak  later. If  chance allows, I will  come  myself to the king. Now I am in great need, and I ask for help,  or at least   for tidings. You heard that we are pursuing an orc-host that carried off our  friends. What can you tell us?'       'That  you  need not  pursue  them further,' said Jomer. 'The  Orcs are  destroyed.'       'And our friends?'       'We found none but Orcs.'       'But that is strange indeed,' said Aragorn. 'Did you search the  slain?   Were there no bodies other than those of orc-kind? They would be small. Only  children to your eyes, unshod but clad in grey.'       'There  were no dwarves  nor children,' said Jomer. 'We counted all the  slain and despoiled them, and then we piled the carcases and burned them, as  is our custom. The ashes are smoking still.'       'We do not speak of dwarves or children,' said Gimli. 'Our friends were  hobbits.'       'Hobbits?' said Jomer. 'And what may they be? It is a strange name.'       'A strange name  for a strange folk,' said Gimli. 'But these were  very  dear to us. It seems that you have heard in Rohan of the words that troubled   Minas Tirith. They spoke of the Halfling. These hobbits are Halflings.'       'Halflings!' laughed the Rider that stood beside Jomer. 'Halflings! But  they are  only  a little people in old songs and children's tales out of the  North. Do we walk in legends or on the green earth in the daylight?'   ####-     'A man may do both,' said Aragorn. 'For not we bu t those who come after   will make the  legends  of  our time. The green earth, say you?  That  is  a   mighty matter of legend, though you tread it under the light of day!'       'Time is  pressing,'  said the  Rider, not  heeding  Aragorn. 'We  must   hasten south, lord. Let us leave these wild folk to their fancies. Or let us  bind them and take them to the king.'       'Peace, Jothain!' said Jomer in his own tongue. 'Leave me a while. Tell  the jored to assemble on the path' and make ready to ride to the Entwade. '       Muttering Jothain retired, and spoke to  the others. Soon they drew off  and left Jomer alone with the three companions.       'All  that you say  is strange,  Aragorn.' he said. 'Yet you speak  the  truth, that is plain: the Men of the Mark do not lie, and therefore they are  not easily deceived. But you have not told  all. Will you not now speak more  fully of your errand, so that I may judge what to do?'       'I set out from Imladris, as it is named in the rhyme, many weeks ago,'  answered Aragorn.  'With me went Boromir of Minas Tirith. My errand was to  go  to that city with the son of Denethor,  to aid his folk in their war against  Sauron. But the Company that I journeyed with had other  business. Of that I  cannot speak now. Gandalf the Grey was our leader.'       'Gandalf!' Jomer exclaimed. 'Gandalf Greyhame is known in the Mark: but  his name, I warn  you, is no longer a password to the king's favour.  He has  been a guest in the land many times in the memory of men, coming as he will,  after  a season,  or  after  many  years. He is  ever the  herald of strange  events: a bringer of evil, some now say.       'Indeed since his last coming in the summer all things have gone amiss.   At that  time our trouble with Saruman began. Until then we counted  Saruman  our  friend,  hut Gandalf  came  then  and  warned us that  sudden  war  was  preparing  in  Isengard.  He  said that  he himself had  been  a prisoner in  Orthanc and had hardly escaped, and  he  begged  for help. But Thjoden would  not listen to him, and he went away. Speak not the name of Gandalf loudly in  Thjoden's ears! He is  wroth.  For  Gandalf took  the  horse  that is called  Shadowfax, the most precious of all the king's steeds, chief  of the Mearas,  which only the Lord of the Mark may ride. For the sire of their race was the  great horse of Eorl that knew the speech of Men. Seven  nights ago Shadowfax  returned; but  the king's  anger is not less, for  now the horse is wild and  will let no man handle him.'   ####-     'Then  Shadowfax  has found  his  way alone from  the far North,'  said  Aragorn; 'for  it  was there that he and Gandalf  parted. But  alas! Gandalf  will  ride no longer. He fell into darkness in the Mines  of Moria and comes  not again.'       'That  is heavy  tidings,'  said Jomer."
