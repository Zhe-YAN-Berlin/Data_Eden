I do not doubt there is some   ####-shadow of the Great Darkness  lying there still away north; and bad memories  are handed down. But there are hollow dales in this land where the  Darkness  has never been lifted, and the trees are older  than I am. Still, we do what  we can. We keep off strangers and the  foolhardy; and we train and we teach,  we walk and we weed.       'We are tree-herds, we old  Ents. Few  enough of us are left now. Sheep  get  like shepherd, and shepherds like  sheep, it is said;  but  slowly, and  neither have  long in the world. It  is quicker and  closer with  trees  and  Ents, and they walk down the  ages  together. For Ents are more like  Elves:   less interested  in   themselves than Men are,  and  better at getting inside  other things.  And yet again  Ents are more like Men,  more  changeable than  Elves are, and  quicker at taking the colour of the outside,  you might say.   Or  better than both:  for they are steadier a nd keep their  minds on things  longer. 'Some of my kin look just  like trees now, and need something  great  to  rouse them; and they speak  only in whispers. But  some  of my trees are  limb-lithe, and many can talk to me. Elves began it, of course, waking trees  up  and  teaching  them to speak and  learning their  tree-talk. They always  wished to talk to everything, the old Elves did. But then the Great Darkness  came, and they passed away  over the Sea, or fled into far  valleys, and hid  themselves,  and made  songs  about days that would never come again.  Never  again. Aye,  aye, there was all  one wood once upon a time: from here to the  Mountains of Lune, and this was just the East End.       'Those were the broad days! Time was when I could walk and sing a ll day  and  hear no more  than  the echo of my own  voice in the hollow hills.  The  woods were like the woods of Lothlurien. only thicker stronger, younger. And  the smell of the air! I used to spend a week just breathing.'       Treebeard  fell silent, striding along, and yet  making  hardly a sound  with his great feet. Then he began to hum again, and passed into a murmuring  chant. Gradually the hobbits became aware that he was chanting to them:       In the willow-meads of Tasarinan I walked in the Spring.       Ah! the sight and the smell of the Spring in Nan-tasarion!       And I said that was good.       I wandered in Summer in the elm-woods of Ossiriand.       Ah! the light and the music in the Summer by the Seven Rivers of Ossir!       And I thought that was best.       To the beeches of Neldoreth I came in the Autumn.       Ah!  the  gold and the red  and the sighing of leaves  in the Autumn in    ####-Taur-na-neldor!       It was more than my desire.       To the pine-trees upon the  highland of  Dorthonion  I climbed  in  the  Winter.       Ah! the wind and the whiteness and the black  branches  of  Winter upon  Orod-na-Thfn!       My voice went up and sang in the sky.       And now all those lands lie under the wave.       And I walk in Ambaruna, in Tauremorna, in Aldaluml.       In my own land, in the country of Fangorn,       Where the roots are long,       And the years lie thicker than the leaves       In Tauremornaluml.       He  ended, and strode on silently, and in all  the wood, as far  as ear  could reach, there was not a sound.       The day  waned,  and dusk was twined about  the boles of  the trees. At   last  the hobbits saw, rising dimly before them, a steep dark land: they had  come to the feet of the mountains, and to the green roots of tall Methedras.   Down the hillside  the young Entwash,  leaping  from its springs  high above,   ran noisily from step to step to meet them. On the right of the stream there  was  a long slope, clad with grass, now  grey in the twilight. No trees grew  there  and  it  was  open  to  the sky;  stars were shining already in lakes  between shores of cloud.        Treebeard  strode  up the slope,  hardly  slackening his pace. Suddenly  before them the hobbits saw a wide opening. Two great trees stood there, one  on  either side, like living gate-posts; bu t  there was  no gate  save their  crossing and interwoven boughs. As  the old Ent approached, the trees lifted  up their branches, and all  their leaves quivered and rustled. For they were  evergreen trees, and their leaves were dark and polished, and gleamed in the  twilight. Beyond them was a wide level space, as though the floor of a great  hall had been cut  in the side of the hill. On either hand the  walls sloped  upwards, until they were fifty feet high  or more, and along each wall stood  an aisle of trees that also increased in height as they marched inwards.        At the far end the rock -wall was sheer,  but at  the bottom it had been  hollowed back into a  shallow bay with an arched roof: the only roof of  the  hall, save the branches  of  the trees, which  at the inner end overshadowed  all the ground leaving only a broad open path in the middle."
