'Yes, he warned me of that in his last letter,' said Frodo,  'so I have  always kept it on its chain.'       'Very wise,'  said Gandalf.  'But  as for  his long life,   Bilbo  never   connected  it  with the  ring  at all. He took  all  the credit  for that to  himself,  and he was very  proud of  it. Though  he was getting restless and  uneasy.  Thin and  stretched  he  said. A  sign  that  the  ring was getting  control.'       'How long have you known all this?' asked Frodo again.       'Known?'  said  Gandalf.  'I  have known  much that only the Wise know,   Frodo. But  if you mean \"known about this ring\", well,  I still do not know,   one might say. There is a last test to make. But I no longer doubt my guess.        'When did I first begin to guess?' he mused, searching back  in memory.  'Let me see - it was in the year that the White Council drove the dark power   from Mirkwood,  just before the Battle of Five  Armies, that Bilbo found his  ring.  A  shadow  fell on my  heart then, though  I did not know  yet what I  feared. I wondered often how Gollum came  by a Great Ring, as plainly it was  - that at least was clear from the first. Then I heard Bilbo's strange story  of how he had \"won\" it, and I  could not believe it. When I at last  got the  truth out of him,  I saw at once that he had been trying to put his claim to  the  ring beyond  doubt. Much like Gollum  with his \"birthday  present\". The  lies were too much alike for my comfort.  Clearly the ring had an unwholesome  power  that  set to  work on  its keeper at once.  That was the  first  real  warning I had that all was not well. I told Bilbo often that such rings were  better left unused; but he resented it, and soon got angry. There was little  else that I could  do.  I could not take it  from him without doing  greater   harm; and  I had no right to  do so anyway. I could only watch  and wait.  I  might perhaps have consulted Saruman the White, but something always held  me  back.'       'Who is he?' asked Frodo. I have never heard of him before.'       'Maybe  not,' answered Gandalf. 'Hobbits  are, or were,  no concern  of  his. Yet he is great among the Wise.  He  is the  chief of  my order and the   ####-head of the Council. His knowledge is deep, but his pride has grown with it,   and he takes ill any meddling. The lore of the Elven-rings, great and small,  is  his province. He  has long studied it, seeking the lost secrets of their  making; but when the  Rings  were debated  in the Council, all that he would   reveal to us of his ring-lore told against my fears. So my doubt slept  - but  uneasily. Still I watched and I waited.       'And all  seemed well  with  Bilbo. And  the  years  passed. Yes,  they  passed, and  they seemed  not to touch him.  He showed no signs of age.  The  shadow fell  on me  again. But I said  to  myself: \"After all he comes of  a   long-lived family on his mother's side. There is time yet. Wait!\"       'And  I waited.  Until  that night when he left this house. He said and  did things then that  filled me with a  fear that no words  of Saruman could  allay. I knew at last that something dark and deadly was at work. And I have   spent most of the years since then in finding out the truth of it.'       'There  wasn't  any  permanent  harm  done,  was  there?'  asked  Frodo  anxiously. 'He would  get all right in time, wouldn't he? Be able to rest in  peace, I mean?'       'He felt better at once,' said Gandalf. 'But there is only one Power in  this world that knows all about the Rings and their effects; and as far as I  know there is no Power  in the world that knows all about hobbits. Among the  Wise I  am  the only one that goes in for hobbit-lore: an obscure branch  of  knowledge, but  full  of surprises.  Soft as  butter  they  can be,  and yet  sometimes as tough as old  tree-roots.  I  think it likely  that  some would   resist the  Rings far longer  than most of the Wise  would believe.  I don't  think you need worry about Bilbo.       'Of  course, he possessed the ring  for many years,  and used it,  so it  might take a long while for the  influence to  wear off  - before it was safe  for him to see it  again, for  instance.  Otherwise,  he might  live on  for   years,  quite happily: just stop  as  he was when he parted with  it. For he  gave it up in the end of his own accord: an important point. No, I  was  not  troubled about dear Bilbo any more, once he had let the  thing go. It is for   you that I feel responsible.       'Ever  since  Bilbo left  I have been deeply concerned  about you,  and  about all  these charming, absurd, helpless  hobbits. It would be a grievous  blow to the world, if  the Dark Power overcame the Shire; if all  your kind,  jolly, stupid Bolgers, Hornblowers, Boffins, Bracegirdles, and the rest, not  to mention the ridiculous Bagginses, became enslaved."
