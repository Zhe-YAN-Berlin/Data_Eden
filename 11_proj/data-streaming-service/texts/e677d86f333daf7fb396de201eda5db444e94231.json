Indeed  you know  little of Orcs, if  you go hunting  them  in this  fashion.  They were swift and well-armed, and they were many.  You would have changed from hunters to prey, if ever you had overtaken them.  But there is something strange about you, Strider.' He bent his clear bright  eyes again upon the Ranger. 'That  is  no name for a Man that  you give. And  strange too is your raiment.  Have you sprung out of the  grass? How did you  escape our sight? Are you elvish folk?'       'No,'  said  Aragorn.  'One  only of us  is an  Elf, Legolas  from  the  Woodland Realm in  distant Mirkwood. But we have  passed through  Lothlurien,  and the gifts and favour of the Lady go with us.'       The Rider looked at them  with  renewed wonder, but  his eyes hardened.  'Then there  is a Lady in the Golden Wood, as old tales tell!' he said. 'Few  escape  her  nets, they  say. These are  strange days! But if  you  have her   favour, then you  also are  net -weavers and  sorcerers,  maybe.' He turned a   cold glance suddenly upon Legolas and Gimli.  'Why do you  not speak, silent  ones?' he demanded.       Gimli  rose and  planted  his feet  firmly apart: his hand gripped  the  handle  of  his  axe,  and  his  dark  eyes flashed.  'Give  me  your  name,  horse-master, and I will give you mine, and more besides,' he said.       'As for that,' said the Rider, staring down at the Dwarf, 'the stranger   should declare  himself first. Yet I am named  Jomer  son of Jomund,  and am  called the Third Marshal of Riddermark.'       'Then Jomer son  of Jomund,  Third Marshal of Riddermark, let Gimli the  Dwarf  Gluin's son warn you against foolish  words.  You speak evil of  that  which is fair  beyond the  reach  of your  thought, and only little  wit can  excuse you.'       Jomer's eyes  blazed, and the Men of Rohan murmured angrily, and closed  in, advancing  their  spears. 'I  would cut  off your  head, beard and  all,  Master Dwarf, if it stood but a little higher from the ground ' said Jomer.       'He stands not  alone,'  said Legolas,  bending his bow and fitting  an  arrow with hands that moved quicker than sight. 'You would  die before  your  stroke fell.'   ####-     Jomer  raised  his sword, and things might  have  gone ill, but Aragorn  sprang  between them, and raised his hand. 'Your pardon,  Jomer!' he  cried.   'When you know more you will understand why  you have angered my  companions.   We intend no  evil to Rohan,  nor to any of its folk, neither to man  nor to  horse. Will you not hear our tale before you strike?'       'I  will,'  said  Jomer  lowering  his  blade. 'Bu t  wanderers  in  the  Riddermark  would be  wise to be less haughty in these days of doubt.  First   tell me your right name.'       'First tell me whom you serve,' said Aragorn. 'Are you friend or foe of  Sauron, the Dark Lord of Mordor?'       'I serve only the Lord  of the  Mark, Thjoden  King  son  of  Thengel,'  answered Jomer. 'We do  not serve the Power of the Black Land far away,  but  neither are we yet at open war with him; and  if you  are fleeing  from him,  then you had best leave this  land. There is  trouble now on all our borders,   and we are threatened; but we desire only to be free, and to live as we have  lived, keeping  our  own, and  serving  no  foreign  lord,  good or evil. We  welcomed guests kindly in the better days, but in  these  times the unbidden  stranger finds us swift and hard. Come! Who are you?  Whom do you serve?   At  whose command do you hunt Orcs in our land?'       'I serve no man,' said  Aragorn;  'but the servants of  Sauron I pursue  into whatever land they may go. There are few among mortal Men who know  more  of Orcs; and I do not hunt them in this fashion out of choice. The Orcs whom  we pursued  took captive two of my friends. In such need a man  that  has no   horse  will go on foot, and he will  not ask for leave to  follow the trail.  Nor will  he  count  the heads  of  the enemy save  with a  sword.  I am not  weaponless.'       Aragorn  threw back his cloak. The elven-sheath glittered as he grasped  it, and the bright blade of And®ril shone like a sudden flame as he swept it  out.   'Elendil!'  he cried. 'I  am  Aragorn son  of Arathorn and  am  called  Elessar, the Elfstone, D®nadan, the heir of Isildur Elendil's son of Gondor.  Here is the Sword  that was  Broken and is forged again! Will you aid  me or  thwart me? Choose swiftly!'       Gimli  and Legolas looked at their companion in amazement, for they had  not seen him  in this  mood before. He seemed to have grown in stature while   ####-Jomer had shrunk; and in his  living face they caught a brief vision of  the   power and majesty of the  kings  of stone. For a moment it seemed to the eyes  of Legolas  that a white flame  flickered  on the  brows  of Aragorn  like a   shining crown.       Jomer stepped back and a look of awe was in his face."
