Yes,  Jon said,  but their own sort of honor, sire.    In Mance Rayder?    Yes. I think so.    In the Lord of Bones?   Jon hesitated.  Rattleshirt, we called him. Treacherous and bloodthirsty. If there’s honor in him, he hides it down beneath his suit of bones.    And this other man, this Tormund of the many names who eluded us after the battle? Answer me truly.    Tormund Giantsbane seemed to me the sort of man who would make a good friend and a bad enemy, Your Grace.   Stannis gave a curt nod.  Your father was a man of honor. He was no friend to me, but I saw his worth. Your brother was a rebel and a traitor who meant to steal half my kingdom, but no man can question his courage. What of you?   Does he want me to say I love him? Jon’s voice was stiff and formal as he said,  I am a man of the Night’s Watch.    Words. Words are wind. Why do you think I abandoned Dragonstone and sailed to the Wall, Lord Snow?    I am no lord, sire. You came because we sent for you, I hope. Though I could not say why you took so long about it.   Surprisingly, Stannis smiled at that.  You’re bold enough to be a Stark. Yes, I should have come sooner. If not for my Hand, I might not have come at all. Lord Seaworth is a man of humble birth, but he reminded me of my duty, when all I could think of was my rights. I had the cart before the horse, Davos said. I was trying to win the throne to save the kingdom, when I should have been trying to save the kingdom to win the throne.  Stannis pointed north.  There is where I’ll find the foe that I was born to fight.    His name may not be spoken,  Melisandre added softly.  He is the God of Night and Terror, Jon Snow, and these shapes in the snow are his creatures.    They tell me that you slew one of these walking corpses to save Lord Mormont’s life,  Stannis said.  it may be that this is your war as well, Lord Snow. If you will give me your help.    My sword is pledged to the Night’s Watch, Your Grace,  Jon Snow answered carefully.  That did not please the king. Stannis ground his teeth and said,  I need more than a sword from you.   Jon was lost.  My lord?    I need the north.   The north.  I… my brother Robb was King in the North…    Your brother was the rightful Lord of Winterfell. If he had stayed home and done his duty, instead of crowning himself and riding off to conquer the riverlands, he might be alive today. Be that as it may. You are not Robb, no more than I am Robert.   The harsh words had blown away whatever sympathy Jon might have had for Stannis.  I loved my brother,  he said.   And I mine. Yet they were what they were, and so are we. I am the only true king in Westeros, north or south. And you are Ned Stark’s bastard.  Stannis studied him with those dark blue eyes.  Tywin Lannister has named Roose Bolton his Warden of the North, to reward him for betraying your brother. The ironmen are fighting amongst themselves since Balon Greyjoy’s death, yet they still hold Moat Cailin, Deepwood Motte, Torrhen’s Square, and most of the Stony Shore. Your father’s lands are bleeding, and I have neither the strength nor the time to stanch the wounds. What is needed is a Lord of Winterfell. A loyal Lord of Winterfell.   He is looking at me, Jon thought, stunned.  Winterfell is no more. Theon Greyjoy put it to the torch.    Granite does not burn easily,  Stannis said.  The castle can be rebuilt, in time. It’s not the walls that make a lord, it’s the man, Your northmen do not know me, have no reason to love me, yet I will need their strength in the battles yet to come. I need a son of Eddard Stark to win them to my banner.   He would make me Lord of Winterfell. The wind was gusting, and Jon felt so light-headed he was half afraid it would blow him off the Wall.  Your Grace,  he said,  you forget. I am a Snow, not a Stark.    It’s you who are forgetting,  King Stannis replied.  Melisandre put a warm hand on Jon’s arm.  A king can remove the taint of bastardy with a stroke, Lord Snow.   Lord Snow. Ser Alliser Thorne had named him that, to mock his bastard birth. Many of his brothers had taken to using it as well, some with affection, others to wound. But suddenly it had a different sound to it in Jon’s ears. It sounded… real.  Yes,  he said, hesitantly,  kings have legitimized bastards before, but… I am still a brother of the Night’s Watch. I knelt before a heart tree and swore to hold no lands and father no children.    Jon.  Melisandre was so close he could feel the warmth of her breath.  R’hllor is the only true god. A vow sworn to a tree has no more power than one sworn to your shoes. Open your heart and let the light of the Lord come in. Burn these weirwoods, and accept Winterfell as a gift of the Lord of Light.   When Jon had been very young, too young to understand what it meant to be a bastard, he used to dream that one day Winterfell might be his."
