The  Middle  Days  are  passing. The Younger Days are  beginning. The time of the Elves is over, but  our time is at hand: the world of Men, which  we must rule. But we must have  power, power to order all things as  we  will, for that good  which only the  Wise can see.       '  \"And listen, Gandalf,  my old friend and  helper! \"  he said, coming  near and speaking now in a softer voice.  \"I said we,  for we it may be,  if  you will join with me. A new Power is rising. Against it the old  allies and  policies will not avail us  at all. There is no hope left in Elves  or dying  NÂ®menor. This then  is  one  choice before you. before us. We may jo in  with  that Power. It would be wise, Gandalf.  There is hope that way.  Its victory  is at hand; and  there will be rich reward for those that  aided it.  As the  Power grows, its proved friends will also  grow; and  the Wise, such  as you   and I, may with patience come at last to direct its courses,  to control it.  We  can bide  our time, we can keep our  thoughts in our  hearts,  deploring  maybe  evils done by the way,  but  approving the high and ultimate purpose:  Knowledge, Rule, Order; all the  things that  we have so far striven in vain  to accomplish,  hindered rather than helped by  our weak  or  idle  friends.   There need not be, there would not be, any  real change in our designs, only   in our means.\"       ' \"Saruman,\" I said, \"I  have  heard  speeches  of this kind before, but  only in the mouths of emissaries sent from Mordor to deceive the ignorant. I   cannot think that you brought me so far only to weary my ears.\"       'He looked at me sidelong, and paused a while considering. \"Well, I see  that this wi se course  does  not commend itself to you,\"  he said. \"Not yet?   Not if some better way can be contrived? \"       `He came and laid his long hand on my arm.  \"And why not, Gandalf? \" he  whispered. \"Why not? The Ruling Ring? If  we could  command that,  then  the  Power would pass to us. That is in truth why I brought  you here. For I have  many eyes  in my service, and  I  believe that  you know where this precious  thing now lies. Is it not so? Or why do the Nine ask for the Shire, and what  is your  business there? \" As he said this a lust which he could not conceal  shone suddenly in his eyes.        ' \"Saruman,\" I  said, standing away from him, \"only one hand at  a time  can wield the One, and you know that well, so do not trouble to say we!  But  I would not give it, nay, I would not give even news of it to you, now  that   ####-I  learn  your  mind. You  were head of  the Council, but you have  unmasked  yourself at last. Well, the choices are, it seems, to  submit to  Sauron, or  to yourself. I will take neither. Have you others to offer? \"       'He was cold now and perilous. \"Yes,\" he said. \"I did not expect you to  show wisdom, even in your own behalf; but I gave you the chance of aiding me  willingly. and so saving yourself much trouble and pain. The third choice is  to stay here, until the end.\"       ' \"Until what end? \"       ' \"Until you reveal to me where the One may be found. I may find  means  to  persuade you. Or until  it is found in your despite, and  the Ruler  has  time to turn to lighter matters:  to devise, say,  a  fitting reward for the  hindrance and insolence of Gandalf the Grey.\"       ' \"That  may not prove to be one of the lighter matters,\"  said  I.  He  laughed at me, for my words were empty, and he knew it.       `They took me and they set me alone  on the p innacle of Orthanc, in the  place  where Saruman was accustomed to watch the stars.  There is no descent  save  by a narrow stair of many  thousand steps, and  the valley below seems  far away. I looked  on it and saw that, whereas it  had once been  green and  fair, it was now filled with pits and forges. Wolves and orcs were housed in  Isengard,  for Saruman was mustering a  great force  on his  own account, in  rivalry of Sauron  and  not  in his service yet. Over  all his works  a dark  smoke hung  and wrapped itself about the sides  of Orthanc. I stood alone on   an island  in the clouds; and I had  no  chance  of escape, and my days were  bitter. I was pierced with cold, and I  had but little room in which to pace  to and fro, brooding on the coming of the Riders to the North.       `That the Nine had indeed arisen I felt  assured, apart from  the words  of Saruman which might  be  lies.  Long ere I came to  Isengard I had  heard  tidings by the way that could not be mistaken. Fear was ever in my heart for   my friends in the Shire; but still I had some  hope.  I hoped that Frodo had  set forth at once, as my letter had urged, and that he had reached Rivendell  before  the deadly pursuit  began."
