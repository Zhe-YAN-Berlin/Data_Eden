Right at his feet were  two  orc-archers with knives  sticking  in their backs. Beyond lay many  more shapes;  some singly as they  had been hewn  down or shot;  others in pairs, still  grappling one another,  dead  in  the very  throes  of stabbing, throttling, biting. The stones were  slippery with dark blood.       Two liveries Sam noticed, one  marked  by the  Red  Eye, the other by a   Moon disfigured with a ghastly  face of death;  but he did not  stop to look   more closely.  Across the court a  great door at the foot of the Tower stood  half  open,  and a red light came through; a large  orc  lay dead  upon  the  threshold. Sam sprang over the body and went in; and then he peered about at  a loss.       A  wide  and  echoing  passage led  back  from  the  door  towards  the  mountain-side. It  was  dimly  lit with torches flaring  in  brackets on the  walls, but its distant end was lost in gloom. Many doors  and openings could  be seen on this  side and  that; but it was empty save for two or three more  bodies sprawling on the  floor. From what he had heard of the captains' talk   Sam knew that, dead  or alive, Frodo would most likely be found in a chamber   high up  in the turret far above; but he  might search for  a day  before he  found the way.       'It'll  be near  the back, I  guess,' Sam  muttered.  `The  whole Tower   climbs backwards-like. And anyway I'd better follow these lights.'       He advanced down the passage, but slowly now, each step more reluctant.  Terror  was beginning to grip him again. There was no sound save the  rap of  his feet, which seemed to  grow to  an echoing noise,  like  the slapping of  great hands upon  the stones. The dead bodies: the emptiness; the dank black  walls  that in the torchlight seemed to drip with blood; the  fear of sudden  death lurking in doorway or  shadow;  and behind all  his mind  the  waiting   watchful malice at the gate: it  was almost more than he could  screw himself  to  face. He would have welcomed a fight-with not too many enemies at a time  - rather than this hideous brooding uncertainty. He forced himself to  think   of Frodo,  lying bound or  in pain or dead somewhere in this dreadful place.   He went on.       He had passed  beyond  the torchlight, almost to a great arched door at  the end  of  the passage, the inner side of  the under gate, as  he  rightly  guessed,  when  there  came  from high above a dreadful  choking shriek.  He  stopped short. Then he heard feet coming. Someone was running in great haste   ####-down an echoing stairway overhead.       His  will was too weak and slow to restrain his hand. It dragged at the  chain and  clutched  the Ring. But Sam did  not put  it  on; for even as  he  clasped it to his breast, an orc came clattering down. Leaping out of a dark  opening at the right, it ran towards him. It was no more than six paces from  him  when,  lifting its head, it  saw him;  and  Sam  could hear its gasping  breath and see the glare in its bloodshot eyes. It stopped short aghast. For   what it saw was not a small frightened hobbit trying to hold a steady sword:   it saw a great silent shape, cloaked in  a grey shadow, looming against  the  wavering light behind; in one hand it held a sword, the very  light of which  was a bitter pain, the other was clutched  at its breast, but held concealed  some nameless menace of power and doom.       For a moment the orc crouched, and then with a hideous yelp  of fear it  turned and fled back as it had come. Never  was  any dog more heartened when  its  enemy turned  tail  than Sam at this unexpected flight. With a shout he  gave chase.       `Yes! The Elf-warrior is loose!'  he  cried. 'I'm coming. Just you show  me the way up, or I'll skin you! '       But  the orc  was  in its own haunts,  nimble  and  well -fed. Sam was a   stranger, hungry and weary.  The stairs  were  high  and  steep and winding.   Sam's breath began to come in gasps. The orc had soon passed  out  of sight,   and now only faintly   could be  heard the slapping of its feet as it went on  and  up. Every now  and again it gave  a yell, and  the  echo  ran along the  walls. But slowly all sound of it died away.       Sam plodded on.  He felt that he was on the right road, and his spirits  had risen a  good  deal.  He thrust  the Ring away  and tightened his  belt.  `Well, well!'  he said. `If only  they all take such a  dislike to me and my  Sting, this  may  turn out  better than  I hoped. And anyway it looks  as if  Shagrat, Gorbag, and company  have done nearly all my job for me. Except for   that little frightened rat, I do believe  there's  nobody left alive  in the  place!'       And with  that  he stopped, brought up  hard, as if he had hit his head  against the stone wall. The full meaning of what he had said struck him like  a  blow. Nobody  left alive!  Whose had  been that  horrible  dying  shriek?  `Frodo, Frodo! Master!' he cried half sobbing."
