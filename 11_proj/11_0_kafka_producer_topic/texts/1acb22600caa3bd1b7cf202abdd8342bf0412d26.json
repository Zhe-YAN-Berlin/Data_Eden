The Imp’s gone out to drive them off.    That will fill them with fear,  the queen said dryly.  He hasn’t taken Joff, I hope.    No, Y’Grace, the king’s with my brother at the Whores, flinging Antler Men into the river.    With the Mud Gate under assault? Folly. Tell Ser Osmund I want him out of there at once, it’s too dangerous. Fetch him back to the castle.    The Imp said—    It’s what I said that ought concern you.  Cersei’s eyes narrowed.  Your brother will do as he’s told, or I’ll see to it that he leads the next sortie himself, and you’ll go with him.   After the meal had been cleared away, many of the guests asked leave to go to the sept. Cersei graciously granted their request. Lady Tanda and her daughters were among those who fled. For those who remained, a singer was brought forth to fill the hall with the sweet music of the high harp. He sang of Jonquil and Florian, of Prince Aemon the Dragonknight and his love for his brother’s queen, of Nymeria’s ten thousand ships. They were beautiful songs, but terribly sad. Several of the women began to weep, and Sansa felt her own eyes growing moist.   Very good, dear.  The queen leaned close.  You want to practice those tears. You’ll need them for King Stannis.   Sansa shifted nervously.  Your Grace?    Oh, spare me your hollow courtesies. Matters must have reached a desperate strait out there if they need a dwarf to lead them, so you might as well take off your mask. I know all about your little treasons in the godswood.    The godswood?  Don’t look at Ser Dontos, don’t, don’t, Sansa told herself. She doesn’t know, no one knows, Dontos promised me, my Florian would never fail me.  I’ve done no treasons. I only visit the godswood to pray.    For Stannis. Or your brother, it’s all the same. Why else seek your father’s gods? You’re praying for our defeat. What would you call that, if not treason?    I pray for Joffrey,  she insisted nervously.   Why, because he treats you so sweetly?  The queen took a flagon of sweet plum wine from a passing serving girl and filled Sansa’s cup.  Drink,  she commanded coldly.  Perhaps it will give you the courage to deal with truth for a change.   Sansa lifted the cup to her lips and took a sip. The wine was cloyingly sweet, but very strong.   You can do better than that,  Cersei said.  Drain the cup, Sansa. Your queen commands you.  It almost gagged her, but Sansa emptied the cup, gulping down the thick sweet wine until her head was swimming.   More?  Cersei asked.   No. Please.   The queen looked displeased.  When you asked about Ser Ilyn earlier, I lied to you. Would you like to hear the truth, Sansa? Would you like to know why he’s really here?   She did not dare answer, but it did not matter. The queen raised a hand and beckoned, never waiting for a reply. Sansa had not even seen Ser Ilyn return to the hall, but suddenly there he was, striding from the shadows behind the dais as silent as a cat. He carried Ice unsheathed. Her father had always cleaned the blade in the godswood after he took a man’s head, Sansa recalled, but Ser Ilyn was not so fastidious. There was blood drying on the rippling steel, the red already fading to brown.  Tell Lady Sansa why I keep you by us,  said Cersei.  Ser Ilyn opened his mouth and emitted a choking rattle. His pox-scarred face had no expression.   He’s here for us, he says,  the queen said.  Stannis may take the city and he may take the throne, but I will not suffer him to judge me. I do not mean for him to have us alive.    Us?    You heard me. So perhaps you had best pray again, Sansa, and for a different outcome. The Starks will have no joy from the fall of House Lannister, I promise you.  She reached out and touched Sansa’s hair, brushing it lightly away from her neck.      TYRION  The slot in his helm limited Tyrion’s vision to what was before him, but when he turned his head he saw three galleys beached on the tourney grounds, and a fourth, larger than the others, standing well out into the river, firing barrels of burning pitch from a catapult.   Wedge,  Tyrion commanded as his men streamed out of the sally port. They formed up in spearhead, with him at the point. Ser Mandon Moore took the place to his right, flames shimmering against the white enamel of his armor, his dead eyes shining passionlessly through his helm. He rode a coal-black horse barded all in white, with the pure white shield of the Kingsguard strapped to his arm. On the left, Tyrion was surprised to see Podrick Payne, a sword in his hand.  You’re too young,  he said at once.  Go back.    I’m your squire, my lord.   Tyrion could spare no time for argument.  With me, then. Stay close.  He kicked his horse into motion.  They rode knee to knee, following the line of the looming walls. Joffrey’s standard streamed crimson and gold from Ser Mandon’s staff, stag and lion dancing hoof to paw."
