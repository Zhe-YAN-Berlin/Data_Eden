We shall be hard put to  it.  We  should be  very hard put to it, even if it were not for this dreadful chance.       'The Enemy  still lacks one thing to give him strength and knowledge to  beat down all resistance,  break the last defences, and cover  all the lands  in a second darkness. He lacks the One Ring.       'The  Three, fairest of all, the Elf-lords hid  from him, and  his hand  never touched  them or  sullied them. Seven the  Dwarf-kings possessed,  but  three he  has recovered,  and the others the  dragons have consumed. Nine he  gave  to  Mortal Men,  proud and great, and so ensnared them. Long ago  they  fell under  the dominion  of the One, and they became  Ringwraiths,  shadows  under  his  great Shadow, his most terrible servants. Long ago. It is many a   year since the Nine walked abroad. Yet who  knows?  As the Shadow grows  once  more, they too may walk again. But  come!  We will not speak of such  things  even in the morning of the Shire.       'So it is now: the Nine he has gathered to himself; the Seven also,  or   else  they are  destroyed.  The Three are hidden still.  But that no  longer   troubles him. He only  needs the One; for he made  that Ring himself, it  is  his, and he let a great part of his  own former power pass  into it, so that  he could rule all the other s.  If he recovers it, then he  will command them  all again, wherever they be,  even the Three, and  all that has been wrought  with them will be laid bare, and he will be stronger than ever.       'And this  is the dreadful chance, Frodo. He believed that the  One had  perished; that the Elves had destroyed it, as should have been  done. But he  knows now that it has not perished, that it has been found. So he is seeking  it, seeking it, and all his thought is bent  on it. It is his great hope and  our great fear. '       'Why,  why wasn't it destroyed?'  cried Frodo. 'And how  did  the Enemy   ever come to lose it, if  he  was so strong, and it was so precious to him?'  He  clutched  the Ring  in his hand,  as  if  he saw  already  dark  fingers  stretching out to seize it.       'It  was taken from him,' said Gandalf.  'The  strength of the Elves to  resist  him was greater long ago; and  not all Men were estranged from them.  The  Men of Westernesse  came  to their aid. That  is a  chapter of  ancient   ####-history which it might be good to recall; for there was sorrow then too, and  gathering dark, but great valour, and great deeds that were not wholly vain.  One day, perhaps, I will tell you all the tale, or you shall hear it told in  full by one who knows it best.       'But for the moment, since most of all you need to know how  this thing  came to  you, and that will be tale enough, this is all that  I will say. It  was Gil-galad,  Elven-king and Elendil  of Westernesse who overthrew Sauron,  though they themselves perished in the  deed; and Isildur Elendil's son  cut  the  Ring  from  Sauron's hand and  took  it  for his own.  Then  Sauron was  vanquished  and  his  spirit fled and was hidden for long  years,  until his  shadow took shape again in Mirkwood.       'But  the  Ring was  lost. It fell  into  the Great  River, Anduin,  and  vanished. For Isildur was marching north  along the east banks of the River,   and near the Gladden Fields he was waylaid by the Orcs of the Mountains, and  almost all his folk  were slain. He leaped  into the waters,  but  the  Ring  slipped from his finger as he swam, and then the Orcs saw him and killed him  with arrows.'       Gandalf paused. 'And there in the dark pools amid the  Gladden Fields,'  he said, 'the Ring passed out  of knowledge and legend; and even so much  of  its history is known now  only to a few, and the Council of the  Wise  could  discover no more. But at last I can carry on the story, I think.       'Long  after, but  still very long ago, there lived by the banks of the  Great River  on  the edge of  Wilderland  a  clever -handed  and quiet-footed  little people. I guess they were of hobbit-kind; akin to the fathers of  the  fathers  of the Stoors, for they loved  the  River, and often swam in it, or   made  little  boats  of reeds. There was among them a family of high repute,   for it was  large and wealthier than most, and it was ruled by a grandmother   of  the  folk, stern  and  wise  in old lore,  such  as they  had. The  most  inquisitive and  curious-minded of that  family was called  Smjagol. He  was  interested in  roots and beginnings; he dived into  deep pools; he  burrowed  under  trees and  growing plants; he tunnelled  into green  mounds;  and  he  ceased to  look up at the hill -tops, or the leaves on trees, or  the flowers  opening in the air: his head and his eyes were downward.       'He had a  friend  called Djagol, of similar sort, sharper -eyed but not  so quick and strong."
