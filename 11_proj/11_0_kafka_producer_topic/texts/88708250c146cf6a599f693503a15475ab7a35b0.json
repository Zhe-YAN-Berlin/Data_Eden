'You rascals, you woolly-footed and  wool-pated truants!  A fine  hunt you  have  led  us! Two  hundred  leagues,   through  fen and forest, battle  and death, to  rescue you! And here we find  you feasting and  idling-and smoking!  Smoking! Where did  you  come  by the  weed, you villains?  Hammer and  tongs!  I am so torn between  rage and joy,  that if I do not burst. it will be a marvel!'       'You  speak  for  me, Gimli,' laughed Legolas.  'Though I would  sooner   learn how they came by the wine.'       'One thing you  have  not found  in your hunting,  and that's  brighter  wits,' said  Pippin, opening an eye. 'Here you find us sitting on a field of  victory, amid  the plunder of armies, and  you wonder how we  came by  a few  well-earned comforts!'       'Well-earned?' said Gimli. 'I cannot believe that!'       The  Riders laughed. 'It cannot be doubted  that we witness the meeting  of dear friends,' said Thjoden. 'So these are the lost ones of your company,  Gandalf? The days are fated  to  be filled with marvels.  Already I have seen    ####-many since I left my house; and now here before my eyes stand yet another of  the folk of legend. Are not these the Halflings, that some among us call the  Holbytlan?'       'Hobbits, if you please, lord,' said Pippin.       'Hobbits?'  said Thjoden. 'Your  tongue is  strangely changed; but  the  name sounds  not  unfitting so.  Hobbits! No report that I have  heard  does  justice to the truth.'       Merry  bowed; and Pippin got up and bowed low. 'You are gracious, lord;  or I hope  that I may so take your words,'  he said.  'And  here is  another   marvel! I have wandered in  many lands, since I left my home, and never till  now have I found people that knew any story concerning hobbits.'       'My people came out of the North long  ago,' said  Thjoden. 'But I will  not deceive  you: we know no tales  about hobbits. All that is said among us  is that far away, over many hills and  rivers, live  the halfling folk  that  dwell in holes in sand-dunes. But there are no legends of their  deeds.  for  it  is said that they do little, and avoid the sight of  men, being able  to  vanish in  a  twinkling: and they  can change their voices  to  resemble the  piping of birds. But it seems that more could be said.'       'It could indeed, lord,' said Merry.       'For one thing,' said Thjoden, 'I had not heard that they spouted smoke  from their mouths.'       'That is not surprising,'  answered Merry; 'for  it is an art which  we  have  not  practised  for  more  than  a  few  generations.  It  was  Tobold  Hornblower,  of Longbottom  in the Southfarthing,  who  first grew  the true  pipe-weed  in his gardens, about  the year  1070 according to our reckoning.   How old Toby came by the plant...'       'You do  not  know your  danger,  Thjoden,' interrupted Gandalf. 'These  hobbits will sit on the edge of ruin and discuss the pleasures of the table,  or the small doings of  their fathers, grandfathers, and great-grandfathers,   and  remoter cousins to the ninth degree,  if  you encourage them with undue  patience. Some  other time wou ld be more fitting for the history of smoking.  Where is Treebeard, Merry?'       'Away on the north side, I believe. He went to  get  a  drink-of  clean  water. Most of the other Ents are with him, still busy at their work -- over   there.' Merry waved his hand towards the steaming lake; and as  they looked,  they heard a  distant rumbling and rattling, as if an avalanche was  falling  from  the  mountain-side.  Far  away  came a  hoom-hom, as of  horns blowing   ####-triumphantly.       'And is Orthanc then left unguarded?' asked Gandalf.        'There is  the water,' said Merry. 'But Quickbeam and  some  others are  watching it. Not all those posts and pillars in the plain  are of  Saruman's  planting. Quickbeam, I think, is by the rock, near the foot of the stair.'       'Yes, a tall grey Ent is there,' said Legolas, 'but his arms are at his  sides, and he stands as still as a door -tree.'       'It is  past  noon,'  said Gandalf, 'and we at any  rate have not eaten  since early morning. Yet I wish  to  see Treebeard as soon as may be. Did he   leave me no message, or has plate and bottle driven it from your mind?'       'He left a message,' said  Merry, 'and  I was coming to  it, but I have  been hindered by many other questions. I was to say that, if the Lord of the  Mark and Gandalf  will ride  to  the northern wall  they will find Treebeard  there,  and he will welcome them. I may add that they will also find food of  the best there, it  was discovered and selected by your humble servants.' He  bowed.       Gandalf laughed. 'That is  better!' he  said. 'Well,  Thjoden. will you   ride with me  to find Treebeard?  We must go round about, but it is not far.  When you see Treebeard,  you will learn much."
