The horses  would not  pass the threatening stone, until the riders dismounted and led them  about.  And so they came at last deep into the glen; and there stood a sheer wall of  rock, and in  the wall the Dark  Door  gaped  before them like  the mouth of  night.  Signs and figures were  carved above its  wide arch too dim to read,  and fear flowed from it like a grey vapour.       The company halted, and there was  not a  heart among them that did not   quail, unless it were the heart of Legolas of the Elves, for whom the ghosts  of Men have no terror.       'This is an  evil door,' said Halbarad, 'and my death lies beyond it. I  will dare to pass it nonetheless; but no horse will enter.'       'But  we must go  in,  and therefore  the horses  must  go  too,'  said  Aragorn.  'For if ever  we  come  through this  darkness,  many  leagues lie  beyond, and every hour  that is lost there will bring the triumph  of Sauron  nearer. Follow me!'       Then Aragorn led the way, and such was the strength of his will in that  hour  that all the DÂ®nedain and  their horses  followed him. And  indeed the  love that the horses of the Rangers bore for their riders was  so great that  they were willing  to face even the  terror  of the Door, if  their masters'  hearts were steady as they walked beside them. But Arod, the horse of Rohan,  refused  the  way, and he stood sweating and trembling  in a  fear  that was  grievous to see. Then Legolas laid his hands on his eyes and sang some words  that  went  soft in the  gloom, until he  suffered himself  to  be  led, and  Legolas passed in. And there stood Gimli the Dwarf left all alone.       His knees shook,  and  he  was wroth  with himself.  'Here is  a  thing  unheard of!' he said. 'An  Elf  will go underground and a  Dwarf  dare not!'  With that he plunged in. But it seemed to him  that he dragged his feet like   ####-lead over the threshold; and at once a blindness  came  upon him,  even upon  Gimli Gluin's son who had walked unafraid in many deep places of the world.       Aragorn  had  brought  torches from Dunharrow,  and  now he went  ahead  bearing one  aloft; and Elladan with  another went  at the rear, and  Gimli,  stumbling behind, strove to overtake him. He could  see nothing  but the dim  flame  of the tor ches; but  if the company halted, there  seemed  an endless  whisper of voices all about him, a murmur of words in no tongue  that he had  ever heard before.       Nothing assailed  the  company  nor  withstood  their passage,  and yet  steadily fear grew on the Dwarf as  he went on:  most of all because he knew  now that there could be no  turning back; all the paths behind were thronged  by an unseen host that followed in the dark.       So time unreckoned passed, until Gimli  saw a  sight that he  was  ever  afterwards loth to recall. The road was  wide, as far as he could judge, but  now the company came  suddenly  into a great empty space, and there  were no  longer any walls upon either side. The dread  was  so  heavy on him  that he  could  hardly walk. Away  to the  left  something glittered  in the gloom as  Aragorn's  torch drew near.  Then Aragorn halted and  went  to look  what it   might be.       'Does  he  feel no fear?' muttered the  Dwarf. 'In any other cave Gimli  Gluin's son would have been  the first to run to the gleam of gold.  But not  here! Let it lie!'       Nonetheless he drew near,  and saw Aragorn kneeling, while Elladan held  aloft both torches. Before him were the bones of  a  mighty man. He had been  clad  in  mail, and still his harness lay there  whole; for the cavern's air  was as dry as dust, and his  hauberk  was gilded. His belt  was  of gold and  garnets, and rich with gold was the helm upon his bony head face downward on  the floor. He  had fallen  near the far  wall  of the cave, as now could  be  seen, and before  him stood a  stony door closed fast: his finger -bones were  still clawing at the cracks. A notched and broken sword lay by him, as if he  had hewn at the rock in his last despair.       Aragorn did  not touch him, but after gazing silently for  a  while  he  rose  and sighed. 'Hither  shall the flowers of  simbelmynl come never  unto  world's  end,' he murmured. 'Nine mounds and seven there are now  green with  grass, and through all the long years he has lain at the door that  he could  not unlock. Whither does it lead? Why would he pass? None shall ever know!        'For that is not my errand!' he cried, turning back and speaking to the   ####-whispering darkness behind. 'Keep your hoards and your secrets hidden in the  Accursed Years! Speed only we ask.  Let us pass, and then come! I summon  you  to the Stone of Erech!'       There was no answer, unless it were an utter silence more dreadful than  the whispers  before;  and  then  a chill  blast came in  which  the torches  flickered and  went  out,  and could not be  rekindled."
