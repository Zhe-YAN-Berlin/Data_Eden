  "text": "       `Well, I can  remember three  nights  there for certain,  and I seem to  remember several more, but I would   take my oath it was never a whole month.  Anyone would think that time did not count in there! '       `And perhaps that was the way of it,' said Frodo. `In that land, maybe,  we  were in  a time that has elsewhere long gone by. It was  not,  I  think,  until Silverlode bore us  back to Anduin that we returned  to the time  that  flows through mortal lands to the Great Sea. And I don't  remember any moon,  either new or old, in Caras Galadhon: only stars by night and sun by day.'       Legolas stirred in his boa t. `Nay, time does  not tarry ever,' he said;  `but change and growth is not in all  things and places alike. For the Elves  the world moves, and it  moves both very swift and very slow. Swift, because  they  themselves change little,  and all else  fleets by:  it is a  grief to  them. Slow, because they do not count the running years, not for themselves.  The  passing seasons are but ripples ever repeated in  the long long stream.  Yet beneath the Sun all things must wear to an end at last.'       `But the wearing is slow in Lurien,' said Frodo. `The power of the Lady  is on it.  Rich are  the hours,  though short they  seem, in Caras Galadhon,  where Galadriel wields the Elven -ring.'       'That should not have  been said  outside Lurien, not even to me,' said  Aragorn. `Speak no more of it! But so it is, Sam: in that land you lost your  count.  There time  flowed swiftly by  us,  as  for the Elves. The  old moon  passed,  and  a new  moon waxed  and waned  in  the world  outside, while we  tarried there. And yestereve a  new  moon came again.  Winter is nearly gone.  Time flows on to a spring of little hope.'       The night passed silently. No voice or call was heard again  across the  water. The  travellers  huddled  in  their  boats  felt the  changing of the  weather. The air grew  warm and very still under the great moist clouds that  had floated up from the South and the distant seas. The rushing of the River   over the rocks of the rapids seemed to grow  louder and closer. The twigs of  the trees above them began to drip.   ####-     When the day came the mood of the world about them had become soft  and  sad. Slowly  the dawn grew  to a  pale light, diffused and shadowless. There  was mist on the River, and white fog  swathed the shore; the far  bank could  not be seen.       `I can't abide fog,' said  Sam; `but this  seems to be a lucky one. Now  perhaps we can get away without those cursed goblins seeing us.'       `Perhaps so,'  said Aragorn. `But it  will  be  hard to find  the  path  unless the fog lifts a little later on. And we must find the path, if we are  to pass Sarn Gebir and come to the Emyn Muil.'       'I  do  not see why we should pass the Rapids or follow the  River  any  further,' said Boromir. `If the Emyn Muil lie before us, then we can abandon  these cockle-boats, and strike westward and southward, until we come to  the  Entwash and cross into my own land.'       `We can, if we are making for Minas Tirith,' said Aragorn, `but that is  not yet agreed. And such a course  may be more perilous than  it sounds. The  vale of Entwash is flat and fenny, and fog is a deadly peril there for those  on foot and laden. I would not abandon our boats until we must. The River is  at least a path that cannot be missed.'       `But the Enemy holds the eastern bank,' objected  Boromir. `And even if  you pass the Gates  of  Argonath and come  unmolested  to the Tindrock, what  will you do then? Leap down the Falls and land in the marshes? '       `No! ' answered Aragorn. `Say rather that we will bear our boats by the  ancient  way to  Rauros-foot, and  there take to the water again. Do you not  know, Boromir, or do you choose to forget the North Stair, and the high seat  upon  Amon Hen,  that were made in the  days of the great  kings? I at least  have a mind  to stand in that high place again,  before I decide  my further   course. There, maybe, we shall see some sign that will guide us.'       Boromir held out  long  against this choice;  but  when it became plain  that Frodo  would  follow Aragorn, wherever he went, he gave  in. 'It is not  the  way  of the  Men of Minas Tirith to  desert their friends at  need,' he  said, `and you will need my strength, if ever you are to reach the Tindrock.  To the tall isle I will go, but no further. There  I shall  turn to my home,  alone if my help has not earned the reward of any companionship.'       The day  was  now  growing,  and  the fog  had lifted a  little. It was  decided that Aragorn and Legolas should at once go forward along the  shore,  while the  others remained  by the  boats. Aragorn hoped to find some way by  which they could carry  both  their boats and their  baggage to the smoother    ####-water beyond the Rapids.        `Boats of the Elves would not sink, maybe,' he said, `but that does not  say that  we should come through Sarn  Gebir  alive."
