Then they scattered and vanished. Men came galloping  back  over the  field and  up the ramp to  the  gate of  the  Hornburg.  The  rearguard of the Westfolders had been driven in.       'The enemy is at hand!' they said. 'We loosed every arrow  that we had,   ####-and  filled the Dike with Orcs. But it will not halt them long. Already they  are  scaling the bank at many  points,  thick as marching ants. But we  have  taught them not to carry torches.'       It was  now past  midnight. The sky was utterly dark, and the stillness  of the  heavy  air foreboded storm.  Suddenly  the  clouds were  seared by a   blinding flash. Branched lightning smote down upon the eastward hills. For a  staring moment the watchers  on the walls saw all the space between them and  the  Dike lit with white  light: it  was  boiling  and  crawling  with black   shapes. some squat and broad, some  tall and grim, with high helms and sable  shields. Hundreds and hundreds more  were pouring over the Dike and  through  the breach.  The dark tide flowed  up to  the  walls  from  cliff  to cliff.  Thunder rolled in the valley. Rain came lashing down.       Arrows thick  as the rain came whistling over the battlements, and fell  clinking  and glancing on the stones. Some  found  a  mark.  The  assault on   Helm's Deep  had  begun, but  no  sound  or challenge  was heard within;  no  answering arrows came.       The  assailing  hosts halted, foiled  by the silent menace  of rock and  wall. Ever and again  the lightning  tore aside the darkness.  Then the Orcs  screamed, waving spear and sword, and shooting a cloud of arrows at any that  stood  revealed upon the battlements;  and the men of the Mark amazed looked  out,  as it seemed  to them, upon a great field of  dark corn, tossed  by  a   tempest of war, and every ear glinted with barbed light.       Brazen trumpets sounded.  The enemy surged  forward,  some against  the  Deeping Wall,  other  towards the causeway a nd  the ramp that led up to  the   Hornburg-gates. There the hugest Orcs were mustered, and the wild men of the  Dunland fells. A moment they hesitated and then  on they came. The lightning  flashed,  and blazoned  upon  every helm  and  shield  the  ghastly  hand of  Isengard was seen: They reached the summit of the  rock;  they drove towards  the gates.        Then at last an answer came: a storm of arrows met them,  and a hail of  stones. They  wavered, broke, and fled  back; and  then charged again, broke  and charged  again; and each time, like  the incoming sea, they  halted at a   higher point. Again trumpets rang, and a press of roaring  men leaped forth.   They held their great shields  above them like a roof, while in  their midst  they  bore two trunks of  mighty  trees.  Behind  them orc-archers  crowded,   sending a hail  of  darts against the bowmen on the walls. They  gained  the  gates. The  trees, swung by  strong  arms, smote the timbers  with a rending   ####-boom. If any man fell,  crushed by a stone hurtling  from above,  two others  sprang to take his place. Again and again the great rams swung and crashed.       Jomer and Aragorn stood  together on  the Deeping Wall. They heard  the  roar  of voices and the thudding of  the rams; and then in a sudden flash of  light they beheld the peril of the gates.        'Come!' said Aragorn. 'This is the hour when we draw swords together!'       Running  like fire, they  sped along  the  wall, and up the  steps, and  passed  into the  outer  court  upon the Rock.  As they  ran they gathered a   handful of stout swordsmen. There was a small postern-door that opened in an  angle of the burg-wall on the west, where the cliff  stretched  out to  meet  it. On that side a narrow path ran round towards the great gate, between the  wall and the  sheer brink of  the Rock.  Together Jomer  and Aragorn  sprang  through the door, their men close behind. The swords flashed from the sheath  as one.       'G®thwinl!' cried Jomer. 'G®thwinl for the Mark!'       'And®ril!' cried Aragorn. 'And®ril for the D®nedain!'       Charging  from  the side,  they  hurled themselves  upon the  wild men.  And®ril rose and fell,  gleaming with white fire. A shout went  up from wall  and tower: 'And®ril! And®ril goes to  war. The Blade that  was Broken shines  again!'       Dismayed  the  rammers let fall the trees and turned to fight;  but the  wall of their shields  was broken as by  a  lightning-stroke, and  they were  swept  away, hewn down,  or cast over the Rock into the stony stream  below.   The orc-archers shot wildly and then fled.       For a moment Jomer and Aragorn halted before the gates. The thunder was  rumbling in  the distance now.  The lightning flickered still, far off among  the mountains  in the  South. A keen wind was blowing from  the North again."
