Our part will end later  -- or sooner.'       'And then we can have some rest and  some sleep,' said Sam.  He laughed   grimly.  'And I  mean just  that, Mr. Frodo. I mean plain ordinary rest, and  sleep, and  waking up  to a morning's work in the garden. I'm afraid  that's  all I'm hoping for all the time. All the big important  plans are not for my  sort. Still, I wonder if we shall ever be put into songs  or tales. We're in  one,  or course; but I mean: put into words, you know, told by the fireside,  or read out of a great big book with red  and black letters, years and years  afterwards. And people will say: \"Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring! \" And  they'll say: \"Yes, that's one of my favourite stories. Frodo was very brave.  wasn't he, dad?\"  \"Yes, my boy, the  famousest of  the hobbits,  and  that's  saying a lot.\"'       `It's saying a lot too much,' said Frodo, and he laughed,  a long clear  laugh from  his heart. Such a sound had not been heard in those places since  Sauron came to Middle-earth. To Sam suddenly it seemed as if all the  stones  were listen ing and the  tall rocks leaning over them. But Frodo did not heed  them;  he laughed again. 'Why, Sam,' he said, 'to hear you somehow makes  me  as merry as if the story was already written. But you've left out one of the  chief characters: Samwise the stouthearted. \"I  want to hear more about Sam,  dad. Why  didn't they put  in more of his talk, dad? That's  what I like, it  makes me laugh. And Frodo wouldn't have  got far without Sam, would he,  dad?  \"  '       `Now, Mr. Frodo,' said Sam, 'you shouldn't make fun. I was serious. '       `So  was I,' said Frodo, 'and so I am. We're  going on a bit  too fast.  You and I, Sam, are still stuck in the worst places of the story, and it  is  all too likely that some will say at this point: \"Shut the book now, dad; we  don't want to read any more.\" '       `Maybe,' said Sam, 'but I wouldn't be one to say that.  Things done and  over and made into part of the great  tales are  different. Why, even Gollum  might be  good in a  tale,  better than he is to have by you, anyway. And he  used to like  tales himself once, by his own  account. I wonder if he thinks  he's the hero or the villain?        `Gollum!' he called. `Would  you like to be the hero  -- now where's  he  got to again?'   ####-     There was no  sign of  him at  the mouth  of their shelter nor  in  the  shadows near. He had refused their food, though he had, as usual, accepted a   mouthful of water; and then  he had seemed to curl up for a sleep:  They had  supposed that one at any  rate of his objects  in his  long absence  the day  befor e had been to hunt for food to his own liking; and now he had evidently  slipped off again while they talked. But what for this time?        `I don't like his sneaking off without saying,' said Sam. 'And least of  all now. He can't  be looking for food up here, not unless there's some kind  of rock he fancies. Why, there isn't even a bit of moss! '       `It's no  good worrying about him now,'  said  Frodo. `We couldn't have  got so  far,  not even within  sight of the pass, without  him, and so we'll  have to put up with his ways. If he's false, he's false.'       'All the same, I'd  rather have  him under  my eye,' said Sam. 'All the  more so, if  he's false. Do you remember he never would say if this pass was  guarded or no? And now we see a  tower there -- and it may be deserted,  and  it may  not. Do  you think he's gone to fetch  them, Orcs  or  whatever they  are?'       `No,  I  don't  think  so,'  answered Frodo.  'Even if he's up  to some  wickedness, and I suppose that's not unlikely, I don't think it's  that: no t  to  fetch Orcs,  or  any servants of the  Enemy.  Why wait till now,  and go  through all the labour of the climb, and come so near the land  he fears? He  could probably have  betrayed us to Orcs many times since we met him. No, if  it's  anything,  it wil l  be some  little private trick of  his  own-that he  thinks is quite secret.'       `Well,  I suppose  you're  right, Mr.  Frodo,'  said Sam.  'Not that it  comforts me mightily. I don't make no  mistake:  I  don't doubt he'd hand me   over  to Orcs  as  gladly  as kiss  his hand.  But  I was forgetting --  his  Precious. No, I  suppose the  whole  time it's  been The  Precious for  poor  Smjagol. That's the one idea in  all his little schemes, if he has any.  But  how bringing us up here will help him in that is more than I can guess.'       'Very  likely  he can't guess himself,' said Frodo. `And I don't  think   he's got just  one plain scheme in his muddled head. I think he really is in  part trying to save the Precious from the Enemy. as long as he can. For that  would be the last  disaster for himself too. if the Enemy got it. And in the  other part, perhaps, he's just biding his time and waiting on chance."
