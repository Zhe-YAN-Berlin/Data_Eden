  "text": " All shall love me and despair! '       She  lifted up her hand and from the  ring that she wore there issued a   great  light that  illuminated her  alone  and left all else dark. She stood  before  Frodo seeming  now  tall beyond  measurement, and  beautiful  beyond  enduring, terrible and worshipful. Then she let her hand fall, and the light  faded, and suddenly she laughed again, and  lo! she was  shrunken: a slender   elf-woman, clad in simple white, whose gentle voice was soft and sad.       'I pass the test,' she said. `I will diminish, and go into the West and  remain Galadriel.'       They stood for a long while in silence. At length the Lady spoke again.  `Let us return! ' she  said. `In the morning you must depart for now we have  chosen, and the tides of fate are flowing.'       `I  would  ask  one thing before we go,'  said Frodo, `a  thing which I  often meant to  ask  Gandalf in Rivendell. I  am permitted to  wear  the One  Ring: why  cannot I see all the others  and know the thoughts  of those that  wear them? '       `You have not tried,' she said. `Only thrice have you set the Ring upon  your finger since you knew what you possessed. Do not try!  It would destroy  you.  Did not Ganda lf tell  you that  the rings give power  according to the  measure of each possessor? Before you could use that power you would need  to  become far stronger, and to train your will to the domination of others. Yet  even so, as Ring-bearer and as one that has borne it on finger and seen that  which is hidden, your sight is grown keener. You  have perceived  my thought  more clearly than many  that are accounted wise. You saw the Eye of him that  holds the  Seven and the Nine.  And  did  you not see and recognize the ring  upon my finger? Did you see my ring? ' she asked turning again to Sam.       'No, Lady,' he  answered. `To tell you the truth, I  wondered what  you   were talking about.  I  saw a star through your finger. But if you'll pardon   ####-my speaking  out,  I think my master was right. I  wish you'd take his Ring.  You'd  put things  to  rights.  You'd  stop them digging up the  gaffer  and  turning him adrift. You'd make some folk pay for their dirty work.'       `I would,' she said. `That is how it would begin. Bu t it would not stop  with that, alas! We will not speak more of it. Let us go!'   ####-     Chapter 8. Farewell to Lurien            That  night  the Company was again summoned to the chamber of Celeborn,  and there the Lord and Lady greeted them with fair words. At length Celeborn  spoke of their departure.       `Now is the time,' he  said, `when those who wish to continue the Quest   must harden their hearts to leave this land.  Those who no longer wish to go   forward may remain here, for a while. But whether they stay or go, none  can  be sure of  peace.  For we are come now to  the edge of doom. Here those who  wish  may await  the oncoming of the hour till either the ways of  the world  lie open again. or we summon them to the  last need of Lurien. Then they may  return to their own lands, or else go to the long home of those that fall in  battle.'       There was a silence. `They all resolved to  go forward,' said Galadriel  looking in their eyes.       `As for me,' said Boromir, `my way home lies onward and not back.'       `That is true,' said Celeborn, `but is all this Company  going with you   to Minas Tirith? '       `We have not decided our course,' said Aragorn. 'Beyond Lothlurien I do  not know what Gandalf intended to do. Indeed I do not think that even he had  any clear purpose. '       `Maybe not,' said  Celeborn, `yet when you leave this land, you  can no  longer  forget  the Great  River.  As  some of you  know well, it  cannot be  crossed  by travellers with baggage between Lurien and Gondor, save by boat.  And are not the bridges  of Osgiliath broken down  and all the landings held  now by the Enemy?        `On which side will you journey? The way to Minas Tirith lies upon this  side, upon  the  west; but the straight road of the Quest  lies east of  the  River, upon the darker shore. Which shore will you now take?  '       `If my advice  is heeded, it will be the western shore,  and the way to  Minas Tirith,' answered Boromir.  `But I  am not the leader of the Company.'  The others said nothing, and Aragorn looked doubtful and troubled.       `I see that you do not yet know  what to do,' said Celeborn. `It is not  my  part to choose for you; but I will help you as  I  may.  There are  some   ####-among  you who can handle  boats: Legolas, whose folk know  the swift Forest   River; and Boromir of Gondor; and Aragorn the traveller.'       `And  one Hobbit! ' cried Merry. `Not all of us look on  boats as  wild  horses. My people live by the banks of the Brandywine.'       `That is  well,' said Celeborn. `Then I will furnish  your Company with  boats. They must be small and light, for  if you go far  by water, there are  places where you will be forced to  carry them."
