O Light to us that wander here       Amid the world of woven trees!         Gilthoniel! O Elbereth!       Clear are thy eyes and bright thy breath!       Snow-white! Snow-white! We sing to thee       In a far land beyond the Sea.     ####-     O stars that in the Sunless Year       With shining hand by her were sawn,       In windy fields now bright and clear       We see your silver blossom blown!         O Elbereth! Gilthoniel!       We still remember, we who dwell       In this far land beneath the trees,       Thy starlight on the Western Seas.       The  song  ended.  'These  are High  Elves!  They  spoke  the  name  of  Elbereth!' said Frodo in amazement,  'Few of that fairest folk are ever seen  in the Shire. Not many now remain in Middle-earth,  east  of the  Great Sea.  This is indeed a strange chance!'       The hobbits  sat in shadow  by the wayside. Before long the Elves  came  down the lane towards the valley. They  passed slowly, and the hobbits could  see the starlight glimmering on their hair and  in their  eyes. They bore no   lights,  yet as they walked a  shimmer, like the light of the moon above the  rim of the hills before it rises, seemed to fall about their feet. They were  now silent, and  as the last Elf  passed  he turned  and looked  towards the  hobbits and laughed.       'Hail,  Frodo!' he  cried. 'You  are  abroad  late. Or are  you perhaps  lost?'  Then he called aloud  to the others, and all the company stopped and  gathered round.       'This  is indeed  wonderful!'  they  said. 'Three hobbits in  a wood at  night! We  have not seen  such a thing  since Bilbo went away.  What is  the  meaning of it?'       'The meaning of it, fair people,'  said Frodo, 'is simply that  we seem  to be going the same  way as you are. I like  walking under the stars. But I  would welcome your company.'       'But we have no need of other company, and hobbits are  so  dull,' they  laughed. 'And how do you know that we go the same way as you, for you do  not  know whither we are going?'       'And how do you know my name?' asked Frodo in return.       'We know many things,'  they said. 'We have seen you often before  with  Bilbo, though you may not have seen us.'       'Who are you, and who is your lord?' asked Frodo.   ####-     'I am Gildor,' answered their leader, the Elf who had first hailed him.  'Gildor Inglorion of  the  House  of Finrod. We are Exiles, and most of  our  kindred have long  ago  departed and  we  too are  now only  tarrying here a   while, ere we return  over the Great Sea.  But some  of  our kinsfolk  dwell  still  in peace in Rivendell.  Come now, Frodo, tell us what you  are doing?   For we see that there is some shadow of fear upon you.'       'O Wise  People!' interrupted Pippin eagerly. 'Tell us about  the Black   Riders!'       'Black Riders?' they said  in  low voices. 'Why  do you ask a bout Black   Riders?'       'Because two Black Riders have  overtaken us today,  or one has done so  twice,' said Pippin;  'only a little while ago  he slipped away as you  drew  near.'       The Elves did not answer at  once, but spoke together  softly  in their  own tongue.  At length Gildor turned to the  hobbits. 'We  will not speak of  this here,' he said. 'We think you had  best come now with us. It is not our  custom, but for this time we will lake you on our road, and  you shall lodge  with us tonight, if you  will.'       'O Fair  Folk!  This is good fortune beyond my hope,' said  Pippin. Sam  was speechless.  'I  thank you indeed, Gildor Inglorion,' said Frodo bowing.  'Elen snla lÂ®menn' omentielvo, a star shines on the hour of our meeting,' he  added in the high-elven speech.       'Be careful,  friends!' cried  Gildor laughing. 'Speak no secrets! Here  is  a  scholar in  the  Ancient  Tongue.  Bilbo  was a  good  master.  Hail,  Elf-friend!' he said, bowing to Frodo.  'Come now with your friends and join  our company! You had best walk in the middle so  that you may not stray. You   may be weary before we halt.'       'Why? Where are you going?' asked Frodo.       'For tonight we go to the woods on the hills above Woodhall. It is some  miles, but  you shall have  rest at  the  end of it, and it will shorten your  journey tomorrow.'       They now marched on again in silence, and passed like shadows and faint  lights: for  Elves  (even  more  than hobbits)  could walk when they  wished   without sound or footfall.  Pippin soon began  to feel sleepy, and staggered  once  or twice; but each time a tall Elf at his side  put out  his  arm  and  saved him from a  fall. Sam walked along at Frodo's side, as if in a  dream,  with an expression on his face half of fear and half of astonished  joy.   ####-     The  woods on either side became denser; the trees were now younger and  thicker;  and as the lane went lower, running down into a fold of the hills,  there were many deep brakes of hazel on the rising slopes at either hand."
