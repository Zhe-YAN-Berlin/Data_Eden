'The King of Gondor and Lord  of the Western Lands,' said  Gandalf 'and   he has taken back all his ancient realm. He will ride soon  to his crowning,  but he waits for you.'       'What shall  we  wear?' said Sam; for all he could  see was the old and  tattered clothes that  they  had journeyed  in, lying  folded  on the ground  beside their beds.        'The clothes that you wore on your way  to Mordor,' said Gandalf. 'Even  the orc-rags that you bore in the black land;  Frodo, shall be preserved. No  silks  and linens, nor any armour or heraldry  could be more honourable. But  later I will find some other clothes, perhaps.'       Then he held out his hands to  them, and they  saw that one shone  with  light. 'What have you got there?' Frodo cried. 'Can it be - ? '       'Yes, I  have brought your two treasures.  They  were found on Sam when  you were rescued.  The  Lady Galadriel's gifts: your glass,  Frodo, and your  box, Sam. You will be glad to have these safe again.'       When they were washed and clad, and had eaten a light meal, the Hobbits  followed  Gandalf.  They  stepped out of  the beech-grove in which  they had  lain, and passed on to  a long green  lawn, glowing in sunshine, bordered by  stately dark-leaved trees laden with scarlet blossom. Behind them they could   hear the  sound of falling water, and a stream  ran down before them between  flowering banks, until it came to a greenwood at the lawn's foot and  passed  then on under an archway of trees, through  which they saw  the  shimmer  of  water far away.       As they  came  to the opening in the wood, they were surprised  to  see  knights in bright mail and tall  guards in silver and black  standing there,  who greeted them with honour and bowed before them. And then one blew a  long  trumpet, and  they  went on through the  aisle of trees  beside  the singing  stream. So they came  to  a wide green land, and beyond it was a broad river   in a silver haze, out of which rose  a  long wooded isle, and many ships lay  by its shores. But on the field where they now stood  a great host was drawn  up,  in  ranks  and  companies glittering  in  the  sun.  And as the Hobbits   ####-approached swords were  unsheathed, and  spears  were  shaken, and horns and  trumpets sang, and men cried with many voices and in many tongues:        'Long live the Halflings! Praise them with great praise!       Cuio i Pheriain anann! Aglar'ni Pheriannath!       Praise them with great praise, Frodo and Samwise!       Daur a Berhael, Conin en Annyn! Eglerio!       Praise them!       Eglerio!       A laita te, laita te! Andave laituvalmet!       Praise them!       Cormacolindor, a laita tbrienna!       Praise them! The Ring-bearers, praise them with great praise!'        And  so the  red blood blushing in their faces  and their eyes  shining  with wonder, Frodo  and Sam went forward  and saw  that amidst the  clamorous  host were set three high-seats  built of green turves. Behind the seat  upon  the right floated, white on green, a great horse running free; upon the left   was a banner, silver upon  blue, a ship swan-prowed faring on  the sea;  but  behind the highest throne in the midst of all a great standard was spread in  the  breeze,  and there a white  tree flowered upon a sable  field beneath a   shining crown and seven glittering stars. On the throne sat a mail-clad man,  a great sword was laid  across his knees, but he wore no  helm. As they drew  near he rose. And then they knew him, changed as he was, so high and glad of  face, kingly, lord of Men, dark-haired with eyes of grey.       Frodo  ran to meet  him, and Sam  followed close behind. 'Well, if that  isn't the crown of all!' he said. 'Strider, or I'm still asleep!'       'Yes, Sam, Strider,'  said Aragorn. 'It is a long way, is  it not, from  Bree, where you did not like the look of me? A long way for us all but yours  has been the darkest road.'       And then to Sam's surprise and utter confusion he bowed his knee before  them; and taking them by the hand,  Frodo upon  his  right and Sam upon  his  left, he led them to the throne, and  setting them upon it, he turned to the  men and captains who stood by and spoke, so that his voice rang over all the  host, crying:       'Praise them with great praise!'       And  when  the glad shout had swelled up and died away  again, to Sam's  final and  complete satisfaction  and pure joy, a  minstrel of Gondor  stood   ####-forth, and knelt, and begged leave to sing. And behold! he said:       'Lo! lords and knights and  men of valour unashamed, kings and princes,   and fair people of Gondor, and Riders of Rohan,  and ye sons of  Elrond, and  DÂ®nedain  of the North, and Elf and Dwarf, and greathearts of the Shire, and  all free folk of the West, now  listen to my lay. For  I will sing to you of  Frodo of the Nine Fingers and the Ring of Doom."
