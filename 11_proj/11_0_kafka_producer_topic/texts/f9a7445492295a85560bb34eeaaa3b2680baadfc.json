  "text": "  \"He is a liar, O truly tremendous one!\" said one of the drivers. \"Several of our  people  were  struck  by  lightning  in  the  cave,  when  we  invited  these  creatures  to  come  below;  and  they  are  as  dead  as  stones. Also  he  has  not  explained  this!\" He   ####-held out the sword which Thorin had worn, the sword which came from the Trolls'  lair.   The Great Goblin gave a truly awful howl of rage when he looked at it, and all  his soldiers gnashed their teeth, clashed their shields, and stamped. They knew the  sword at once.  It had killed hundreds of goblins  in  its  time, when  the  fair elves of  Gondolin hunted them in the hills or did battle before their walls. They had called  it Orcrist, Goblin-cleaver, but the goblins called it simply Biter. They hated it and  hated worse any one that carried it.  \"Murderers'  and  elf-friends!\"  the  Great  Goblin  shouted.  \"Slash  them!  Beat  them! Bite  them! Gnash  them! Take  them  away  to  dark  holes  full  of  snakes,  and  never  let  them  see  the  light  again!\" He was  in  such  a  rage  that he  jumped off his  seat and himself rushed at Thorin with his mouth open.  Just  at  that  moment  all  the  lights  in  the  cavern  went  out,  and  the  great  fire  went  off  poof!  into  a  tower  of  blue  glowing  smoke,  right  up  to  the  roof,  that  scattered piercing white sparks all among the goblins.  The  yells  and  yammering,  croaking,  jibbering  and  jabbering;  howls,  growls  and curses; shrieking and skriking, that followed were beyond description. Several  hundred wild  cats  and wolves being  roasted  slowly  alive  together would not have  compared  with  it.  The  sparks  were  burning  holes  in  the  goblins,  and  the  smoke  that  now  fell  from  the  roof  made  the  air  too  thick  for  even  their  eyes  to  see  through. Soon they were falling over one another and rolling in heaps on the floor,  biting and kicking and fighting as if they had all gone mad.  Suddenly  a  sword  flashed  in  its  own  light.  Bilbo  saw  it  go  right  through  the  Great Goblin as he stood dumbfounded in the middle of his rage. He fell dead, and  the goblin soldiers fled before the sword shrieking into the darkness.  The  sword  went  back  into  its  sheath.  \"Follow  me  quick!\"  said  a  voice  fierce  and  quiet;  and  before Bilbo  understood what  had  happened  he was  trotting  along  again, as fast as he could trot, at the end of the line, down more dark passages with  the  yells  of  the  goblin-hall  growing  fainter  behind  him.  A  pale  light  was  leading  them on.  \"Quicker, quicker!\" said the voice. \"The torches will soon be relit.\"  \"Half  a  minute!\"  said  Dori,  who  was  at  the  back  next  to  Bilbo,  and  a  decent  fellow.  He  made  the  hobbit  scramble  on  his  shoulders  as  best  he  could  with  his  tied  hands,  and  then  off  they  all  went  at  a  run,  with  a  clink-clink  of  chains,  and  many a stumble, since they had no hands to steady themselves with. Not for a long  while did  they  stop,  and by  that  time  they must have been  right down  in  the very  mountain's heart.   ####-Then  Gandalf  lit  up  his  wand.  Of  course  it  was  Gandalf;  but  just  then  they  were  too busy  to ask how he got  there. He  took out his  sword again, and again  it  flashed  in  the  dark  by  itself.  It  burned  with  a  rage  that  made  it  gleam  if  goblins  were  about; now  it was bright  as blue  flame  for delight  in  the killing of  the great  lord of the cave. It made no trouble whatever of cutting through the goblin-chains  and  setting  all  the  prisoners  free  as  quickly  as  possible.  This  sword's  name  was  Glamdring  the  Foe-hammer,  if  you  remember.  The  goblins  just  called  it  Beater,  and hated it worse than Biter if possible. Orcrist, too, had been saved; for Gandalf  had brought it along as well, snatching it from one of the terrified guards. Gandalf  thought of most things; and though he could not do everything, he could do a great  deal for friends in a tight comer.   \"Are we all here?\" said he, handing his sword back to Thorin with a bow. \"Let  me see: one-that's Thorin; two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven;  where  are  Fili  and  Kili?  Here  they  are,  twelve,  thirteen-and  here's Mr.  Baggins:  fourteen!  Well,  well!  it  might  be  worse,  and  then  again  it  might  be  a  good  deal  better. No ponies, and no food, and no knowing quite where we are, and hordes of  angry goblins just behind! On we go!\"  On  they  went.  Gandalf  was  quite  right:  they  began  to  hear  goblin  noises  and  horrible cries far behind in the passages they had come through. That sent them on  faster  than  ever,  and  as  poor Bilbo  could  not  possibly  go  half  as  fast-for dwarves  can roll along at a tremendous pace, I can tell you, when they have to-they took it  in turn to carry him on their backs.  Still  goblins  go  faster  than  dwarves,  and  these  goblins  knew  the  way  better  (they had made the paths themselves), and were madly angry; so that do what they  could  the  dwarves  heard  the  cries  and  howls  getting  closer  and  closer."
