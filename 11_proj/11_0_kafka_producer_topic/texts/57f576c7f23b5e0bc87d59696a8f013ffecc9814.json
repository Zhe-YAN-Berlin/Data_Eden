The   third was taller than  the others: his hair  was long and gleaming and  on his  helm was  a crown.  In one hand he held a   long sword, and in the other a knife;  both the knife and the hand that held  it glowed with a pale light. He sprang forward and bore down on Frodo.       At that moment Frodo threw himself forward on  the ground, and he heard  himself crying aloud: O  Elbereth! Gilthoniel! At the same time he struck at  the feet of his enemy. A shrill  cry rang  out in the night;  and he felt  a   pain  like  a  dart  of  poisoned ice  pierce his left shoulder. Even  as he  swooned he caught, as through a swirling mist,  a glimpse of Strider leaping   ####-out of the darkness with a flaming brand of wood in either hand. With a last   effort Frodo,  dropping  his sword, slipped  the Ring from  his  finger  and  closed his right hand tight upon it.     ####-   Chapter 12. Flight to the Ford            When Frodo came to himself he was still clutching the Ring desperately.   He was lying by the fire, which was now piled high and burning br ightly. His  three companions were bending  over  him.  'What has happened? Where is  the  pale  king?' he  asked wildly. They were too overjoyed to  hear him speak to   answer  for  a  while; nor did they  understand  his question.  At length he  gathered from  Sam that they had seen nothing  but the vague shadowy  shapes  coming towards them.  Suddenly to his  horror Sam found  that his master had  vanished; and at that moment a black shadow rushed past him, and he fell. He  heard  Frodo's  voice, but it seemed to  come from a great distance, or from  under the earth, crying out strange words. They saw nothing more, until they   stumbled over the body of Frodo, lying as  if  dead,  face downwards  on the  grass  with his sword  beneath  him. Strider ordered them to pick him up and  lay  him near the fire, and then he disappeared. That was now  a  good while  ago.       Sam plainly was beginning to have doubts again about Strider; but while   they were talking he returned, appearing suddenly out  of the  shadows. They  started, and Sam drew his sword and stood over Frodo; but Strider knelt down  swiftly at his side.       'I  am not a Black  Rider,  Sam,' he said  gently, 'nor in league  with  them. I  have been  trying to discover  something of  their movements; but I  have  found nothing. I cannot  think  why  they have gone and do  not attack   again. But there is no feeling of their presence anywhere at hand.'       When he heard what Frodo had  to tell, he became full  of concern,  and  shook his head  and sighed. Then he ordered Pippin and Merry to heat as much  water as they could in their small kettles, and to bathe the wound with  it.  'Keep the fire going well, and keep Frodo warm!' he said. Then he got up and  walked  away, and called  Sam to him.  'I think I  understand  things better  now,' he said in  a low voice.  'There  seem only to  have  been five of the  enemy. Why they were not all here,  I  don't know;  but I  don't  think they  expected to  be resisted.  They have drawn off for the  time being. But  not  far,  I fear. They will come again another night, if we cannot escape.  They  are  only  waiting,  because  they  think  that   their  purpose  is  almost   accomplished, and that the  Ring  cannot fly much further. I fear, Sam, that   ####-they believe  your  master has a deadly  wound that will subdue him to their   will. We  shall see!' Sam choked with tears. 'Don't  despair!' said Strider.  'You  must trust  me  now. Your  Frodo is made of sterner  stuff  than I had  guessed, though Gandalf  hinted that it might prove so. He is not slain, and  I think he will  resist the evil power of the wound longer  than his enemies  expect. I will do all I can to help and heal him. Guard him well, while I am  away!' He hurried off and disappeared again into the darkness.       Frodo  dozed, though the  pain  of his wound was slowly growing,  and a   deadly  chill  was spreading  from  his  shoulder to  his arm  and side. His  friends watched  over him, warming him,  and bathing  his  wound.  The night  passed  slowly  and wearily.  Dawn was growing in the sky, and the  dell was  filling with grey light, when Strider at last returned.       'Look!' he cried; and stooping he lifted from the  ground a black cloak  that had lain there hidden by the darkness. A foot above the lower hem there  was a slash. 'This was  the stroke of Frodo's sword,' he said. 'The only hurt  that it did to his enemy, I fear; for it is unharmed, but  all blades perish  that pierce  that  dreadful  King.  More  deadly  to  him  was  the name  of  Elbereth.'       'And  more  deadly to Frodo was this!' He stooped again and lifted up a   long thin knife. There was a cold gleam in it. As Strider raised it they saw  that near the end  its edge was notched and  the  point was broken  off."
