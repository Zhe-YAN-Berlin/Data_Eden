When Summer lies upon the world, and in a noon of gold        Beneath the roof of sleeping leaves the dreams of trees unfold;       When woodland halls are green and cool, and wind is in the West,       Come back to me! Come back to me, and say my land is best!         entwife.       When Summer warms the hanging fruit and burns the berry brown;       When straw is gold, and ear is white, and harvest comes to town ;       When honey spills, and apple swells, though wind be in the West,       I'll linger here beneath the Sun, because my land is best!     ####-     ent.       When Winter comes, the winter wild that hill and wood shall slay;       When trees shall fall and starless night devour the sunless day;       When wind is in the deadly East, then in the bitter rain        I'll look for thee, and call to thee; I'll come to thee again!         entwife.       When Winter comes, and singing ends; when darkness falls at last;       When broken is the barren bough, and light and labour past;       I'll look for thee, and wait for thee, until we meet again:       Together we will take the road beneath the bitter rain!         both.       Together we will take the road that leads into the West,       And far away will find a land where both our hearts may rest.'         Treebeard ended  his song.  'That  is  how it goes,'  he  said.  'It is  Elvish, of course: lighthearted, quickworded, and soon over. I daresay it is  fair  enough. But the Ents could say  more on their side,  if they had time!  But now I am going to stand  up  and  take  a little sleep.  Where  will you   stand?'       'We usually  lie down to  sleep,' said Merry.  'We  shall  be all right  where we are.'       'Lie down to sleep!' said Treebeard. 'Why of course you do! Hm, hoom: I   was  forgetting:  singing that song  put  me in mind  of  old times;  almost   thought that I was talking to young Entings, I did. Well, you can lie on the  bed. I am going to stand in the rain. Good night!'       Merry  and Pippin climbed on to the bed and curled up in the soft grass  and fern. It was fresh,  and sweet-scented, and warm. The lights died  down,  and the glow of the trees faded; but outside  under  the arch they could see  old Treebeard standing, motionless, with his arms raised above his head. The  bright stars peered out of the sky, and lit the falling water as  it spilled  on to his fingers  and head,  and  dripped, dripped, in  hundreds  of silver  drops on to  his  feet. Listening to the tinkling of  the drops  the hobbits  fell asleep.       They  woke to find a cool sun  shining into the great court, and on  to  the floor of the bay. Shreds of high cloud were overhead, running on a stiff   ####-easterly wind. Treebeard was not to be seen; but while Merry and Pippin were  bathing in the basin by the arch, they heard him humming and  singing, as he  came up the path between the trees.        'Hoo, ho! Good morning, Merry and Pippin!' he boomed, when he saw  them.  'You  sleep long. I have  been many a hundred  strides already today. Now we  will have a drink, and go to Entmoot.'       He  poured  them  out two  full bowls  from a  stone  jar;  but  from a   different jar. The taste was not the same  as it  had been the night before:  it was earthier and  richer, more sustaining and  food-like,  so  to  speak.  While the hobbits drank, sitting on the edge of  the bed, and nibbling small  pieces of elf-cake (more because they felt that eating was a  necessary part  of breakfast than  because they  felt  hungry), Treebeard stood,  humming in  Entish or Elvish or some strange tongue, and looking up at the sky.       'Where is Entmoot?' Pippin ventured to ask.       'Hoo, eh? Entmoot?' said Treebeard, turning round. 'It is not a  place,  it  is a  gathering of Ents  --  which does not often happen nowadays.  But I  have  managed  to make a fair number  promise to come.  We shall meet in the  place  where we have always met: Derndingle  Men  call it.  It is away south  from here. We must be there before noon.'       Before long they set off. Treebeard carried the  hobbits in his arms as  on the previous day. At  the entrance to  the court he turned  to the right,  stepped over the stream, and strode away southwards along  the feet of great  tumbled slopes where trees were scanty. Above these the hobbits saw thickets  of birch and rowan, and beyond them dark climbing pinewoods.  Soon  Treebeard  turned a little away from the hills and plunged into deep groves,  where the  trees were  larger, taller, and  thicker  than any that the hobbits had ever  seen before. For a  while they felt faintly the sense of stifling which they  had  noticed when  they  first ventured into Fangorn,  but it  soon  passed."
