The old man took no notice,  but stooped and sat himself on  a low flat  stone. Then  his grey cloak  drew apart, and they saw, beyond doubt, that he  was clothed beneath all in white.       'Saruman!' cried Gimli, springing towards him with axe in hand. 'speak!  Tell  us where you have  hidden  our friends! What  have you done with them?   Speak, or  I will  make a dint in your hat that even  a wizard will find  it  hard to deal with!'       The old  man was too quick for him. He sprang to his feet and leaped to  the top of a large rock. There he stood, grown suddenly tall, towering above  them. His hood and his grey rags were flung away. His  white garments shone.  He  lifted up  his staff, and  Gimli's axe leaped from his  grasp  and  fell  ringing on the ground. The sword of Aragorn,  stiff in his motionless  hand,  blazed with a sudden fire. Legolas gave a great shout and shot an arrow high   into the air: it vanished in a flash of flame.       'Mithrandir!' he cried. 'Mithrandir!'       'Well met, I say to you again. Legolas!' said the old man.       They all gazed at him. His hair was white as snow in  the sunshine; and  gleaming  white  was his robe;  the eyes under  his deep  brows were bright,   piercing as the rays of the sun; power was in his hand. Between wonder, joy,   and fear they stood and found no words to say.       At  last  Aragorn stirred.  'Gandalf!'  he said.  'Beyond all hope  you   return to us in our  need! What veil was over my sight? Gandalf!' Gimli said   nothing, hut sank to his knees, shading his eyes.        'Gandalf,' the old man repeated, as if recalling from old memory a long  disused word. 'Yes, that was the name. I was Gandalf.'       He stepped down from the rock, and picking up his grey cloak wrapped it   about him: it seemed as if  the  sun had been  shining, but now was  hid  in  cloud again.  'Yes, you may  still call me Gandalf,'  he said, and the voice  was the  voice  of their old friend  and guide. 'Get  up, my  good Gimli! No  blame to  you, and no harm done to  me. Indeed my friends,  none of you have  any weapon that could  hurt me. Be merry! We meet  again. At the turn of the   ####-tide. The great storm is coming, but the tide has turned.'       He laid  his hand on  Gimli's head, and the Dwarf looked up and laughed  suddenly. 'Gandalf!' he said. 'But you are all in white!'       'Yes, I am white  now,' said Gandalf.  'Indeed I am  Saruman, one might  almost  say,  Saruman  as  he  should have  been. But come  now, tell me  of  yourselves! I  have passed through fire and  deep water,  since we parted. I  have forgotten much that I thought I knew, and learned again much that I had  forgotten. I can see  many things far off, but many things that are close at  hand I cannot see. Tell me of yourselves!'       'What do  you wish to know?' said Aragorn. 'All that has happened since  we parted on  the bridge would be a long tale.  Will you  not first give  us  news of the hobbits? Did you find them, and are they safe?'       'No, I did not find them,' said Gandalf. 'There was a darkness over the  valleys of the  Emyn Muil, and I did not know  of their captivity, until the  eagle told me.'       'The eagle!' said  Legolas. 'I have seen an eagle high and far off: the  last time was three days ago, above the Emyn Muil.'       'Yes,'  said Gandalf,  'that  was Gwaihir the Windlord,  who rescued me  from Orthanc.  I sent him before me to watch the River and  gather  tidings.  His sight is keen, but he cannot see all  that passes under hill  and  tree.  Some things he has  seen, and  others I  have seen myself.  The Ring now has  passed beyond my help, or  the help of any of  the Company that set out from  Rivendell. Very nearly it was revealed to  the Enemy, but it escaped.  I had  some part in that: for I sat  in a  high place, and I strove  with the  Dark  Tower; and  the Shadow passed. Then  I  was weary, very weary; and I  walked  long in dark thought.'       'Then you know about Frodo!' said Gimli. 'How do things go with him?'       'I cannot say. He was saved from a great peril, but many lie before him  still. He resolved to go alone to Mordor, and he set out: that is all that I  can say.'       'Not alone,' said Legolas. 'We think that Sam went with him.'       'Did he!' said Gandalf, and there was a gleam in his eye and a smile on  his face. 'Did  he indeed? It is news to  me, yet  it does not  surprise me.  Good! Very good! You lighten  my heart. You must tell me more. Now sit by  me  and tell me the tale of your journey.'       The companions  sat on the ground at his  feet, and Aragorn took up the   ####-tale. For a long  while Gandalf said nothing, and he asked no quest ions. His  hands were  spread upon his knees, and his eyes  were closed. At  last  when  Aragorn spoke of the death of Boromir and of his last journey upon the Great  River, the old man sighed."
