But you can at least tell us, Frodo, whether you think   his guess good or bad.'       'I think,'  answered Frodo slowly, 'that it was a good guess, as  far as  it  goes. There is a  connexion with Bilbo's  old adventures,  and the Riders  are looking,  or perhaps one  ought to say  searching,  for him or for me. I  also fear, if you want to know, that it is no joke at all; and that I am not  safe here or anywhere else.' He looked round at the windows and walls, as if  he was afraid  they would  su ddenly give  way.  The others looked at him  in  silence, and exchanged meaning glances among themselves.       'It's coming out in a minute,' whispered Pippin to Merry. Merry nodded.       'Well!' said Frodo at  last, sitting  up and straightening his back, as  if he had made  a  decision.  'I can't keep it dark any  longer.  I have got  something to tell you all. But I don't know quite how to begin.'       'I think I could help you,' said Merry quietly, 'by telling you some of  it myself.'       'What do you mean?' said  Frodo, looking  at him anxiously. 'Just this,  my  dear old  Frodo: you  are miserable, because you don't know how  to  say  good-bye.  You  meant to leave the Shire, of course. But danger has come  on  you sooner  than you expected, and now you are  making up your mind to go at  once. And you don't want to. We are very sorry for you.'       Frodo opened his mouth  and shut it again. His  look of surprise was so   ####-comical that they laughed. 'Dear  old  Frodo!' said Pippin.  'Did you really  think you had thrown dust in  all our eyes? You have not been nearly careful  or clever enough for that! You have obviously been planning to go and saying  farewell  to  all your haunts all this  year since April. We have constantly  heard you  muttering:  \"Shall  I  ever   look  down into that valley again, I  wonder\",  and things like that.  And pretending that you had come to the end   of  your  money,  and  actually  selling  your  beloved  Bag  End  to  those  Sackville-Bagginses! And all those close talks with Gandalf.'       'Good  heavens!'  said Frodo. 'I thought  I had been  both  careful and  clever. I don't know what Gandalf would say. Is all  the Shire discussing my   departure then?'       'Oh no!' said Merry. 'Don't worry about that! The secret won't keep for   long,  of  course;  but  at  present it  is,  I  think,  only  known  to  us  conspirators. After  all, you must remember  that we know you  well, and are  often with  you.  We can usually guess what you are thinking. I  knew Bilbo,   too. To  tell you the truth,  I had been watching you  rather  closely  ever   since he  left. I thought you would go  after him sooner or  later; indeed I  expected you  to go sooner, and lately we have  been very  anxious.  We have  been terrified that you might give us the slip, and go off suddenly,  all on  your own like he did. Ever since this spring we have kept our eyes open, and   done a good deal of planning on our own account. You are not going to escape  so easily!'       'But I must go,' said Frodo. 'It cannot be helped, dear friends. It  is  wretched for us all, but it is no use your trying to keep me. Since you have  guessed so much, please help me and do not hinder me!'       'You  do not understand!' said Pippin. 'You  must go  - and therefore we  must, too. Merry and I are coming with you. Sam is an excellent fellow,  and  would jump down a dragon's throat to  save you, if he did not trip over  his  own feet; but  you  will  need  more than one  companion in  your  dangerous  adventure.'       'My dear  and  most beloved hobbits!'  said Frodo deeply  moved. 'But I  could not  allow it. I decided that  long ago, too. You speak of danger, but  you do not understand. This is no treasure-hunt,  no there-and -back journey.   I am flying from deadly peril into deadly peril.'       'Of course  we understand,'  said Merry  firmly.  'That is why we  have  decided to come. We know the Ring is no laughing-matter; but we are going to  do our best to help you against the Enemy.'   ####-     'The Ring!' said Frodo, now completely amazed.       'Yes, the Ring,' said  Merry. 'My dear old hobbit, you don't  allow for   the inquisitiveness of friends. I have known about the existence of the Ring  for years  - before Bilbo went away, in fact; but since he obviously regarded  it  as  secret,  I  kept  the  knowledge  in  my  head, until we formed  our  conspiracy. I  did not know Bilbo, of course, as  well as I know you; I  was  too young, and he was also more careful  - but  he was not careful enough. If  you want to know how I first found out, I will tell you.'       'Go on!' said Frodo faintly.       'It was  the  Sackville-Bagginses that were his downfall,  as you might  expect. One day, a year before the Party, I happened to be walking along the   road, when I  saw Bilbo ahead."
