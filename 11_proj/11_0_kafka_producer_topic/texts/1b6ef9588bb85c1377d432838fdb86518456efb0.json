'You  will  get plenty  when  the time  comes.' Then he disappeared inside with Bilbo, and the door  was  shut.  The  young  hobbits  stared at  the door  in vain for a while, and then made off,   ####-feeling that the day of the party would never come.       Inside Bag End, Bilbo and Gandalf were sitting at the open window  of a   small room looking out west on to the garden.  The late afternoon was br ight   and   peaceful.  The  flowers  glowed   red  and  golden:  snap-dragons  and  sun-flowers, and nasturtiums trailing all over the turf walls and peeping in  at the round windows.        'How bright your garden looks!' said Gandalf.       'Yes,' said Bilbo. I am very fond indeed of it, and of all the dear old  Shire; but I think I need a holiday.'       'You mean to go on with your plan then?'       'I do. I made up my mind months ago, and I haven't changed it.'       'Very  well.  It is no good saying any  more.  Stick to your plan  - your  whole plan, mind  - and I hope it will turn out for the best, for  you,  and  for all of us.'       'I hope  so.  Anyway  I mean to enjoy  myself on Thursday, and  have my  little joke.'       'Who will laugh, I wonder?' said Gandalf, shaking his head.       'We shall see,' said Bilbo.       The next day more carts rolled up the Hill, and still more carts. There  might have  been  some grumbling about 'dealing locally', but that very week  orders began to pour out of Bag End for every  kind of provision, commodity,  or luxury  that  could be obtained in Hobbiton or Bywater or anywhere in the  neighbourhood.  People  became enthusiastic; and they began to tick off  the  days on  the calendar; and they watched eagerly for the  postman, hoping for   invitations.        Before long  the  invitations  began  pouring  out,  and  the  Hobbiton  post-office  was blocked, and the Bywater post -office  was snowed under, and  voluntary assistant postmen were called for.  There was a constant stream of  them going up the Hill, carrying hundreds of polite variations on Thank you,  I shall certainly come.       A notice appeared on the gate at Bag End: NO ADMITTANCE EXCEPT  ON PARTY  BUSINESS. Even those  who had, or  pretended  to  have  Party  Business were  seldom allowed inside. Bilbo  was  busy:  writing invitations,  ticking  off  answers, packing up presents, and making  some  private preparations  of his  own. From the time of Gandalf's arrival he remained hidden from view.        One morning the hobbits woke to find  the large field,  south of Bilbo's   ####-front door, covered with ropes and poles for tents  and pavilions. A special  entrance  was cut into the bank leading to  the road, and wide steps  and  a   large white gate were built there. The three hobbit-families of Bagshot Row,   adjoining the field, were intensely  interested  and  generally envied.  Old  Gaffer Gamgee stopped even pretending to work in his garden.       The tents began to  go up. There was a specially large pavilion, so big  that the tree that grew in the   field was right inside it, and stood proudly  near one end, at the head of  the chief table. Lanterns were hung on all its  branches. More  promising still (to the hobbits' mind): an enormous open-air   kitchen was erected in the  north corner of  the field. A draught  of cooks,  from every inn and eating-house  for miles around, arrived to supplement the  dwarves and other odd  folk  that were quartered at Bag End. Excitement rose  to its height.       Then the weather  clouded  over.  That was on Wednesday the  eve of the   Party.  Anxiety was  intense. Then Thursday,  September  the 22nd,  actually  dawned. The sun got up, the clouds vanished, flags were unfurled and the fun  began.       Bilbo  Baggins called it  a  party,  but it  was really  a  variety  of  entertainments  rolled  into one.  Practically  everybody  living  near  was  invited. A very few were overlooked  by accident, but  as they turned up all  the same, that did not matter.  Many people  from other parts of  the  Shire  were also asked; and there were even  a few from outside the  borders. Bilbo   met the guests (and additions) at the new white gate in person. He gave away  presents to all and sundry - the latter were  those  who went out again by a   back way  and came  in  again by  the gate. Hobbits give   presents  to other   people  on their own birthdays. Not very expensive ones, as a  rule, and not  so lavishly  as on this  occasion; but it was  not a bad system. Actually in  Hobbiton  and Bywater every  day in the year it was somebody's  birthday, so  that every  hobbit  in those parts had a fair chance of at least one present  at least once a week. But they never got tired of them.       On this occasion the presents were unusually  good. The hobbit-children  were so excited that for a while they almost forgot  about eating."
