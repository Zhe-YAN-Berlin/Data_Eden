The last arrow of Legolas kindled in  the air  as it flew, and  plunged burning into the  heart of a  great wolf-chieftain.  All the others fled.       Slowly the fire died till nothing was left but falling ash  and sparks;   a bitter smoke curled above the burned tree-stumps, and blew darkly from the  hill, as the first  light of dawn came dimly in the  sky. Their enemies were  routed and did not return.       `What did I  tell  you,  Mr. Pippin?  ' said Sam, she/thing his  sword.  `Wolves won't get him. That was an eye-opener, and no mistake! Nearly singed  the hair off my head!'       When  the full light of the morning came no signs of the wolves were to  be found, and they  looked in vain for the  bodies of the  dead. No trace of  the fight remained but the  charred trees and the arrows of Legolas lying on  the hill-top. All were undamaged save one of which only the point was left.       `It is as  I feared,'  said Gandalf.  `These  were no  ordinary  wolves  hunting for food in the wilderness. Let us eat quickly and go!'       That day  the weather changed again, almost as if it was at the command   of some power that had no longer  any use for snow, since they had retreated  from the pass, a power that wished now to have a clear light in  which things  that  moved  in the  wild could be  seen from far away.  The  wind  had been  turning through north to north-west during the night, and now it failed. The  clouds  vanished southwards and the sky was opened, high and blue.  As  they  stood upon the hill-side, ready to depart, a pale sunlight gleamed over  the  mountain-tops.        `We must reach  the doors before sunset,' said Gandalf,  'or I  fear we  shall not reach them at all. It is not far, but our path may be winding, for   here Aragorn cannot guide us; he has seldom walked in this country, and only  once have I been under the west wall of Moria, and that was long ago.       `There  it lies,' he said,  pointing away south-eastwards to where  the  mountains' sides fell sheer into the shadows at their feet.  In the distance  could  be dimly seen a line of bare cliffs,  and in their midst, taller than  the rest, one great grey wall. `When we left the pass I  led you southwards,   and not  back to  our starting point, as some of you may have noticed. It is   ####-well that I  did so, for now we have several miles less to cross, and  haste  is needed. Let us go! '       `I do not know which to hope,' said  Boromir grimly: `that Gandalf will  find what he seeks, or that coming to the cliff we shall find the gates lost  for ever. All choices seem ill, and to be caught between wolves and the wall   the likeliest chance. Lead on!'       Gimli now walked ahead by the wizard's side, so eager was he to come to  Moria. Together they led  the Company back towards the  mountains. The  only  road of old  to Moria from the  west  had lain along the course of a stream,  the Sirannon,  that ran out from the feet of the cliffs near where the doors  had stood.  But either Gandalf was astray,  or  else the land had changed in  recent years; for he  did not strike the stream where he  looked to  find it,  only a few miles southwards from their start.       The morning was  passing towards noon,  and still the  Company wandered  and scrambled in a barren country  of red stones. Nowhere could they see any  gleam of  water or hear any sound of it. All was bleak and dry. Their hearts  sank.  They saw no living thing, and not a bird was in the sky; but what the  night  would bring, if it caught them in that  lost land, none of them cared  to think.       Suddenly Gimli, who  had pressed on ahead, called back  to them. He was  standing  on a knoll and pointing to the  right. Hurrying up they saw  below  them  a  deep and narrow channel. It was  empty and  silent,  and  hardly  a   trickle of water flowed among the  brown and red-stained  stones of its bed;   but  on the  near side there was a path, much broken and decayed, that wound  its way among the ruined walls and paving -stones of an ancient highroad.       'Ah! Here it is at last! ' said Gandalf. `This is where the stream ran:  Sirannon, the  Gate-stream, they used  to call  it. But what has happened to  the water,  I cannot guess; it used  to  be swift  and noisy.  Come! We must   hurry on. We are late.'       The Company were  footsore and tired; but they  trudged  doggedly along  the rough and winding track for many miles. The sun turned from the noon and  began  to go west. After  a brief halt  and a hasty meal they went on again.  Before them the  mountains frowned, but  their path lay in a deep  trough of  land  and  they  could  see only  the higher shoulders and the  far eastward  peaks.       At length they came  to a sharp  bend. There  the road, which had  been  veering southwards between the brink of the channel and  a steep fall of the   ####-land to the left, turned and went due east again."
