For   one thing, there was a lot to do up in the Bag End garden, and he would have  a busy day tomorrow, if the weather cleared. The grass was growing fast. But  Sam ha d more on his mind than gardening. After a while he sighed, and got up  and went out.       It was  early April and the sky was now clearing after  heavy rain. The  sun was down,  and  a cool  pale evening was quietly fading  into night.  He  walked  home  under  the  early stars  through  Hobbiton and  up  the  Hill,  whistling softly and thoughtfully.       It  was  just at  this  time that  Gandalf  reappeared  after his  long  absence. For three years  after  the Party he had  been away.  Then he  paid  Frodo a  brief visit,  and after taking a good look at him he went off again.  During  the  next  year  or  two  he  had  turned  up  fairly often,  coming  unexpectedly  after  dusk, and going off without warning before sunrise.  He  would  not  discuss  his  own  business  and  journeys, and  seemed  chiefly  interested in small news about Frodo's health and doings.       Then suddenly his visits had ceased. It was over nine years since Frodo  had seen or heard of him, and  he had begun  to think that  the wizard would  never return and  had given up all interest in hobbits. But that evening, as  Sam was walking home  and twilight was fading, there came the once  familiar  tap on the study window.        Frodo welcomed  his old friend with  surprise  and great delight.  They  looked hard at one another.       'Ah well eh?' said Gandalf. 'You look the same as ever, Frodo!'       'So do you,' Frodo replied; but secretly he thought that Gandalf looked  older and  more careworn. He pressed him for news of himself and of the wide  world, and  soon they were  deep in talk, and  they stayed  up far into  the  night.       Next morning after a late breakfast, the  wizard was sitting with Frodo  by the open  window of the  study. A bright fire was on the hearth,  but the  sun was warm, and  the  wind was in the  South. Everything looked fresh, and  the new green of Spring  was shimmering in the fields and on the tips of the   trees' fingers.        Gandalf  was thinking of  a  spring,  nearly  eighty years before, when  Bilbo  had run out  of Bag End without  a handkerchief. His hair was perhaps   ####-whiter  than it  had  been  then,  and his  beard  and eyebrows were perhaps  longer, and  his face more lined with care and  wisdom; but his eyes were as  bright as ever, and he smoked and blew smoke-rings with the same vigour  and  delight.       He was  smoking  now in  silence, for  Frodo was sitting still, deep in  thought. Even in the light of morning he felt the dark shadow of the tidings  that Gandalf had brought. At last he broke the silence.       'Last  night  you  began to  tell  me  strange  things  about  my ring,  Gandalf,' he said. 'And then you stopped, because you said that such matters  were best left until  daylight. Don't you think  you  had better finish now?   You  say the ring  is dangerous,  far mor e  dangerous than  I guess. In what  way?'       'In many  ways,' answered  the wizard. It is far  more powerful than  I  ever dared to think at first, so powerful that in the  end it  would utterly  overcome anyone of mortal race who possessed it. It would possess him.       'In Eregion long  ago many Elven-rings  were made,  magic  rings as you   call them, and they were, of course, of various  kinds: some more potent and  some  less.  The lesser rings were only essays  in the craft before  it  was  full-grown, and to the Elven-smiths they were but  trifles  - yet still to my  mind dangerous for mortals. But  the Great Rings,  the Rings of Power,  they  were perilous.        'A  mortal, Frodo, who keeps one of the Great  Rings, does not die, but  he does not  grow  or obtain more life, he merely continues, until  at  last  every minute is a weariness. And if he often  uses the Ring  to make himself  invisible,  he fades: he becomes in the end invisible permanently, and walks  in the twilight under the eye of the  dark power that rules the Rings.  Yes,  sooner or  later  - later, if he is strong or well-meaning to begin with, but  neither strength nor good purpose will last  - sooner or later the dark power   will devour him.'       'How terrifying!' said Frodo. There was another long silence. The sound  of Sam Gamgee cutting the lawn came in from the garden.       'How long have you  known this?'  asked Frodo  at length. 'And how much  did Bilbo know?'       'Bilbo knew no  more than he told you, I  am  sure,' said Gandalf.  'He  would certainly never have  passed on  to you anything that he thought would  be a danger, even though I  promised to  look after you. He thought the ring   was very beautiful, and very  useful at  need;  and if anything was wrong or   ####-queer, it was himself. He said that it was \"growing on his mind\", and he was  always worrying about it; but he did not suspect that the ring itself was to  blame."
