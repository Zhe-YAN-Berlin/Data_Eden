  "text": " 'For though  I do  not ask for aid, we need it. It would comfort  us to know that others fought  also with all the means that they have.'       `Then  be comforted,'  said  Elrond.  `For  there are  other powers and  realms that  you know not, and  they are hidden from you.  Anduin  the Great  flows past many shores, ere it comes to Argonath and the Gates of Gondor.'       'Still it might be  well for all,' said Gluin the Dwarf,  'if all these  strengths were joined, and  the powers  of each  were used in  league. Other   rings there may be, less treacherous, that might be  used in  our need.  The  Seven are lost  to us  -- if Balin has not found the ring of Thrur which  was   ####-the last; naught has been heard of it since Thrur  perished in Moria. Indeed  I  may  now reveal that it was partly in  hope to find that  ring that Balin  went away.'       `Balin will find no  ring in  Moria,'  said  Gandalf. `Thrur gave it to  Thrbin his  son,  but not Thrbin to Thorin. It was taken  with  torment from  Thrbin in the dungeons of Dol Guldur. I came too late.'       'Ah, alas!' cried Gluin.  'When will  the day come of our  revenge? But  still there are the Three. What of the Three Rings of the Elves? Very mighty  Rings, it is said. Do not the Elf-lords keep them? Yet they too were made by  the Dark  Lord long ago. Are  they idle? I see Elf-lords here. Will they not  say?'       The  Elves returned  no answer.  `Did you not  hear  me,  Gluin?'  said  Elrond.  `The Three were not made by Sauron, nor did he ever touch them. But  of them it  is not permitted to speak. So much only in this' hour of doubt I  may now say. They are not idle. But they were  not made as weapons of war or   conquest:  that is  not  their power.  Those who  made  them did  not desire  strength or  domination or  hoarded wealth, but understanding,  making,  and  healing,  to preserve  all  things  unstained.  These things  the  Elves  of  Middle-earth have in  some measure gained,  though with sorrow. But all that  has  been wrought  by those who wield the Three will turn  to their undoing,   and their minds and hearts will become revealed to Sauron, if he regains the  One. It would be better if the Three had never been. That is his purpose.'       `But what then would happen, if the Ruling Ring  were  destroyed as you   counsel?' asked Gluin.       'We know not for certain,' answered  Elrond sadly. `Some hope that  the  Three Rings,  which Sauron  has never touched,  would  then become free, and  their  rulers might heal  the  hurts of  the world that he has wrought.  But  maybe  when the One has gone, the Three will fail, and many fair things will  fade and be forgotten. That is my belief.'       `Yet all  the Elves are willing to endure this chance,' said Glorfindel  'if by it the power of Sauron may be broken, and the fear of his dominion be   taken away for ever.'       'Thus we return once more to the destroying of the Ring,' said Erestor,  `and  yet we come  no  nearer. What  strength have we for the finding of the  Fire in which  it was made? That  is  the path of despair. Of folly I  would   say, if the long wisdom of Elrond did not forbid me.'       'Despair, or folly?' said Gandalf.  `It is not  despair, for despair is   ####-only for those who see the end beyond all doubt. We do not.  It is wisdom to  recognize  necessity,  when all  other courses have been  weighed, though as  folly it may appear to those who cling to false hope. Well, let folly be our  cloak, a veil before the eyes of the  Enemy! For he is very wise, and weighs  all  things to a nicety in  the scales  of his malice. But the only  measure  that he knows is desire, desire for power; and so he judges all hearts. Into  his  heart  the thought will not enter that any will refuse it, that  having  the Ring we may seek to destroy it. If we seek this, we shall put him out of  reckoning.'       'At  least  for a while,' said  Elrond. `The road must  be trod, but it  will  be very hard. And neither strength nor  wisdom will  carry us far upon  it. This quest may be attempted by the weak with as much hope as the strong.  Yet such is oft the course of deeds that move the wheels of the world: small   hands do them because they must, while the eyes of the great are elsewhere.'       'Very  well,  very well,  Master Elrond!'  said Bilbo suddenly. 'Say no  more! It  is plain  enough  what you are  pointing at. Bilbo the silly hobbit  started this  affair, and Bilbo had better finish it, or himself. I was very  comfortable here, and getting  on  with my  book.  If you want to know, I am  just  writing  an  ending  for it.  I had   thought of putting: and  he lived  happily ever afterwards  to the end of  his days.  It is a  good ending, and  none the worse for having been used before. Now  I shall have to alter that:  it does not look  like coming true;  and anyway there will evidently have to  be  several  more chapters, if  I live to  write  them.  It  is  a frightful  nuisance."
