  "text": " It   would  probably be impossible ever to  make  him understand  or believe that  Frodo had saved his life in the only way he could. What else could he do? --  to keep faith,  as  near  as might be, with both sides. `Come!' he said. `Or  the Precious will be angry. We are  going back now, up the stream. Go on, go  on, you go in front! '       Gollum crawled along close to the brink for a little way, snuffling and  suspicious. Presently he stopped and raised his head. `Something's  there! '  he  said.  `Not a  hobbit.'  Suddenly  he turned  back.  A  green  light was  flickering in  his  bulging  eyes.  `Masster, masster!'  he hissed. 'Wicked!   Tricksy! False!' He spat and stretched out his long arms with white snapping  fingers.        At that moment the great black shape of Anborn loomed up behind him and  came down  on him. A large strong hand took him in the nape of the neck  and  pinned him. He  twisted round  like lightning,   all wet and slimy as he was,   wriggling like an eel, biting  and  scratching like  a cat. But two more men  came up out of the shadows.       'Hold still!  '  said one. `Or we'll stick  you  as full  of pins as  a    ####-hedgehog. Hold still!'       Gollum  went limp, and began to whine and weep. They tied him, none too  gently.       `Easy, easy! ' said Frodo. `He has no strength to match you. Don't hurt  him, if you can help it. He'll be quieter, if you don't. Smjagol! They won't   hurt you. I'll go with you, and you shall  come to no  harm. Not unless they  kill me too. Trust Master! '       Gollum turned and spat at him. The men picked  him up, put  a hood over   his eyes, and carried him off.       Frodo  followed them, feeling  very wretched.  They  went  through  the  opening behind the bushes. and back, down the stairs  and passages, into the  cave. Two or three  torches  had been lit. Men were stirring. Sam was there,   and he gave a queer look at the limp bundle that the men carried. `Got him?'  he said to Frodo.       'Yes. Well no, I didn't get him. He  came to me, because  he trusted me  at  first, I'm afraid.  I did not want him tied up like this. I hope it will  be all right; but I hate the whole business.'       `So  do I,' said Sam. `And nothing will ever  be all  right  where that  piece of misery is.'       A man came and beckoned to the  hobbits, and took them to the recess at  the back of the cave. Faramir was sitting there in  his  chair, and the lamp  had been  rekindled  in its  niche above his head. He signed to them  to  sit  down  on the  stools beside him. `Bring wine for the guests,'  he said. `And  bring the prisoner to me.'       The wine was brought, and then  Anborn came carrying Gollum. He  removed  the cover from  Gollum's head and set him on his feet standing behind him to  support him. Gollum blinked, hooding the malice of his eyes with their heavy  pale lids. A  very miserable creature he looked, dripping and dank, smelling   of fish (he still clutched one in his  hand); his sparse locks were  hanging  like rank weed over his bony brows, his nose was snivelling.       `Loose us! Loose us! '  he said.  `The  cord hurts us, yes it does,  it  hurts us, and we've done nothing.'       `Nothing? ' said  Faramir, looking at the wretched creature with a keen  glance, but  without any expression in his face either of anger, or pity, or  wonder. 'Nothing? Have you never done anything worthy of binding or of  worse   ####-punishment? However, that  is not for me to judge, happily. But tonight  you   have  come  where  it  is  death to come. The fish of this  pool  are dearly  bought.'       Gollum dropped the fish from his hand. `Don't want fish,' he said.       'The  price  is not set on the fish,' said  Faramir. `Only to come here  and look on the pool bears the penalty of death. I have spared you so far at  the  prayer  of Frodo here, who says that  of him at least you have deserved  some thanks. But you must also satisfy me. What is  your name? Whence do  you  come? And whither do you go? What is your business?  '       `We are  lost, lost,' said  Gollum. 'No name, no business, no Precious,  nothing. Only empty. Only hungry; yes, we  are hungry. A  few little fishes,   nasty bony little fishes, for a  poor creature, and they say  death. So wise  they are; so just, so very just.'       'Not very wise,' said Faramir.  'But just: yes perhaps, as just  as our  little wisdom allows. Unloose him Frodo! ' Faramir  took a small  nail-knife  from his belt and  handed it to Frodo. Gollum misunderstanding  the gesture,   squealed and fell down.       'Now, Smjagol! ' said Frodo.  'You must trust me. I will not desert you.  Answer truthfully, if you can.  It will  do you  good not  harm.' He cut the  cords on Gollum's wrists and ankles and raised him to his feet.       'Come hither! ' said Faramir. `Look at me! Do you know the name of this  place? Have you been here before? '       Slowly Gollum  raised his eyes and  looked  unwillingly into Faramir's.   All light went out of them, and they stared bleak and pale for a moment into  the clear unwavering  eyes of the man of Gondor."
