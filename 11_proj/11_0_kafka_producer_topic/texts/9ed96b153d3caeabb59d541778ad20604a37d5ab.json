They  have  set a fire in his flesh. But soon all shall be burned. The  West has failed.  It shall  all  go up in a  great fire, and all shall be  ended. Ash! Ash and  smoke blown away on the wind!'       Then  Gandalf  seeing the madness  that was on  him feared that he  had  already done some evil deed, and he thrust forward, with Beregond and Pippin  behind him, while Denethor gave back until he stood beside the table within.  But  there they found Faramir,  still dreaming in  his fever, lying upon the  table. Wood was piled under it, and high all about it, and all  was drenched  with oil, even the garments of Faramir and the coverlets; but as yet no fire  had been set to the fuel. Then Gandalf revealed the strength that lay hid in   ####-him; even as the light of  his  power was hidden u nder his  grey mantle.  He  leaped up on to the faggots, and raising the sick man lightly he sprang down  again, and bore him towards the door. But as he did  so  Faramir moaned  and  called on his father in his dream.       Denethor started as one waking from a trance, and the flame died in his  eyes,  and he wept; and he said: 'Do not take my son from me!  He calls  for   me.'       'He calls,' said Gandalf, 'but you cannot come to him yet.  For he must   seek healing on the threshold of death, and maybe find it no t. Whereas  your   part is to go out to  the battle of your City, where maybe death awaits you.  This you know in your heart.'       'He will not wake again,' said Denethor. 'Battle is vain. Why should we  wish to live longer? Why should we not go to death side by side?'       'Authority is not given to you, Steward of Gondor, to order the hour of  your  death,'  answered  Gandalf.  'And only the  heathen  kings, under  the  domination of the Dark Power, did  thus,  slaying  themselves  in pride  and  despair, murdering their kin to ease their  own death.' Then passing through  the door he took  Faramir from the deadly house and laid him  on the bier on   which he had been brought, and which had now been set in the porch. Denethor   followed him, and  stood trembling,  looking with longing on the face of his  son. And for a moment, while all were silent and still, watching the Lord in  his throes, he wavered.       'Come!' said  Gandalf.  'We  are needed. There is much that you can yet  do.'       Then suddenly Denethor laughed . He stood up  tall  and proud again, and  stepping swiftly back to the table he lifted from it the pillow on which his  head  had lain.  Then coming to the  doorway he drew aside the covering, and  lo! he had between his hands  a palantnr. And as he held it up, it seemed to  those that  looked on that the  globe began to  glow with an inner flame, so  that the lean face of the Lord was lit as with a red fire, and it seemed cut  out of hard stone, sharp with black shadows, noble, proud, and terrible. His  eyes glittered.       'Pride and despair!' he cried.  'Didst thou  think that the eyes of the  White  Tower were blind? Nay, I have seen more than thou knowest, Grey  Fool.  For  thy hope is  but ignorance. Go then and labour in healing! Go forth and   fight! Vanity. For a little space you may triumph  on the field, for a  day.   ####-But against the Power that now arises there is no victory. To this City only  the first finger of its hand has yet been stretched. All the East is moving.  And even now the  wind of thy  hope cheats thee and wafts up Anduin a  fleet  with black  sails. The West has failed. It is  time for all  to  depart  who  would not be slaves.'       'Such  counsels  will make the  Enemy's victory  certain  indeed,' said  Gandalf.       'Hope on then!' laughed Denethor. 'Do  I not know thee, Mithrandir? Thy   hope is to rule in my stead, to stand behind every throne,  north, south, or   west. I  have read  thy  mind  and  its  policies.  Do I  not  know that you   commanded this halfling here to keep silence? That you brought him hither to  be a spy  within  my  very  chamber?  And yet  in our speech together I have  learned  the names and purpose of all thy companions. So! With the left hand  thou wouldst use me  for a little while as a shield against Mordor, and with  the right bring up this Ranger of the North to supplant me.       'But  I say to thee, Gandalf Mithrandir, I will not  be  thy tool! I am  Steward of the  House  of Anbrion.  I will not step  down  to be  the dotard  chamberlain of an upstart. Even  were his claim proved to me, still he comes  but of the line of Isildur. I will not bow to such a  one, last of  a ragged  house long bereft of lordship and dignity.'       'What then would  you have,' said Gandalf, 'if your will could have its  way?'       'I would have things as they were in all the days of my life,' answered  Denethor,  'and in the days of  my  longfathers before me: to be the Lord of  this City in peace,  and leave my chair to  a son after me, who would be his  own master and no wizard's pupil."
