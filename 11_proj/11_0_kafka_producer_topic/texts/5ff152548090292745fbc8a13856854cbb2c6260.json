Confused and worried, he sat reading the subject lists with  his tongue poking out, asking people whether they thought Arithmancy sounded more difficult than the study of Ancient Runes. Dean Thomas, who, like Harry, had grown up with Muggles, ended up closing his eyes and jabbing his wand at the list, then picking the subjects it landed on. Hermione took nobody's advice but signed up for everything.  Harry smiled grimly to himself at the thought of what Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia would say if he tried to discuss his career in wizardry with them. Not that he didn't get any guidance: Percy Weasley was eager to share his experience.  \"Depends where you want to go, Harry,\" he said. \"It's never too early to think about the future, so Id recommend Divination. People say Muggle Studies is a soft option, but I personally think wizards should have a thorough understanding of the non-magical community, particularly if they're thinking of working in close contact with them - look at my father, he has to deal with Muggle business all the time. My brother Charlie was always more of an outdoor type, so he went for Care of Magical Creatures. Play to your strengths, Harry.\"  But the only thing Harry felt he was really good at was Quidditch. In the end, he chose the same new subjects as Ron, feeling that if he was lousy at them, at least he'd have someone friendly to help him.  Gryffindor's next Quidditch match would be against Hufflepuff. Wood was insisting on team practices every night after dinner, so that Harry barely had time for anything but Quidditch and homework. However, the training sessions were getting better, or at least  drier, and the evening before Saturday's match he went up to his dormitory to drop off his broomstick feeling Gryffindor's chances for the Quidditch cup had never been better.  But his cheerful mood didn't last long. At the top of the stairs to the dormitory, he met Neville Longbottom, who was looking frantic.  \"Harry - I don't know who did it - I just found -\"  Watching Harry fearfully, Neville pushed open the door.  The contents of Harry's trunk had been thrown everywhere. His cloak lay ripped on the floor. The bedclothes had been pulled off his four-poster and the drawer had been pulled out of his bedside cabinet, the contents strewn over the mattress.  Harry walked over to the bed, open-mouthed, treading on a few loose pages of Travels with Trolls. As he and Neville pulled the blankets back onto his bed, Ron, Dean, and Seamus came in. Dean swore loudly.  \"What happened, Harry?\"  \"No idea,\" said Harry. But Ron was examining Harry's robes. All the pockets were hanging out.  \"Someone's been looking for something,\" said Ron. \"Is there anything missing?\"  Harry started to pick up all his things and throw them into his trunk. It was only as he threw the last of the Lockhart books back into it that he realized what wasn't there.  \"Riddle's diary's gone,\" he said in an undertone to Ron.  \"What?\"  Harry jerked his head toward the dormitory door and Ron followed him out. They hurried down to the Gryffindor common  room, which was half-empty, and joined Hermione, who was sitting alone, reading a book called Ancient Runes Made Easy.  Hermione looked aghast at the news.  \"But - only a Gryffindor could have stolen - nobody else knows our password -\"  \"Exactly,\" said Harry.  They woke the next day to brilliant sunshine and a light, refreshing breeze.  \"Perfect Quidditch conditions!\" said Wood enthusiastically at the Gryffindor table, loading the team's plates with scrambled eggs. \"Harry, buck up there, you need a decent breakfast.\"  Harry had been staring down the packed Gryffindor table, wondering if the new owner of Riddle's diary was right in front of his eyes. Hermione had been urging him to report the robbery, but Harry didn't like the idea. He'd have to tell a teacher all about the diary, and how many people knew why Hagrid had been expelled fifty years ago? He didn't want to be the one who brought it all up again.  As he left the Great Hall with Ron and Hermione to go and collect his Quidditch things, another very serious worry was added to Harry's growing list. He had just set foot on the marble staircase when he heard it yet again  \"Kill this time ... let me rip ... tear. . .\"  He shouted aloud and Ron and Hermione both jumped away from him in alarm.  \"The voice!\" said Harry, -looking over his shoulder. \"I just heard it again - didn't you?\"  Ron shook his head, wide-eyed. Hermione, however, clapped a hand to her forehead.  \"Harry - I think I've just understood something! I've got to go to the library!\"  And she sprinted away, up the stairs."
