'Then, said Glorfindel, 'let us cast it into the deeps, and so make the  lies of Saruman come true. For it is clear now that  even at the Council his   ####-feet were already on a crooked path. He knew that the Ring  was not lost for   ever, but wished us to think so; for  he began to lust  for  it for himself.  Yet oft in lies truth is hidden: in the Sea it would be safe.'       `Not safe  for ever,' said Gandalf. `There are many things in the  deep  waters; and seas and lands may  change. And it is not our part here to  take  thought only for a  season, or for a few lives  of Men, or for a passing age  of the world.  We should seek a final  end of this menace, even if we do not  hope to make one.'       'And that we shall not find on the roads to the  Sea,' said Galdor. 'If  the  return to Iarwain be  thought too dangerous, then  flight to the Sâ€ša is  now fraught with gravest peril. My heart tells me that Sauron will expect us  to take the western way, when he learns what has befallen. He soon will. The  Nine have been unhorsed indeed but that is  but a respite, ere they find  new  steeds and  swifter. Only the waning might of Gondor stands  now between him  and a march  in power along the  coasts into  the  North;  and if  he comes,  assailing the White Towers and the  Havens, hereafter the Elves may  have no  escape from the lengthening shadows of Middle-earth.'       'Long yet will that march be delayed,' said Boromir. 'Gondor wanes, you   say.  But  Gondor stands,  and even the end  of its strength  is  still very  strong.'       'And yet its vigilance can no longer keep back  the Nine,' said Galdor.  'And other roads he may find that Gondor does not guard.'       'Then,' said Erestor, `there are but two courses, as Glorfindel already  has declared:  to hide  the Ring  for ever;  or to  unmake it.  But both are  beyond our power. Who will read this riddle for us?'       'None here can do so,' said Elrond gravely. `At least none can foretell  what will come to pass, if we take this road or that. But it seems to me now  clear which is the road that  we must take. The westward road seems easiest.   Therefore it must  be shunned. It will be watched. Too  often the Elves have  fled that way. Now at this last we must take a hard road, a road unforeseen.  There  lies our hope, if hope it be. To walk into  peril-to  Mordor. We must  send the Ring to the Fire.'       Silence fell again. Frodo, even in that fair house,  looking out upon a   sunlit valley filled with the noise of clear waters, felt a dead darkness in  his heart. Boromir  stirred, and Frodo looked at him. He  was finger ing  his  great horn and frowning. At length he spoke.       'I do not understand all this,' he said. `Saruman is a traitor, but did   ####-he not have  a  glimpse of  wisdom?  Why  do  you speak  ever of  hiding and  destroying? Why should we not think  that the  Great Ring  has come into our  hands to serve us in the very  hour of need? Wielding  it the Free  Lords of  the Free may surely defeat the Enemy. That is what he most fears, I deem.       'The  Men of Gondor are valiant, and they  will never  submit; but they  may be  beaten down. Valour needs first strength, and then a weapon. Let the  Ring be  your  weapon, if it has such power as you say. Take it and go forth   to victory!'       'Alas, no,' said  Elrond. 'We cannot use  the Ruling  Ring. That we now  know  too well.  It belongs to  Sauron and was  made by  him  alone,  and is  altogether evil. Its strength, Boromir, is too great for anyone  to wield at  will, save only those who have already a great power  of their own.  But for  them it holds an  even deadlier peril.  The very  desire of it  corrupts the  heart. Consider  Saruman. If any of the Wise should with this Ring overthrow  the  Lord  of Mordor,  using  his own arts,  he  would then  set  himself on  Sauron's throne, and yet another Dark Lord would appear. And that is another   reason  why the  Ring should be destroyed: as long as it is in the  world it  will be a danger  even to  the Wise. For nothing  is evil in the  beginning.  Even Sauron was not so. I fear to  take the Ring to hide it. I will not take  the Ring to wield it.'       `Nor I,' said Gandalf.       Boromir looked at  them doubtfully,  but he bowed his head. `So be it,'  he said. `Then in Gondor we must trust  to  such weapons as we have.  And at  the least, while the Wise ones guard this Ring, we will fight on. Mayhap the  Sword-that-was-Broken may still stem the tide --  if the hand that wields it  has inherited not an heirloom only, but the sinews of the Kings of Men.'       `Who can tell?' said Aragorn. `But we will put it to the test one day.'       `May the  day not be too long delayed,' said Boromir."
