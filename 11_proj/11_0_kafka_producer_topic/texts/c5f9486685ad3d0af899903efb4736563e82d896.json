I   cannot allow him to pass.'       `But  he is from the Lonely Mountain, one of  Dbin's trusty people, and  friendly to Elrond,' said Frodo. `Elrond himself  chose him to be one of our  companions, and he has been brave and faithful.'   ####-     The  Elves  spoke together in  soft  voices, and questioned Legolas  in  their own tongue. 'Very good,' said Haldir at last. `We will do this, though  it is against our liking. If  Aragorn and Legolas will guard him, and answer   for him, he shall pass; but he must go blindfold through Lothlurien.       `But now  we must debate  no  longer. Your folk  must not remain on the  ground. We have been keeping watch on the rivers, ever since we saw a  great  troop of Orcs  going north toward Moria, along  the skirts of the mountains,   many days ago. Wolves  are howling on the wood's borders. If you have indeed  come from Moria, the peril cannot  be far behind. Tomorrow early you must go  on.       'The four hobbits shall c limb up here  and  stay with us-we do not fear  them! There is  another talan in  the next tree.  There the others must take  refuge.  You, Legolas, must answer to us for them. Call  us, if  anything is  amiss! And have an eye on that dwarf!'       Legolas at once went down the ladder to take Haldir's message; and soon   afterwards Merry and Pippin  clambered up on to the high flet. They were out  of breath and seemed rather scared.       `There!' said Merry  panting. `We  have lugged up your blankets as well  as  our own. Strider has hidden all the rest of  the baggage in a deep drift  of leaves.'       `You had no  need  of your burdens,' said  Haldir. `It is  cold in  the  tree-tops in  winter, though the wind tonight is  in the  South; but we have  food and drink to give you that will drive away the night -chill, and we have  skins and cloaks to spare.'       The  hobbits accepted this  second (and far better) supper very gladly.  Then they  wrapped themselves warmly,  not only  in  the fur-cloaks  of  the  Elves, but in their own blankets as well, and  tried  to  go  to  sleep. But  weary  as  they  were only  Sam found that  easy to  do. Hobbits do not like  heights, and do not sleep upstairs, even when they have any stairs. The flet  was not at  all to their liking as a  bedroom.  It had  no walls. not even a   rail; only on one side  was there a  light  plaited  screen,  which could be  moved and fixed in different places according to the wind.       Pippin went on  talking for a while. `I  hope, if I  do  go to sleep in  this bed-loft, that I shan't roll off,' he said.       `Once I do get to sleep,' said Sam, 'i  shall go on sleeping, whether I  roll off or no. And the less said,  the sooner I'll drop off, if you take my  meaning.'   ####-     Frodo  lay  for some  time awake,  and looked up  at the stars glinting  through the pale roof of quivering leaves. Sam was snoring at his  side long  before he himself closed his eyes. He could dimly see  the grey forms of two   elves  sitting motionless  with their  arms about  their  knees, speaking in  whispers. The other had  gone down to take up  his watch on one of the lower   branches. At  last lulled by the wind in the  boughs above,  and  the  sweet  murmur of the falls of Nimrodel below,  Frodo  fell  asleep with the song of  Legolas running in his mind.       Late in the  night he awoke. The  other hobbits were  asleep. The Elves  were gone. The sickle Moon was gleaming dimly among the leaves. The wind  was  still. A little way off he heard a harsh laugh and the tread of many feet on  the ground below. There was a ring of  metal. The sounds died  slowly  away,  and seemed to go southward, on into the wood.       A head  appeared suddenly through the hole in the flet. Frodo sat up in   alarm and saw that it was a grey-hooded Elf. He looked towards the hobbits.       `What is it? ' said Frodo.       `Yrch!' said  the Elf in a hissing whisper, and cast on to the flet the  rope-ladder rolled up.       'Orcs! ' said Frodo. `What are they doing? ' But the Elf had gone.       There were  no more  sounds. Even the leaves were silent,  and the very  falls  seemed  to  be hushed.  Frodo sat and  shivered in his wraps. He  was  thankful that they had not been  caught on the ground; but he felt  that the  trees offered little  protection, except concealment.  Orcs were  as keen as  hounds on  a scent, it  was  said, but they could  also climb.  He drew  out  Sting: it flashed and glittered  like a  blue  flame  and then  slowly faded  again and grew dull. In  spite  of the  fading of his  sword  the feeling of  immediate danger did no t leave Frodo, rather it grew stronger. He got up and  crawled to the opening and peered  down. He was almost certain that he could  hear stealthy movements at the tree's foot far below.       Not Elves; for  the  woodland folk were  altogether noiseless in  their  movements."
