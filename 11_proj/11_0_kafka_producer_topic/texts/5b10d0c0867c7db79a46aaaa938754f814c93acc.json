  "text": "' He was silent for some  time, and then he began not to  speak but to chant softly:       The leaves were long, the grass was green,       The hemlock-umbels tall and fair,       And in the glade a light was seen       Of stars in shadow shimmering.       Tin®viel was dancing there       To music of a pipe unseen,   ####-     And light of stars was in her hair,       And in her raiment glimmering.         There Beren came from mountains cold,       And lost he wandered under leaves,       And where the Elven-river rolled       He walked alone and sorrowing.       He peered between the hemlock-leaves       And saw in wander flowers of gold        Upon her mantle and her sleeves,       And her hair like shadow following.         Enchantment healed his weary feet       That over hills were doomed to roam;       And forth he hastened, strong and fleet,       And grasped at moonbeams glistening.       Through woven woods in Elvenhome       She tightly fled on dancing feet,       And left him lonely still to roam       In the silent forest listening.         He heard there oft the flying sound       Of feet as light as linden-leaves,       Or music welling underground,       In hidden hollows quavering.       Now withered lay the hemlock-sheaves,       And one by one with sighing sound        Whispering fell the beechen leaves       In the wintry woodland wavering.         He sought her ever, wandering far       Where leaves of years were thickly strewn,       By light of moon and ray of star       In frosty heavens shivering.       Her mantle glinted in the moon,       As on a hill-top high and far       She danced, and at her feet was strewn    ####-     A mist of silver quivering.         When winter passed, she came again,       And her song released the sudden spring,       Like rising lark, and falling rain,       And melting water bubbling.       He saw the elven-flowers spring       About her feet, and healed again        He longed by her to dance and sing       Upon the grass untroubling.         Again she fled, but swift he came.       Tin®viel! Tin®viel!       He called her by her elvish name;       And there she halted listening.       One moment stood she, and a spell       His voice laid on her: Beren came,       And doom fell on Tin®viel       That in his arms lay glistening.         As Beren looked into her eyes       Within the shadows of her hair,       The trembling starlight of the skies       He saw there mirrored shimmering.       Tin®viel the elven-fair,       Immortal maiden elven-wise,       About him cast her shadowy hair       And arms like silver glimmering.         Long was the way that fate them bore,       O'er stony mountains cold and grey,       Through halls of iron and darkling door,       And woods of nightshade morrowless.       The Sundering Seas between them lay,       And yet at last they met once more,       And long ago they passed away       In the forest singing sorrowless.   ####-     Strider sighed and paused before he spoke again.  'That is a song,'  he  said, 'in the mode that  is called ann-thennath  among the Elves, but is hard  to render in our Common Speech, and this is  but a rough echo of it. It tells  of the meeting of Beren son  of  Barahir and  L®thien Tin®viel. Beren was  a  mortal man,  but L®thien was the daughter of Thingol,  a King  of Elves upon  Middle-earth when the world was young; and  she was the fairest  maiden that  has ever been among all  the children of this world. As  the stars above the  mists  of  the Northern  lands was her loveliness,  and  in her  face  was a   shining light. In those days  the Great Enemy, of  whom Sauron of Mordor was  but a servant, dwelt  in Angband  in the North,  and the  Elves of the  West  coming back to Middle-earth made  war upon him to regain the Silmarils which  he had  stolen; and  the fathers of Men aided the Elves. But the  Enemy  was  victorious  and Barahir  was slain,  and Beren escaping through great  peril  came over the Mountains of Terror into the hidden Kingdom of Thingol in  the  forest of Neldoreth.  There he beheld L®thien singing and dancing in a glade  beside the enchanted  river Esgalduin; and  he named  her Tin®viel,  that is  Nightingale in the language of old. Many sorrows befell them afterwards, and  they  were parted long. Tin®viel rescued Beren from  the dungeons of Sauron,  and together they passed through great dangers, and cast down even the Great  Enemy  from  his  throne, and took  from  his  iron  crown one of the  three  Silmarils, brightest of  all jewels, to  be  the  bride-price of L®thien  to  Thingol her father. Yet  at the last  Beren  was slain by the Wolf that came  from  the gates  of  Angband, and he died in  the arms of Tin®viel.  But she  chose mortality, and to die from  the world,  so that  she might follow him;  and it  is sung that they met again beyond the Sundering  Seas, and  after a   brief time walking alive once more in the green woods, together they passed,  long ago, beyond the confines of this  world."
