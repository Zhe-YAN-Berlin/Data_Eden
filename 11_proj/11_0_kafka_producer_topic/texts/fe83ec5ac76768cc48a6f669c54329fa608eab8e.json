'But not so great that we who dwell there  ever tire of seeing new trees. I  should dearly love to journey in Fangorn's  Wood. I  scarcely passed beyond the eaves of it, and  I did not wish to turn  back.'       Treebeard's eyes gleamed with pleasure. 'I hope you may have your wish,   ere the hills be much older,' he said.       'I will come,  if  I  have the fortune,' said  Legolas.  'I have made a   bargain  with  my friend  that, if  all  goes well,  we  will  visit Fangorn  together -- by your leave.'       'Any Elf that comes with you will be welcome,' said Treebeard.       'The  friend I speak of  is not an Elf,' said Legolas; 'I  mean  Gimli,   ####-Gluin's son here.' Gimli bowed  low,  and the  axe slipped from his belt and  clattered on the ground.       'Hoom, hm! Ah now,' said Treebeard, looking dark-eyed at him. 'A  dwarf  and  an axe-bearer! Hoom! I have good  will to Elves; but you ask much. This  is  a strange  friendship!' 'Strange it  may seem,' said Legolas; 'but while  Gimli lives I shall not come to Fangorn alone. His axe is not for trees, but  for  orc-necks, O Fangorn, Master of Fangorn's  Wood.  Forty-two he hewed in  the battle.'       'Hoo! Come now!' said Treebeard.  'That is a better  story! Well, well,  things will go as they will; and there is no need to hurry to meet them. But  now we must part for a while. Day is drawing to an end, yet Gandalf says you  must go ere nightfall, and the Lord of the Mark is eager for his own house.'       'Yes,  we must go, and go  now,' said Gandalf. 'I fear that I must take  your gatekeepers from you. But you will manage well enough without them.'       'Maybe I shall,' said Treebeard. 'But I shall miss them. We have become  friends in so short a while that I think I must be getting  hasty  -- growing  backwards towards youth, perhaps. But there,  they  are the first  new thing  under  Sun or Moon that I  have seen  for many a long,  long day. I shall not  forget them. I have put their names into the Long List.  Ents will  remember   it.       Ents the earthborn, old as mountains,       the wide-walkers, water drinking;       and hungry as hunters, the Hobbit children,       the laughing-folk, the little people,       they shall remain friends as long as leaves are renewed. Fare you well!  But if you hear news up in your pleasant land,  in the Shire,  send me word!   You  know what I mean: word or sight of the Entwives. Come yourselves if  you  can!'       'We  will!'  said Merry  and  Pippin together,  and  they  turned  away  hastily.  Treebeard looked at them, and was silent for a while, shaking  his  head thoughtfully. Then he turned to Gandalf.        'So Saruman would not leave?' he said. 'I did  not think  he would. His  heart is as rotten as a black Huorn's. Still, if  I were overcome and all my  trees destroyed, I would not come  while I had one dark  hole  left to  hide  in.'       'No,'  said Gandalf.  'But  you have not plotted to  cover all the world   ####-with your trees and choke all other living things. But there  it is, Saruman  remains to nurse his hatred and weave again such webs as he can.  He has the  Key of Orthanc. But he must not be allowed to escape.'       'Indeed no!  Ents will see to that,' said Treebeard. 'Saruman shall not  set foot beyond the rock, without my leave. Ents will watch over him.'       'Good!' said  Gandalf. 'That is what I  hoped. Now I can go and turn to  other matters with one care the less.  But you must be wary. The waters have  gone down. It will not be enough to put sentinels round the tower, I fear. I  do  not  doubt  that  there were  deep ways  delved under Orthanc,  and that  Saruman hopes to go and come  unmarked, before long.  If you  will undertake  the labour, I beg you to pour in the waters again; and do so, until Isengard  remains  a  standing  pool,  or  you  discover  the outlets.  When  all  the  underground places are drowned, and  the outlets blocked, then  Saruman must   stay upstairs and look out of  the windows.'       'Leave it to  the Ents!' said Treebeard.  'We shall  search the  valley  from head to foot and peer under every pebble. Trees are coming back to live  here, old  trees,  wild trees. The Watchwood we will call it. Not a squirrel  will go her e, but  I shall  know of it. Leave  it to Ents! Until seven times  the years  in  which  he tormented  us  have passed,  we shall  not  tire of  watching him.'   ####-     Chapter 11. The Palantnr            The sun was sinking  behind the long  western arm of the mounta ins when  Gandalf and his companions, and the king with his Riders, set out again from  Isengard. Gandalf took Merry behind him, and Aragorn took Pippin. Two of  the  king's men  went on ahead, riding swiftly, and passed soon out of sight down  into the valley. The others followed at an easy pace.       Ents in a  solemn  row stood like  statues at the gate, with their long  arms  uplifted, but they made  no sound."
