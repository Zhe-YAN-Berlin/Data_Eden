There is in her  and in  this land no evil, unless a  man  bring  it  hither himself.  Then let him beware!  But  tonight I shall sleep  without  fear  for the first time  since  I left Rivendell. And may  I sleep  deep, and forget for a while my grief! I am weary in body and in  heart.' He  cast himself down upon his couch and fell at once into a long sleep.       The others soon did the same, and no sound  or  dream  disturbed  their  slumber. When they woke they found that the light of day  was broad upon the  lawn before the pavilion.  and  the fountain rose and fell glittering in the  sun.       They remained some  days in Lothlurien, so  far as they could  tell  or  remember. All the while that they dwelt there the sun  shone clear, save for   a gentle  rain that fell at times, and passed away leaving all  things fresh  and clean. The air was cool and  soft, as if it were  early spring, yet they  felt about them the deep  and thoughtful quiet of winter.  It seemed to them  that they did little but  eat and drink and  rest, and walk among the trees;   and it was enough.       They had not seen  the Lord and Lady  again, and they had little speech  with the Elven-folk; for few of these  knew or would use the Westron tongue.  Haldir  had  bidden them  farewell and gone back again to the  fences of the  North, where great watch was  now kept since the tidings of Moria  that  the  Company had  brought. Legolas  was away much among the Galadhrim,  and  after  the  first  night  he  did not sleep with  the  other companions,  though he  returned  to  eat and talk with them. Often he  took Gimli with him  when he  went abroad in the land, and the others wondered at this change.       Now as the companions sat or walked together they spoke of Gandalf, and  all  that  each had  known and seen of  him came clear before their minds. As  they  were healed of hurt and weariness of body the grief of their loss grew  more keen. Often they heard nearby Elvish voices singing, and knew that they  were making songs  of  lamentation  for his fall,  for they caught  his name  among the sweet sad words that they could not understand.       Mithrandir, Mithrandir  sang  the Elves, O Pilgrim Grey!  For  so  they  loved  to  call  him.  But if Legolas was with  the  Company,  he would  not  interpret the songs for them, saying that he had not the skill, and that for   him the grief was still too near, a matter for tears and not yet for song.       It was Frodo who first put something of his sorrow into  halting words.    ####-He was seldom moved to make song or rhyme; even in Rivendell he had  listened  and had not sung himself, though his memory was stored with many things that  others had made before him. But now as he sat beside the  fountain in Lurien  and heard  about  him the  voices of the Elves, his thought took shape  in a   song that seemed fair to him;  yet  when he  tried to repeat it to Sam  only  snatches remained, faded as a handful of withered leaves.       When evening in the Shire was grey       his footsteps on the Hill were heard;       before the dawn he went away       on journey long without a word.         From Wilderland to Western shore,       from northern waste to southern hill,       through dragon-lair and hidden door       and darkling woods he walked at will.         With Dwarf and Hobbit, Elves and Men,       with mortal and immortal folk,       with bird on bough and beast in den,       in their own secret tongues he spoke.         A deadly sword, a healing hand,       a back that bent beneath its load;       a trumpet-voice, a burning brand,       a weary pilgrim on the road.         A lord of wisdom throned he sat,       swift in anger, quick to laugh;       an old man in a battered hat       who leaned upon a thorny staff.         He stood upon the bridge alone       and Fire and Shadow both defied;       his staff was broken on the stone,       in Khazad-dym his wisdom died.       `Why, you'll be beating Mr. Bilbo next! ' said Sam.   ####-     'No, I am afraid not,' said Frodo. 'But that is the best I can do yet.'       'Well, Mr. Frodo, if  you  do have another go, I hope you'll say a word  about his fireworks,' said Sam. `Something like this:        The finest rockets ever seen:       they burst in stars of blue and green,       or after thunder golden showers       came falling like a rain of flowers.       Though that doesn't do them justice by a long road.'       `No,  I'll  leave that  to  you,  Sam. Or perhaps to Bilbo. But-well. I  can't talk of  it any more. I can't bear to think  of bringing  the news  to  him.'       One  evening Frodo and Sam were walking  together in the cool twilight.   Both of them  felt restless again. On  Frodo suddenly the  shadow of parting   had fallen: he  knew somehow that the time was very near when  he must leave  Lothlurien.       `What do you think of Elves now, Sam?  ' he said."
