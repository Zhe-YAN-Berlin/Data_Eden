They seemed hardly to  have closed  their eyes when Glorfindel, who  had set himself to watch  while they slept,  awoke  them again.  The sun had  now climbed far into the  morning, and  the  clouds and mists of the night were gone.       'Drink  this!'  said  Glorfindel  to  them, pouring for  each in turn a   little liquor from his silver -studded flask  of leather.  It  was  clear  as  spring  water and  had no taste, and it did not feel either  cool or warm in  the mouth; but  strength  and vigour seemed to flow into all their limbs  as  they  drank  it. Eaten after that draught the stale  bread  and dried  fruit  (which was now all that they had left) seemed to satisfy their hunger better   than many a good breakfast in the Shire had done.       They had rested rather less than five hours when they  took to the Road  again. Glorfindel  still  urged them  on, and  only allowed two brief  halts  during the day's  march. In this way they covered almost twenty miles before  nightfall, and  came  to  a  point where the Road bent  right  and  ran down  towards the  bottom of the valley,  now making  straight for the Bruinen. So   far there had been no sign or sound of pursuit that the hobbits could see or   hear; but often  Glorfindel would  halt and  listen  for  a moment, if  they  lagged behind,  and a look of anxiety  clouded  his face. Once or  twice  he  spoke to Strider in the elf-tongue.       But  however  anxious  their  guides might be,  it  was plain  that the  hobbits could go no further that night. They were stumbling along dizzy with  weariness, and unable to think of anything but their feet and legs.  Frodo's  pain had redoubled, and during the day things about him faded to shadows  of  ghostly grey.  He almost welcomed the coming of  night,  for  then the world  seemed less pale and empty.       The  hobbits  were still  weary,  when  they  set out  again early next  morning. There were many miles yet to go between them and the Ford, and  they  hobbled forward at the best pace they could manage.       'Our  peril  will  be  greatest just  ere  we  reach the  river,'  said  Glorfindel; 'for my heart warns me that the pursuit is now swift behind  us,   and other danger may be waiting by the Ford.'       The  Road  was still running steadily downhill,  and there  was now  in   ####-places much  grass  at either side, in which  the  hobbits walked when  they  could, to ease  their tired feet. In the late afternoon they came to a  place  where the  Road went  suddenly under the dark shadow of tall pine-trees, and  then plunged into a deep cutting with steep moist walls of red stone. Echoes  ran  along as they hurried  forward; and there seemed to  be a sound of many   footfalls following their own.  All at once, as if through a  gate of light,  the Road ran  out again from the end of the tunnel into  the open.  There at  the bottom  of a sharp incline  they saw before  them a long  flat mile, and  beyond that  the  Ford of Rivendell. On  the  further side was a steep brown  bank,  threaded  by  a  winding  path;  and behind  that the tall  mountains  climbed, shoulder above shoulder, and peak beyond peak, into the fading sky.       There was still an  echo as  of following feet  in  the cutting   behind  them;  a  rushing noise as  if  a wind were  rising and pouring  through the  branches of the  pines. One moment Glorfindel turned  and  listened, then he  sprang forward with a loud cry.       'Fly!' he called. 'Fly! The enemy is upon us!'       The white  horse  leaped  forward.  The  hobbits ran  down  the  slope.  Glorfindel and  Strider followed  as  rear -guard.  They were only  half  way  across the flat, when suddenly there was a noise of horses galloping. Out of  the gate in the  trees that they had just left rode a Black Rider. He reined  his horse  in, and halted,  swaying in his saddle. Another followed him, and  then another; then again two more.       'Ride forward! Ride!' cried Glorfindel to Frodo.       He did not obey at  once, for a strange reluctance seized him. Checking  the horse to  a  walk,  he turned and looked  back. The Riders seemed to sit  upon  their  great steeds  like  threatening  statues  upon a hill, dark and  solid, while all the woods and land about them  receded as  if into a  mist.  Suddenly he knew  in  his heart that they were  silently commanding  him  to  wait. Then at  once  fear  and hatred awoke in him. His hand left the bridle  and gripped the hilt of his sword, and with a red flash he drew it.       'Ride on! Ride on!' cried Glorfindel, and then loud and clear he called  to the horse in the elf-tongue: noro lim, noro lim, Asfaloth!       At once the  white horse sprang away  and  sped like the wind along the  last lap of  the Road. At the same moment the  black horses leaped  down the  hill in pursuit, and from  the Riders came a terrible cry, such as Frodo had  heard filling  the woods with  horror in the Eastfarthing  far away."
