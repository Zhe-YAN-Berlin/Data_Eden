Draw, you knaves, you dogs!\"  They watched in astonishment as the little knight tugged his sword out of its scabbard and began brandishing it violently, hopping up and down in rage. But the sword was too long for him; a particularly wild swing made him overbalance, and he landed facedown in the grass.  \"Are you all right?\" said Harry, moving closer to the picture.  \"Get back, you scurvy braggart! Back, you rogue!\"  The knight seized his sword again and used it to push himself back up, but the blade sank deeply into the grass and, though he pulled with all his might, he couldn't get it out again. Finally, he had to flop back down onto the grass and push up his visor to mop his sweating face.  \"Listen,\" said Harry, taking advantage of the knight's exhaustion, \"we're looking for the North Tower. You don't know the way, do you?\"  \"A quest!\" The knight's rage seemed to vanish instantly. He clanked to his feet and shouted, \"Come follow me, dear friends, and we shall find our goal, or else shall perish bravely in the charge!\"  He gave the sword another fruitless tug, tried and failed to mount the fat pony, gave up, and cried, \"On foot then, good sirs and gentle lady! On! On!\"  And he ran, clanking loudly, into the left side of the frame and out of sight.  They hurried after him along the corridor, following the sound of his armor. Every now and then they spotted him running through a picture ahead.  \"Be of stout heart, the worst is yet to come!\" yelled the knight, and they saw him reappear in front of an alarmed group of women in crinolines, whose picture hung on the wall of a narrow spiral staircase.  Puffing loudly, Harry, Ron, and Hermione climbed the tightly spiraling steps, getting dizzier and dizzier, until at last they heard the murmur of voices above them and knew they had reached the classroom.  \"Farewell!\" cried the knight, popping his head into a painting of some sinister-looking monks. \"Farewell, my comrades-in-arms! If ever you have need of noble heart and steely sinew, call upon Sir Cadogan!\"  \"Yeah, we'll call you,\" muttered Ron as the knight disappeared, \"if we ever need someone mental.\"  They climbed the last few steps and emerged onto a tiny landing, where most of the class was already assembled. There were no doors off this landing, but Ron nudged Harry and pointed at the ceiling, where there was a circular trapdoor with a brass plaque on it.  \"'Sibyll Trelawney, Divination teacher,\"' Harry read. \"How're we supposed to get up there?\"  As though in answer to his question, the trapdoor suddenly opened, and a silvery ladder descended right at Harry's feet. Everyone got quiet.  \"After you,\" said Ron, grinning, so Harry climbed the ladder first.  He emerged into the strangest-looking classroom he had ever seen. In fact, it didn't look like a classroom at all, more like a cross between someone's attic and an old-fashioned tea shop. At leasttwenty small, circular tables were crammed inside it, all surrounded by chintz armchairs and fat little poufs. Everything was lit with a dim, crimson light; the curtains at the windows were all closed, and the many lamps were draped with dark red scarves. it was stiflingly warm, and the fire that was burning under the crowded mantelpiece was giving off a heavy, sickly sort of perfume as it heated a large copper kettle. The shelves running around the circular walls were crammed with dusty-looking feathers, stubs of candles, many packs of tattered playing cards, countless silvery crystal balls, and a huge array of teacups.  Ron appeared at Harry's shoulder as the class assembled around them, all talking in whispers.  \"Where is she?\" Ron said.  A voice came suddenly out of the shadows, a soft, misty sort of voice.  \"Welcome,\" it said. \"How nice to see you in the physical world at last.\"  Harry's immediate impression was of a large, glittering insect. Professor Trelawney moved into the firelight, and they saw that she was very thin; her large glasses magnified her eyes to several times their natural size, and she was draped in a gauzy spangled shawl. Innumerable chains and beads hung around her spindly neck, and her arms and hands were encrusted with bangles and rings.  \"Sit, my children, sit,\" she said, and they all climbed awkwardly into armchairs or sank onto poufs. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat themselves around the same round table.  \"Welcome to Divination,\" said Professor Trelawney, who had seated herself in a winged armchair in front of the fire. \"My name is professor Trelawney. You may not have seen me before. I find that descending too often into the hustle and bustle of the main school clouds my Inner Eye.\"  Nobody said anything to this extraordinary pronouncement. Professor Trelawney delicately rearranged her shawl and continued, \"So you have chosen to study Divination, the most difficult of all magical arts. I must warn you at the outset that if you do not have the Sight, there is very little I will be able to teach you."
