'Well,  you have kept at it, I must say.'       'I have quite finished, Sam,' said Frodo. 'The last pages are for you.'       On September the twenty-first  they set out together, Frodo on the pony  that  had  borne him  all the  way  from  Minas  Tirith, and was  now called  Strider; and Sam on his beloved Bill. It  was a fair golden morning, and Sam  did not ask where they were going: he thought he could guess.       They took the Stock Road over the hills and went towards the Woody End,  and they let their ponies walk  at their leisure.  They camped  in the Green  Hills,  and  on September the twenty-second  they rode gently down  into the  beginning of the trees as afternoon was wearing away.       'If that isn't the very tree you hid  behind when the Black Rider first  showed up, Mr. Frodo!' said Sam pointing to the left. 'It seems like a dream  now.'       It  was  evening, and the stars were glimmering  in the  eastern sky as  they passed the ruined oak and turned and went on  down the hill between the  hazel-thickets. Sam  was  silent,  deep in his memories. Presently he became  aware   that  Frodo  was  singing  softly  to  himself,   singing   the  old  walking-song, but the words were not quite the same.       Still round the corner there may wait       A new road or a secret gate;       And though I oft have passed them by,       A day will come at last when I       Shall take the hidden paths that run       West of the Moon, East of the Sun.       And  as if in answer,  from down below,  coming up the road out of  the  valley, voices sang:       A! Elbereth Gilthoniel!       silivren penna mnriel       o menel aglar elenath,       Gilthoniel, A! Elbereth!       We still remember, we who dwell       In this far land beneath the trees   ####-     The starlight on the Western Seas.       Frodo and Sam halted and sat silent in the soft shadows, until they saw  a shimmer as the travellers came towards them.       There was Gildor  and  many fair Elven folk; and there  to Sam's wonder   rode Elrond and Galadriel. Elrond wore a  mantle of grey and had a star upon  his forehead, and  a silver harp was in his  hand, and upon his finger was a   ring of gold with a  great blue stone, Vilya, mightiest of  the  Three.  But  Galadriel sat upon a white palfrey  and  was robed all in glimmering  white,   like  clouds  about the Moon; for  she herself seemed  to shine with a  soft  light.  On  her  finger was Nenya, the ring wrought of mithril ,  that bore a   single white stone  flickering like a frosty star. Riding slowly behind on a   small grey pony, and seeming to nod in his sleep, was Bilbo himself.       Elrond greeted  them gravely and graciously, and Galadriel  smiled upon   them. 'Well, Master Samwise,'  she said.  'I hear and see that you have used  my  gift well. The Shire shall now be  more than ever blessed  and beloved.'  Sam bowed, but found nothing to say. He had forgotten how beautiful the Lady  was.       Then Bilbo woke up and opened his eyes. 'Hullo, Frodo!' he said. 'Well,  I have passed the  Old Took today! So that's  settled. And now I think I  am  quite ready to go on another journey. Are you coming?'       'Yes, I am coming,' said Frodo. 'The Ring-bearers should go together.'       'Where are you going, Master?' cried Sam, though at last he  understood  what was happening.       'To the Havens, Sam,' said Frodo.       'And I can't come.'       'No, Sam. Not yet anyway, not  further  than the Havens. Though you too  were a Ring-bearer, if only  for a little while. Your  time may come. Do not  be too  sad, Sam. You cannot be always torn in two. You will  have to be one  and whole, for many years. You have so much to enjoy and to be, and to do.'       'But,' said  Sam, and tears started  in his eyes, 'I  thought  you were  going  to  enjoy the  Shire, too.  for years and  years, after all you  have  done.'       'So I thought too, once. But I have been too deeply hurt, Sam. I  tried  to  save the Shire, and it has been saved, but not  for me. It must often be  so, Sam, when things are in danger: some one has to give them up, lose them,  so that others may keep them. But you are my  heir: all that I had and might   have had I leave to you.  And also you  have Rose, and Elanor; and Frodo -lad   ####-will  come,  and  Rosie-lass,  and Merry, and  Goldilocks,  and Pippin;  and  perhaps more  that I  cannot see. Your  hands and  your wits will  be needed  everywhere. You will be the Mayor, of course, as long a s you want to be, and  the most famous gardener in history; and you will read things out of the Red  Book, and keep alive the memory of the age that is gone. so that people will   remember the Great Danger and so love their beloved land all the  more.  And  that will  keep  you as busy and as  happy as anyone can be, as long as your  part of the Story goes on."
