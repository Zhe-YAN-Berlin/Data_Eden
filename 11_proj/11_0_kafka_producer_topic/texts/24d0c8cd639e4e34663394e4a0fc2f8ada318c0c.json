For  a  long  time  he was  tossed and shaken, and then  slowly  the  darkness  gave way, and he came  back to the waking  world and found that it  was morning. Orders were shouted and he was thrown roughly on the grass.        There  he  lay for a while, fighting  with despair. His head  swam, but  from the heat in his body he guessed that he had been given another draught.   An Orc stooped over him, and flung him some bread  and a strip of raw  dried  flesh. He ate  the  stale grey  bread hungrily, but  not the  meat.  He  was  famished but not yet so famished as to eat flesh flung to him by an Orc, the  flesh of he dared not guess what creature.       He sat up and  looked about.  Merry was not  far away. They were by  the  banks  of a swift narrow  river.  Ahead mountains  loomed: a tall  peak  was  catching the first rays of the sun. A dark smudge of forest lay on the lower   slopes before them.       There was much shou ting and debating among  the Orcs; a  quarrel seemed  on  the  point  of  breaking  out again  between  the  Northerners  and  the  Isengarders. Some  were  pointing back  away south, and  some were  pointing  eastward.       'Very  well,' said Ugl®k. 'Leave them  to me then! No killing,  as I've  told you before; but if you want to  throw away  what we've come all the way  to get, throw it  away! I'll look after it. Let the fighting Uruk-hai do the  work, as usual. If you're afraid of the Whiteskins, run!  Run!  There's  the  forest,' he  shouted, pointing ahead. 'Get to it! It's your  best hope.  Off  you go!  And quick,  before I knock a few more heads off, to  put some sense   ####-into the others.'       There was some cursing and scuffling, and  then most of the Northe rners  broke away and dashed off, over a hundred of  them, running wildly along the  river towards the mountains.  The hobbits were left with the  Isengarders: a   grim  dark  band, four score at  least of large, swart, slant-eyed Orcs with  great bows and shor t  broad-bladed swords. A  few  of the larger and  bolder   Northerners remained with them.       'Now we'll deal with  Grishnbkh,'  said Ugl®k; but some even of his own  followers were looking uneasily southwards.        'I  know,' growled Ugl®k.  'The cursed horse-boys have got  wind of us.  But  that's all your  fault,  Snaga. You and the  other scouts ought to have  your ears cut  off. But we are the fighters. We'll feast  on horseflesh yet,  or something better.'       At  that moment Pippin  saw why some  of the  troop  had been  pointing   eastward. From  that  direction there  now came hoarse cries, and  there was  Grishnbkh again, and  at his  back a  couple  of  score of others like  him:  long-armed  crook -legged Orcs. They  had a red eye painted on their shields.   Ugl®k stepped forward to meet them. 'So you've come back?' he said. 'Thought  better of it, eh?'       'I've returned to  see  that  Orders are  carried out and the prisoners  safe,' answered Grishnbkh.       'Indeed!'  said Ugl®k.  'Waste  of  effort.  I'll see that  orders  are  carried out in my command. And what else did you  come back for? You went  in  a hurry. Did you leave anything behind?'       'I left a  fool,' snarled Grishnbkh. 'But there were some stout fellows  with him that are too good to lose. I knew you'd lead them into a mess. I've  come to help them.'       'Splendid!'  laughed  Ugl®k.  'But  unless  you've  got some  guts  for   fighting, you've taken the wrong way. Lugb®rz was your road.  The  Whiteskins  are coming. What's happened to your  precious  Nazgyl?  Has  he had  another   mount shot under him? Now, if you'd brought him along, that might have  been  useful-if these Nazgyl are all they make out.'       'Nazgyl, Nazgyl,' said Grishnbkh, shivering and licking his lips, as if  the word had a foul taste that he savoured painfully. 'You  speak of what is  deep beyond the  reach of your muddy  dreams,  Ugl®k,' he said. 'Nazgyl! Ah!   ####-All that  they make  out! One day  you'll  wish that you  had not said that.  Ape!' he snarled fiercely.  'You ought to know that they're the apple of the  Great Eye. But the winged  Nazgyl: not  yet, not yet. He won't let them show  themselves across the Great River yet, not too soon. They're for the War -and  other purposes.'       'You seem  to know a lot,' said  Ugl®k. 'More   than is good for you,  I  guess.  Perhaps those  in  Lugb®rz  might wonder how, and  why. But  in  the  meantime the  Uruk -hai of Isengard can do the dirty  work,  as usual.  Don't   stand slavering there! Get your rabble together! The other swine are legging  it to the forest. You'd better  follow.  You wouldn't get  back to the Great  River alive. Right off the mark! Now! I'll be on your heels.'       The Isengarders seized Merry and  Pippin again  and slung them on their   backs. Then the troop started off. Hour after hour they ran, pausing now and  again only to sling the hobbits to fresh  carriers."
