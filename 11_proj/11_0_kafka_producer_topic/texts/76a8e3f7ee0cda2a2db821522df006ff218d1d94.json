As far as  he could guess  the Orcs  had turned and gone into the very opening which Frodo  and  he  had  tried and found blocked. It was still blocked.       There  seemed to be a  great stone  in  the  way,  but the Orcs had got  through somehow, for he could hear their voices on the other side. They were  still running  along, deeper and deeper into the mountain,  back towards the  tower. Sam felt desperate. They were carrying off his master's body for some  foul purpose and he could not follow. He thrust and pushed at the block, and  he  threw himself against it, but it did not  yield. Then not far inside, or  so he thought,  he  heard the two captains' voices talking  again.  He stood  still  listening  for a little  hoping  perhaps  to learn something  useful.  Perhaps Gorbag, who seemed to belong to Minas Morgul, would come out, and  he  could then slip in.       `No,  I  don't  know,' said  Gorbag's voice. `The messages  go  through  quicker  than anything could fly, as a rule. But I  don't  enquire how  it's  done. Safest not to. Grr! Those Nazgyl give me the creeps. And they skin the  body off you as soon as  look at you, and leave  you all cold in the  dark on  the  other side. But He likes 'em;  they're His favourites nowadays, so it's  no use grumbling. I tell you, it's no game serving down in the city.'       `You should try being up here with Shelob for company,' said Shagrat.       'I'd like to try somewhere where there's  none of 'em. But the war's on  now, and when that's over things may be easier.'       `It's going well, they say.'       'They would.' grunted  Gorbag. `We'll  see. But anyway, if  it does  go  well,  there should  be  a lot more  room. What d'you  say?   -- if we get  a  chance, you and me'll slip  off  and set up somewhere on our  own with a few  trusty lads, somewhere  where there's good  loot nice and handy, and no  big    ####-bosses.'       'Ah! ' said Shagrat. `Like old times.'       `Yes,' said Gorbag. 'But don't count on it. I'm not easy in my mind. As  I  said, the Big Bosses, ay,' his voice  sank almost to a whisper, `ay, even  the  Biggest,  can  make mistakes. Something  nearly slipped you say. I say,  something has slipped. And we've got to  look out. Always the poor  Uruks to  put slips right, and small thanks. But don't forget: the enemies don't  love  us  any more than they love Him, and if they get topsides on Him, we're done  too. But see here: when were you ordered out? '       `About an hour ago,  just  before you  saw us.  A message  came: Nazgyl  uneasy. Spies feared on Stairs. Double vigilance. Patrol to  head of Stairs.  I came at once.'       'Bad business,'  said Gorbag.  `See  here  -- our Silent  Watchers were  uneasy more than two days ago. that I know. But my patrol wasn't ordered out  for another  day, nor any message sent to Lugb®rz either: owing to the Great  Signal going up, and the High Nazgyl going off to the war, and all that. And  then they couldn't get Lugb®rz to pay attention for a good while, I'm told.'       `The Eye  was busy elsewhere,  I  suppose,'  said Shagrat.  `Big things  going on away west, they say.'       'I daresay,' growled Gorbag.  `But in the meantime enemies  have got up  the Stairs. And what were you up to? You're  supposed to  keep watch, aren't  you, special orders or no? What are you for?'       `That's enough! Don't try and teach me my job. We were awake all right.   We knew there were funny things going on.'       `Very funny!  '       `Yes, very funny: lights  and  shouting and all. But Shelob was on  the  go. My lads saw her and her Sneak.'       `Her Sneak? What's that? '       `You  must  have  seen  him:  little thin  black  fellow; like a spider   himself, or perhaps more lik e a starved frog. He's  been  here  before. Came  out of Lugb®rz the first time, years  ago,  and  we had word from High Up to  let  him pass.  He's been up the Stairs once  or twice since then, but we've  left him  alone: seems  to  have some  understanding with  Her  Ladyship.  I   suppose he's no good to eat:  she wouldn't  worry about words from High  Up.  But a  fine guard you keep in the valley:  he  was up here a day  before all  this racket. Early last  night we  saw him. Anyway my lads reported that Her   Ladyship was having some fun, and that seemed good  enough for me, until the   ####-message came.  I thought  her  Sneak had  brought her a toy. or  that  you'd  perhaps  sent  her a present,  a  prisoner  of  war  or  something. I  don't  interfere  when  she's pla ying.  Nothing gets by  Shelob  when  she's on the  hunt.'       'Nothing, say you! Didn't you use your eyes back there? I tell you  I'm  not easy in my mind. Whatever came up the Stairs, did  get by. It cut her web   and got clean out of the hole. That's something to think about! '       `Ah well, but she got him in the end, didn't she? '       `Got him? Got who? This little fellow? But if  he was the only one then  she'd have had him off to her larder long before, and there he'd be now."
