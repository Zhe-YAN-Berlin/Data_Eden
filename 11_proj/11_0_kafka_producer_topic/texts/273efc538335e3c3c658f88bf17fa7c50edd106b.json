  "text": " No,  no song. Of course not, for the Ring'll be found, and  there'll be  no more songs. I can't help it. My place is  by Mr. Frodo. They  must understand that  --  Elrond  and the Council, and  the  great Lords and  Ladies with all their wisdom. Their plans  have gone wrong. I can't be their  Ring-bearer. Not without Mr. Frodo.'       But the  Orcs were  out  of his dim sight now. He  had  had no  time to  consider himself, but now he  realized  that he was  weary, weary almost  to   exhaustion: his legs would not carry him as he wished. He was  too slow. The  path seemed miles long. Where had they all got to in the mist?        There they were  again!  A good way  ahead still. A cluster of  figures  round something lying on the ground; a few seemed to be darting this way and  that, bent like dogs on a trail. He tried to make a spurt.       'Come on, Sam!  ' he said, `or you'll be too late  again.' He  loosened  the sword in its sheath. In a minute he would draw it, and then--       There was a wild clamour, hooting and laughing, as something was lifted  from the ground. 'Ya hoi! Ya harri hoi! Up! Up! '       Then a  voice shouted: `Now off! The quick way. Back to  the Undergate!  She'll  not  trouble us  tonight  by  all  the signs.'  The  whole  band  of  orc-figures  began  to move. Four in the middle were carrying a body high on  their shoulders. `Ya hoi!  '       They had taken Frodo's body. They were off. He could not catch them up.  Still he laboured on. The Orcs reached the tunnel and were passing in. Those  with the  burden  went  first, and  behind them  there  was a  good  deal of  struggling  and  jostling. Sam came on. He drew the sword, a flicker of blue  in his  wavering hand, but they did not see it. Even as  he came panting up,  the last of them vanished into the black hole.       For a moment he stood, gasping,  clutching his breast. Then he drew his   ####-sleeve across his face, wiping away the grime, and sweat, and tears.  'Curse  the filth! ' he said, and sprang after them into the darkness.        It no longer seemed very dark to him in the tunnel, rather it was as if  he  had  stepped out of  a thin mist into  a heavier fog. His  weariness was  growing but his will  hardened  all the more. He thought  he  could  see the  light of torches a little way ahead, but try as he would, he could not catch  them up. Orcs go fast in tunnels, and this  tunnel  they  knew well.; for in  spite of Shelob they were forced  to use it  often as the swiftest  way from  the Dead City over the mountains. In  what far -off time  the main tunnel and  the great round  pit had been  made, where Shelob had  taken up her abode in  ages past. they did not  know: but many byways they  had  themselves  delved  about in on either side, so as to escape the lair in their goings to and fro  on  the business of their masters.  Tonight they  did not intend to  go  far  down. but  were  hastening to find  a side-passage  that  led back  to their  watch-tower on  the cliff. Must of  them were gleeful,  delighted with  what  they had found and seen, and as they ran they gabbled and yammered after the  fashion of their kind. Sam heard the  noise  of their harsh voices, flat and  hard in the dead air, and he could distinguish two voices from among all the  rest: they were louder, and nearer to him. The  captains of the  two parties  seemed to  be bringing up the rear, debating as they went.       'Can't you  stop your rabble  making such a racket, Shagrat? '  grunted  the one. `We don't want Shelob on us.'       `Go on, Gorbag! Yours are  making  more than half the noise,'  said the  other.  `But let the  lads play! No need to worry about  Shelob for a bit, I  reckon. She's sat on a nail, it  seems, and we shan't cry about that. Didn't   you see: a nasty  mess all the way  back to  that cursed crack  of  hers? If  we've stopped it once, we've stopped it  a  hundred times. So let 'em laugh.  And we've struck a bit of luck at last: got something that Lugb®rz wants.'       'Lugb®rz wants it, eh? What is it, d'you think? Elvish it looked to me,  but undersized. What's the danger in a thing like that? '       'Don't know till we've had a look.'       'Oho! So they  haven't  told you what to expect? They don't tell us all  they  know, do  they? Not by  half. But they can make mistakes, even the Top  Ones can.'       `Sh, Gorbag!'  Shagrat's voice  was  lowered, so  tha t  even  with  his  strangely sharpened hearing Sam could only just  catch  what was said. 'They  may, but they've got eyes and ears everywhere; some among my lot, as like as   ####-not.  But there's no  doubt about it, they're troubled about something.  The  Nazgyl  down below are, by your account; and Lugb®rz is too. Something  nearly  slipped.'       `Nearly, you say! ' said Gorbag.       `All right,' said Shagrat, `but we'll  talk of that later: Wait till we  get to the Under -way.  There's a place there where  we can talk a bit, while  the lads go on.'       Shortly  afterwards  Sam saw the  torches  disappear."
