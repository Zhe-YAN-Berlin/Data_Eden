  "text": " `Smjagol smells it! ' he  said. `Leaves out of the elf-country,  gah! They stinks. He climbed in those  trees,  and  he  couldn't  wash  the  smell  off  his hands, my nice hands.'  Dropping the leaf, he took a corner of the   lembas  and nibbled it. He spat,  and a fit  of coughing shook him.       `Ach! No!  '  he spluttered. `You try to  choke poor Smjagol.  Dust and  ashes, he can't eat that. He must  starve. But  Smjagol  doesn't  mind. Nice  hobbits! Smjagol has promised.  He will  starve. He can't eat hobbits' food.  He will starve. Poor thin Smjagol! '       `I'm sorry,' said Frodo; `but I can't help  you, I'm  afraid.  I  think   this  food would do you good, if  you would try. But perhaps  you can't even   try, not yet anyway.'       The hobbits munched their  lembas in silence. Sam thought that it tasted  far better, somehow, than  it had for a  good while: Gollum's behaviour  had  made him  attend to its flavour  again.  But  he did  not  feel comfortable.  Gollum  watched every morsel from  hand to mouth, like an expectant dog by a   diner's  chair. Only  when they had finished and were preparing to rest, was  he apparently convinced that they had no hidden dainties that he could share  in. Then he went and sat by himself a few paces away and whimpered a little.   ####-     'Look here!  ' Sam whispered to Frodo, not too softly: he did not really  care whether Gollum heard him or  not. `We've got to get some sleep; but not  both together with that hungry villain nigh, promise or no  promise. Smjagol  or Gollum,  he won't change  his habits in a hurry, I'll warrant. You  go to  sleep, Mr. Frodo, and I'll call you when I can't keep my eyelids propped up.  Turn and about, same as before, while he's loose.'       'Perhaps you're right, Sam,'  said Frodo  speaking openly. 'There is  a  change  in him, but  just what kind of a change  and  how deep, I'm not sure  yet.  Seriously though,  I  don't think  there is any  need  for fear --  at  present.  Still watch if you wish.  Give me about  two hours, not more,  and  then call me.'       So  tired was Frodo that his head  fell forward  on his  breast  and he  slept. almost as soon as he had spoken the words. Gollum seemed no longer to  have any fears. He curled  up and  went quickly to sleep, quite unconcerned.  Presently his breath was hissing softly through his clenched  teeth,  hut he  lay still as stone.  After a while, fearing that he would  drop off himself,  if he sat listening  to his two companions breathing, Sam  got up and gently  prodded  Gollum.  His  hands  uncurled  and  twitched, but he made  no other  movement.  Sam bent  down and said  fissh close to his ear, but there was  no  response, not even a catch in Gollum's breathing.       Sam scratched his head. `Must really be asleep,' he muttered. `And if I  was  like Gollum,  he wouldn't  wake up  never  aga in.'  He  restrained  the  thoughts of his sword and the rope that sprang to his mind, and went and sat  down by his master.       When he woke up the sky above was dim, not lighter but darker than when  they had breakfasted. Sam leapt to his feet. Not least from  his own feeling  of  vigour and hunger, he suddenly understood that he had slept the daylight   away,  nine hours at least. Frodo was still fast asleep, lying now stretched  on  his  side. Gollum  was  not to be seen. Various  reproachful  names  for   himself  came  to  Sam's  mind,  drawn  from  the  Gaffer's  large  paternal  word-hoard; then  it  also occurred to him that his  master had been  right:   there  had  for the present been nothing  to guard against. They were at any  rate both alive and unthrottled.       'Poor wretch! ' he said half remorsefully. 'Now I wonder where he's got  to?  '       'Not far, not far! ' said a  voice  above him. He looked up and saw the  shape of Gollum's large head and ears against the evening sky.   ####-     'Here, what are  you doing? ' cried Sam, his suspicions coming back  as  soon as he saw that shape.       `Smjagol is hungry,' said Gollum. `Be back soon.'       'Come back now!' shouted Sam. 'Hi! Come back!' But Gollum had vanished.       Frodo  woke  at  the sound of Sam's shout and sat up, rubbing his eyes.  'Hullo!' he said. 'Anything wrong? What's the time?'       'I dunno,' said Sam. 'After sundown, I  reckon. And he's gone off. Says  he's hungry.'       `Don't worry!'  said Frodo. `There's  no help  for it. But  he'll  come  back, you'll see. The promise will hold  yet a while. And he won't leave his  Precious, anyway.'       Frodo made  light of it when he learned that they had slept soundly for  hours with Gollum, and a very  hungry Gollum too, loose beside  them. `Don't   think of any of your  Gaffer's hard names,' he said. 'You were worn out, and  it has  turned out well: we are now  both rested. And  we  have a hard  road  ahead, the worst road of all.'       `About the  food,' said Sam. 'How long's it going to take us to do this  job? And  when it's done, what are we  going to do then? This waybread keeps  you on  your legs in a wonderful way, though  it doesn't satisfy the innards  proper, as you might say: not to my feeling anyhow, meaning no disrespect to  them  as made it."
