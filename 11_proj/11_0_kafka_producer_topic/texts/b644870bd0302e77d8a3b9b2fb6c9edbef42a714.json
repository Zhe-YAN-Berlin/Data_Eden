And yet  in truth  I believe that  the news that Faramir  brings has some hope in it. For it seems clear that our Enemy has opened his  war at last and made the first  move while Frodo was still free. So  now for   many days  he will have his eye turned this way and that, away  from his own  land. And yet, Pippin, I  feel from afar his haste and  fear.  He  has begun  sooner than he would. Something has happened to stir him.'       Gandalf  stood for a moment in thought.  'Maybe,'  he  muttered.  'Maybe  even your foolishness helped,  my lad. Let me see: some five days ago now he  would discover that  we had thrown  down  Saruman and had  taken the  Stone.  Still  what of that?  We could  not use it to much  purpose, or without  his  knowing. Ah! I wonder. Aragorn? His time  draws  near. And he  is strong and  stern underneath, Pippin; bold, determined, able to take his own counsel and  dare great risks  at  need. That may be it. He may have used  the  Stone and  shown  himself  to the  Enemy,  challenging  him, for  this very purpose.  I  wonder. Well, we shall not know the answer till the Riders of Rohan come, if  they do not come  too  late.  There are evil days ahead.  To sleep  while we  may!'       'But,' said Pippin.       'But what?' said Gandalf. 'Only one but will I allow tonight.'       'Gollum,' said  Pippin. 'How  on  earth could they  be going about with  him, even following him? And I could see that Faramir did not like the place   he was taking them to any more than you do. What is wrong?'       'I cannot answer  that now,' said Gandalf. 'Yet  my heart guessed  that  Frodo and Gollum  would  meet  before the end. For good, or for evil. But of  Cirith  Ungol  I  will  not speak  tonight.  Treachery,  treachery  I  fear;  treachery  of  that  miserable creature. But so it must be. Let us  remember   that a traitor may betray himself and  do good that he does not  intend.  It  can be so, sometimes. Good night! '       The next day came with a morning like  a brown  dusk, and the hearts of   ####-men, lifted for a while by the return of Faramir, sank low again. The winged  Shadows were  not  seen again  that day,  yet  ever and anon, high above the  city, a faint cry would come,  and  many who heard  it  would stand stricken  with a passing dread, while the less stout-hearted quailed and wept.       And now Faramir was gone again. 'They give him no rest,' some murmured.  'The Lord drives his son too hard, and  now he must do the duty of  two, for   himself  and  for  the  one that  will  not return.'  And  ever  men  looked  northward, asking: 'Where are the Riders of Rohan?'       In truth Faramir did not  go  by  his own choosing. But the Lord of the  City  was master of his  Council,  and he was in no mood that day  to bow to  others. Early in the morning the  Council had been summoned.  There  all the  captains judged that because of the threat in the South their force  was too  weak  to  make any stroke of  war on  their own part,  unless perchance  the  Riders of Rohan yet should come. Meanwhile they must man the walls and  wait.       'Yet,'  said  Denethor,  'we  should  not  lightly  abandon  the  outer   defences,  the Rammas made with so  great  a  labour. And the Enemy must  pay  dearly for the crossing of the River. That he cannot do, in  force to assail  the City, either north of Cair Andros because of  the marshes, or southwards  towards Lebennin because of the breadth of the River, that needs many boats.   It  is at  Osgiliath that he  will  put his weight, as before  when  Boromir  denied him the passage.'       'That was but a trial,' said Faramir. 'Today we may make  the Enemy pay  ten times our  loss at  the passage and yet  rue  the  exchange.  For he can  afford  to lose a host better  than we to lose a company. And the retreat of  those  that we  put out  far afield  will  be per ilous, if he wins across in  force.'       'And what of Cair Andros?' said the Prince. 'That, too, must  be  held,  if Osgiliath  is defended.  Let  us  not forget  the danger on our left. The  Rohirrim may  come,  and  they may not. But  Faramir  has  told us  of great  strength drawing ever  to the Black Gate. More than  one host may issue from  it, and strike for more than one passage.'       'Much must be risked in war,' said Denethor. 'Cair Andros is manned and   no more  can be sent so far. But I will not yield the River and the Pelennor   unfought  - not if there  is a captain  here who has still the courage to do  his lord's will.'   ####-     Then all were silent, but at length Faramir said: 'I do not oppose your  will, sire. Since you are robbed of Boromir, I will go and do what  I can in  his stead  - if you command it.'       'I do so,' said Denethor.       'Then farewell!' said Faramir. 'But if I should return, think better of  me!'       'That depends on the manner of your return,' said Denethor."
