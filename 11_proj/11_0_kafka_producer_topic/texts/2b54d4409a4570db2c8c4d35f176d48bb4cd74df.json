You have no colour  now,  and I cast you from the order and from the Council.'       He raised his hand, and spoke slowly in  a clear cold voice.  'Saruman,  your  staff is broken.' There was  a  crack, and the staff  split asunder in  Saruman's hand, and the head  of  it fell down at Gandalf's feet. 'Go!' said  Gandalf. With a  cry Saruman fell back  and crawled away.  At that  moment a   heavy shining thing  came hurtling down from  above. It glanced off the iron   rail, even as Saruman left it, and passing close to Gandalf's head, it smote  the stair on which  he  stood. The rail  rang and snapped . The stair cracked  and splintered in glittering sparks. But the ball was unharmed: it rolled on   down the steps, a globe of crystal, dark,  but glowing with a heart of fire.  As it bounded away towards a pool Pippin ran after it and picked it up.   ####-     'The murderous rogue!' cried Jomer.  But Gandalf was unmoved.  No, that  was not thrown b Saruman, he said; nor even at his bidding, I think. It came   from a window far above. A parting shot from Master Wormtongue, I fancy,  but  ill aimed.'       'The aim was poor, maybe, because he could  not make up  his mind which  he hated more, you or Saruman,' said Aragorn.       'That may  be so,' said Gandalf.  'Small comfort will those two have in  their  companionship:  they  will  gnaw  one  another  with  words.  But the  punishment is just.  If Wormtongue ever comes out of Orthanc alive,  it will   be more than he deserves.        'Here, my  lad, I'll take that!  I did not ask  you  to handle it,'  he  cried,  turning sharply and seeing Pippin coming up the steps, slowly, as if  he  were bearing a great  weight. He went  down to meet him and hastily took  the dark  globe from the hobbit,  wrapping it in the folds of his cloak.  'I   will take care of this,' he  said. 'It is not a thing, I guess, that Saruman  would have chosen to cast away.'       'But he may have other things to cast,' said Gimli. 'If that is the end  of the debate, let us go out of stone's throw, at least!'       'It is the end,' said Gandalf. 'Let us go.'       They turned  their  backs on  the doors of Orthanc, and  went down. The  riders  hailed the king with joy, and saluted Gandalf. The  spell of Saruman  was broken: they had seen him come at call, and crawl away, dismissed.       'Well, that is done,' said Gandalf. 'Now I must find Treebeard and tell  him how things have gone.'       'He will have guessed,  surely?'  said  Merry. 'Were they likely to end  any other way?'       'Not likely,' answered Gandalf, 'though  they came to  the balance of a   hair. But I had reasons for  trying; some  merciful and some less so.  First   Saruman was shown that the power  of his voice was waning. He cannot be  both  tyrant  and counsellor. When the plot  is ripe it remains  no longer secret.  Yet he  fell into the trap, and tried to deal  with  his victims piece-meal,  while  others listened. Then I  gave him a last choice and  a  fair  one: to  renounce both Mordor and his private schemes, and  make amends by helping  us  in our need.  He knows our need,  none better.  Great service he could  have   ####-rendered. But he  has chosen to withhold it, and  keep the power of Orthanc.  He will not  serve, only command. He  lives now  in  terror of the shadow of  Mordor, and yet he still dreams of riding  the storm. Unhappy fool!  He will   be devoured, if the power of the East stretches out its arms to Isengard. We  cannot  destroy  Orthanc from without, but  Sauron  -- who knows  what he can  do?'       'And what  if Sauron does  not conquer? What will you do to him?' asked  Pippin.       'I? Nothing!' said Gandalf. 'I will do nothing  to him. I  do  not wish  for mastery. What w ill become of him? I  cannot say. I grieve that so  much  that was good now festers in the  tower. Still  for us things have  not gone  badly. Strange are the turns of fortune!  Often does  hatred hurt  itself! I  guess that, even if we had entered in, we  could have found few treasures in  Orthanc more precious than the thing which Wormtongue threw down at us.'       A shrill shriek; suddenly cut off, came from an open window high above.       'It seems  that  Saruman  thinks  so too,' said Gandalf.  'Let us leave  them!'       They returned now to the ruins of the  gate. Hardly had they passed out  under the arch, when, from among the shadows of the piled stones where  they  had stood, Treebeard and a dozen other Ents came striding up. Aragorn, Gimli  and Legolas gazed at them in wonder.       'Here  are three of my  companions,  Treebeard,' said Gandalf. 'I  have  spoken of them, but you have not yet seen them.' He named them one by one.       The Old Ent looked at them  long and searchingly, and spoke to  them in  turn.  Last  he  turned  to Legolas."
