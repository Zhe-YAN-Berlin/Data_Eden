Two  rode  towards  Frodo: two  galloped madly towards  the Ford  to  cut  off  his escape. They  seemed to him to run like the wind and to grow swiftly larger and darker, as  their courses converged with his.        Frodo looked  back for  a moment over  his shoulder. He could no longer   see  his friends. The Riders  behind  were  falling  back:  even their great  steeds  were no match  in  speed for the  white elf-horse of  Glorfindel. He  looked forward again, and hope fa ded. There seemed no chance of reaching the  Ford before he  was cut off by  the others that had lain in ambush. He could  see them clearly now: they appeared to have cast aside their hoods and black   cloaks, and they were robed in  white and  grey. Swords were  naked in their   pale hands; helms were on their heads. Their cold eyes  glittered,  and they  called to him with fell voices.        Fear now filled all Frodo's mind. He thought no longer of his sword. No  cry came from him. He shut his eyes  and clung to the horse's mane. The wind  whistled in his ears, and the bells upon the harness rang wild and shrill. A  breath of deadly cold pierced him like a spear, as with a last spurt, like a   flash of  white fire, the  elf-horse  speeding as  if on wings, passed right  before the face of the foremost Rider.       Frodo heard  the splash of water. It foamed about his feet. He felt the  quick heave and surge as the horse left the river and struggled up the stony  path. He was climbing the steep bank. He was across the Ford.       But the pursuers were close behind. At  the  top of  the bank the horse  halted and turned  about neighing  fiercely. There were  Nine  Riders at the  water's edge below, and Frodo's spirit quailed before  the  threat  of their  uplifted faces. He knew of nothing that would  prevent them from crossing as  easily as he had done; and he felt that it was useless to try to escape over   the long uncertain path from the Ford to the edge  of Rivendell, if once the  Riders crossed. In any case he felt that  he was commanded urgently to halt.   Hatred again stirred in him, but he had no longer the strength to refuse.       Suddenly the foremost  Rider  spurred  his horse forward. It checked at  the water and  reared  up.  With  a  great  effort  Frodo  sat  upright  and  brandished his sword.       'Go back!' he cried. 'Go  back to  the Land of Mordor, and follow me no  more! '  His voice sounded  thin and shrill  in his  own  ears.  The  Riders  halted, but Frodo had not  the power of Bombadil. His enemies laughed at him  with  a harsh and chilling laughter. 'Come back! Come back!' they called. 'To   ####-Mordor we will take you!'       'Go back!' he whispered.       'The Ring! The  Ring!'  they cried with  deadly voices; and immediately  their leader urged his horse forward into the water, followed closely by two  others.       'By Elbereth  and LÂ®thien  the Fair,' said Frodo  with  a last  effort,  lifting up his sword, 'you shall have neither the Ring nor me!'       Then the leader, who was now half across the Ford, stood up menacing in  his  stirrups, and raised up his hand.  Frodo was stricken dumb. He felt his  tongue  cleave to  his mouth,  and  his heart labouring. His sword broke and   fell out of his shaking hand. The elf-horse reared and snorted. The foremost   of the black horses had almost set foot upon the shore.       At that moment there  came a roaring and  a rushing: a  noise  of  loud  waters rolling many stones. Dimly  Frodo saw the river below him  rise,  and  down along its course there  came a  plumed cavalry of  waves.  White flames  seemed to Frodo to  flicker on their crests  and he half fancied that he saw  amid the water white riders upon white horses with frothing manes. The three  Riders  that  were still in  the midst of  the  Ford were  overwhelmed: they  disappeared, buried su ddenly under angry  foam.  Those that were behind drew  back in dismay.       With his  last failing senses Frodo  heard cries,  and it seemed to him  that he saw, beyond the Riders that hesitated on the shore, a shining figure  of white light;  and behind it ran small shadowy forms  waving flames,  that  flared red in the grey mist that was falling over the world.       The  black  horses were  filled  with madness, and leaping  forward  in  terror  they bore their riders  into the rushing flood. Their piercing cries  were drowned in the roaring of the river as it carried them away. Then Frodo  felt himself  falling,  and  the  roaring and  confusion seemed  to rise and  engulf him together with his enemies. He heard and saw no more.     ####-* BOOK II *         Chapter 1. Many Meetings            Frodo woke and found himself lying in bed. At first he thought that  he  had slept late, after a long unpleasant dream that still hovered on the edge  of memory. Or  perhaps he  had been ill? But  the ceiling looked strange; it  was flat, and it had dark beams richly carved."
