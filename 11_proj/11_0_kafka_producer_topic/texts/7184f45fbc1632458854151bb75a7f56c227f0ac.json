  "text": "####-SPECIAL NOTE:     In this reprint several minor inaccuracies, most of them noted by readers, have  been corrected. For example, the rune text now corresponds exactly with the runes  on  Thror's  Map.  More  important  is  the  matter  of  Chapter  Five.  There  the  true  story  of  the  ending  of  the  Riddle  Game,  as  it  was  eventually  revealed  (under  pressure)  by Bilbo  to Gandalf,  is  now  given  according  to  the Red Book,  in  place  of  the  version  Bilbo  first  gave  to  his  friends,  and  actually  set  down  in  his  diary.  This  departure  from  truth  on  the  part  of  a  most  honest  hobbit  was  a  portent  of  great  significance.  It  does  not,  however,  concern  the  present  story,  and  those who  in this edition make their first acquaintance with hobbit-lore need not troupe about  it.  Its  explanation  lies in the history of the Ring, as it was set out in the chronicles  of the Red Book of Westmarch, and is now told in The Lord of the Rings.    A final note may be added, on a point raised by several students of  the  lore of  the  period.  On  Thror's  Map  is  written  Here  of  old  was  Thrain  King  under  the  Mountain;  yet  Thrain  was  the  son  of  Thror,  the  last  King  under  the  Mountain  before  the  coming  of  the  dragon.  The  Map,  however,  is  not  in  error.  Names  are  often  repeated  in  dynasties,  and  the  genealogies  show  that  a  distant  ancestor  of  Thror  was  referred  to,  Thrain  I,  a  fugitive  from  Moria,  who  first  discovered  the  Lonely Mountain, Erebor, and ruled there for a while, before his people moved on  to the remoter mountains of the North.   ####-Chapter I <br>  An Unexpected Party  In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with  the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing  in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.  It  had  a  perfectly  round  door  like  a  porthole,  painted  green,  with  a  shiny  yellow  brass  knob  in  the  exact middle. The  door  opened  on  to  a  tube-shaped hall  like  a  tunnel:  a  very  comfortable  tunnel without  smoke, with  panelled walls,  and  floors  tiled  and  carpeted,  provided with  polished  chairs,  and  lots  and  lots of pegs  for  hats  and  coats - the hobbit was  fond of visitors. The  tunnel wound on  and on,  going  fairly  but  not  quite  straight  into  the  side  of  the  hill  -  The  Hill,  as  all  the  people for many miles round called  it - and many little round doors opened out of  it,  first  on  one  side  and  then  on  another.  No  going  upstairs  for  the  hobbit:  bedrooms,  bathrooms,  cellars,  pantries  (lots  of  these),  wardrobes  (he  had  whole  rooms devoted to clothes), kitchens, dining-rooms, all were on the same floor, and  indeed  on  the  same  passage. The  best  rooms were  all  on  the  left-hand side (going  in),  for  these  were  the  only  ones  to  have  windows,  deep-set  round  windows  looking over his garden and meadows beyond, sloping down to the river.   This  hobbit  was  a  very  well-to-do  hobbit,  and  his  name  was  Baggins.  The  Bagginses  had  lived  in  the  neighbourhood  of  The  Hill  for  time  out  of mind,  and  people considered them very respectable, not only because most of them were rich,  but  also  because  they  never had  any  adventures or did  anything unexpected: you  could tell what a Baggins would say on any question without the bother of asking  him. This  is a story of how a Baggins had an adventure,  found himself doing and  saying things altogether unexpected. He may have lost the neighbours' respect, but  he gained-well, you will see whether he gained anything in the end. The  mother  of  our  particular  hobbit  â€¦  what  is  a  hobbit?  I  suppose  hobbits  need  some description nowadays,  since  they have become  rare  and  shy of the Big  People,  as  they  call  us.  They  are  (or  were)  a  little  people,  about  half  our  height,  and  smaller  than  the  bearded Dwarves. Hobbits  have  no  beards. There  is  little  or  no  magic  about  them,  except  the  ordinary  everyday  sort  which  helps  them  to  disappear  quietly  and  quickly  when  large  stupid  folk  like  you  and  me  come  blundering  along,  making  a  noise  like  elephants  which  they  can  hear  a  mile  off.  They  are  inclined  to  be    at  in  the  stomach;  they  dress  in  bright  colours  (chiefly   ####-green  and  yellow);  wear  no  shoes,  because  their  feet  grow  natural  leathery  soles  and thick warm brown hair like the stuff on their heads (which is curly); have long  clever brown fingers, good-natured faces, and laugh deep fruity laughs (especially  after  dinner,  which  they  have  twice  a  day when  they  can  get  it). Now  you  know  enough  to  go  on  with.  As  I  was  saying,  the  mother  of  this  hobbit  -  of  Bilbo  Baggins, that is  - was  the fabulous Belladonna Took, one of  the  three remarkable  daughters  of  the  Old  Took,  head  of  the  hobbits  who  lived  across  The Water,  the  small river that ran at the foot of The Hill."
