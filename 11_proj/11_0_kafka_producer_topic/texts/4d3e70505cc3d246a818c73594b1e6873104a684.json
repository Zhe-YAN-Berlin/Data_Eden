' he said. `If you will try to run away. you must  be tied;   but we don't wish to hurt you.'       'It hurts us, it hurts us,' hissed Gollum. `It freezes, it bites! Elves  twisted it,  curse them! Nasty cruel hobbits! That's why we tries to escape,  of course  it is, precious.  We guessed they were cruel hobbits. They visits  Elves, fierce Elves with bright eyes. Take it off us! It hurts us.'       `No, I will not take it off you,' said Frodo, `not unless' -- he paused  a  moment in thought -- `not unless there is any promise you can make that I   can trust.'       'We  will swear to  do what he wants,  yes, yess,  said  Gollum,  still  twisting and grabbling at his ankle. `It hurts us.'       `Swear? ' said Frodo.       'Smjagol,' said  Gollum suddenly and clearly, opening his eyes wide and  staring at Frodo with a strange light. 'Smjagol will swear on the Precious.'       Frodo drew himself up, and again  Sam was startled by his words and his  stern voice. 'On the Precious? How dare you? ' he said. 'Think!       One Ring to rule them all and in the Darkness bind them.       Would you  commit your promise to that, Smjagol? It  will hold you. But   ####-it is more treacherous than you are. It may twist your words. Beware!'       Gollum cowered. 'On the Precious. on the Precious! ' he repeated.       `And what would you swear? ' asked Frodo.       `To be very very good,' said Gollum.  Then crawling to Frodo's  feet he  grovelled before him, whispering hoarsely: a shudder ran over him, as if the  words shook his very  bones with fear. 'Smjagol will swear never,  never, to  let Him  have  it.  Never! Smjagol will save  it. But  he  must swear on the  Precious.'       'No! not on it,' said Frodo, looking  down at him with stern pity. 'All  you wish is  to see it and touch it, if  you can,  though you know  it would  drive you mad. Not on it. Swear by it,  if you  will. For you know  where it  is. Yes,  you know, Smjagol. It is before you.'       For  a moment it appeared to Sam that  his master had  grown and Gollum  had shrunk: a  tall stern shadow, a mighty lord  who hid  his  brightness in  grey cloud, and at his feet  a little whining  dog. Yet the two were in some  way akin and not alien: they could reach one another's  minds. Gollum raised  himself and began pawing at Frodo, fawning at his knees.       'Down! down! ' said Frodo. `Now speak your promise!'       `We promises, yes I promise!' said Gollum. 'I  will serve the  master of  the Precious. Good master, good Smjagol, gollum, gollum!' Suddenly he  began  to weep and bite at his ankle again.       'Take the rope off, Sam!' said Frodo.       Reluctantly Sam obeyed. At once Gollum got up and began prancing about,  like a whipped cur  whose master  has patted it. From  that moment a change,  which lasted for some time,  came over him. He spoke  with less  hissing and  whining, and he spoke to his companions direct, not to his precious self. He  would  cringe and  flinch,  if  they stepped  near  him or  made any  sudden  movement,  and  he  avoided  the  touch of  their elven-cloaks; but  he  was  friendly,  and  indeed pitifully anxious  to  please.  He would cackle  with  laughter and caper, if any jest was made, or even  if Frodo  spoke kindly to  him, and weep if Frodo rebuked  him. Sam said little to  him of any sort. He  suspected him more  deeply than ever,  and if possible liked the new Gollum,  the Smjagol, less than the old.       'Well, Gollum, or whatever it is we're to call you,' he  said. 'now for  it! The Moon's gone. and the night's going. We'd better start.'       'Yes, yes,' agreed Gollum, skipping about. 'Off we go! There's only one  way across between the North-end and the South-end. I found it, I  did. Orcs   ####-don't use it,  Orcs  don't know  it.  Orcs don't cross the  Marshes, they go  round for miles and  miles. Very  lucky  you  came  this way. Very lucky you  found Smjagol, yes. Follow Smjagol!'       He took  a few  steps away  and  looked  back  inquiringly,  like a dog  inviting  them for  a  walk. 'Wait a bit, Gollum!'  cried Sam. `Not too  far  ahead now! I'm going to be at your tail, and I've got the rope handy.'       'No, no! ' said Gollum. 'Smjagol promised.'       In the  deep of night under hard  clear stars they set  off. Gollum led  them back northward for a while along the way they had come; then he slanted  to  the right away from  the steep edge  of the Emyn Muil,  down  the broken  stony slopes towards the vast fens below. They faded swiftly and softly into   the darkness. Over all the leagues of waste before the gates of Mordor there  was a black silence.     ####-   Chapter 2. The Passage of the Marshes            Gollum moved  quickly,  with his  head and  neck  thrust forward, often  using  his hands as well as his  feet. Frodo  and  Sam were hard put to it to  keep up with  him; but he seemed  no longer to have any thought of escaping,  and if they fell  behind, he  would turn and wait for  them."
