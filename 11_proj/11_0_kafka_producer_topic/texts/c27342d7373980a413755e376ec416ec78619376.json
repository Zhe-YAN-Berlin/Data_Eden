  "text": " Either because they were  quicker and hardier, or because of some plan of Grishnbkh's, the Isengarders  gradually passed through the Orcs of Mordor,  and Grishnbkh's folk closed in  behind. Soon they  were  gaining also on  the Northerners ahead.  The forest   began to draw nearer.       Pippin was bruised and torn,  his aching  head was grated by the filthy  jowl and hairy ear of the Orc that held him. Immediately in front were bowed  backs, and tough thick legs going up and down, up and down, unresting, as if  they were made of wire and horn,  beating out  the nightmare seconds  of  an  endless time.       In  the  afternoon Ugl®k's  troop overtook the  Northerners.  They were  flagging in the rays  of the  bright sun, winter sun shining in  a pale cool  sky though it was; their heads were down and their tongues lolling out.       'Maggots!' jeered the Isengarders. 'You're cooked. The Whiteskins  will  catch you and eat you. They're coming!'       A cry  from Grishnbkh  showed that  this was  not mere jest.  Horsemen,  riding very swiftly, had indeed been sighted: still  far behind, but gaining  on the Orcs, gaining on  them like a tide over the flats on folk straying in  a quicksand.       The  Isengarders  began  to run with a redoubled  pace that  astonished  Pippin, a terrific spurt it seemed  for the end of  a race. Then he saw that  the  sun was sinking, falling behind the  Misty Mountains;  shadows  reached  over the land. The soldiers  of Mordor lifted their heads and  also began to  put on  speed. The forest was dark and close. Already they had passed a  few   ####-outlying trees.  The land was beginning to slope upwards. ever more steeply;  but the  Orcs did not halt. Both Ugl®k and Grishnbkh  shouted, spurring them  on to a last effort.       'They will  make it yet. They will escape,' thought Pippin. And then he  managed  to twist  his neck.  so  as  to  glance back with  one eye over his  shoulder. He saw that riders away eastward were already level with the Orcs,  galloping over  the plain.  The sunset gilded their spears  and helmets, and  glinted  in  their  pale  flowing  hair.  They  were  hemming the  Orcs  in,  preventing them  from  scattering, and  driving them along the  line of  the  river.       He wondered  very much what kind of folk they were. He wished  now that  he had learned more in Rivendell, and looked more at maps and things; but in  those days the plans for the journey seemed to be  in  more competent hands,  and he had never reckoned with being cut off from Gandalf, or from  Strider,  and  even  from Frodo. All  that he  could remember  about  Rohan  was  that  Gandalf's horse, Shadowfax,  had come from  that land. That sounded hopeful,  as far as it went.       'But how will  they know that  we are not  Orcs?' he thought. 'I  don't   suppose they've ever  heard  of hobbits down  here. I suppose I  ought to be  glad that the beastly Orcs  look like being destroyed, but I would rather be  saved  myself.' The chances were that  he and Merry wou ld be killed together  with their captors, before ever the Men of Rohan were aware of them.       A few of  the riders appeared to be bowmen,  skilled at shooting from a   running horse. Riding swiftly into  range they shot arrows at  the Orcs that  straggled behind, and several of them fell; then the riders wheeled away out  of the range of the answering  bows  of their  enemies, who shot wildly, not  daring to halt. This  happened many  times, and on one  occasion arrows fell  among  the Isengarders. One  of them, just  in front of Pippin, stumbled and   did not get up again.       Night came down without the Riders closing in for battle. Many Orcs had  fallen,  but fully two hundred remained. In the early darkness the Orcs came  to a hillock. The eaves of the forest were very near, probably  no more than  three  furlongs  away,  but  they  could go no  further.  The  horsemen  had  encircled them. A small band  disobeyed  Ugl®k's command, and ran on  towards  the forest: only three returned.       'Well,  here  we are,' sneered Grishnbkh. 'Fine  leadership! I hope the   ####-great Ugl®k will lead us out again.'       'Put  those  Halflings  down!'  ordered  Ugl®k,  taking  no  notice  of  Grishnbkh. 'You, Lugdush, get two others  and stand guard over them! They're  not to be killed, unless the filthy Whiteskins break through. Understand? As  long  as I'm alive, I want 'em. But they're not to cry out, and  they're not  to be rescued. Bind their legs!'       The last  part  of  the order was  carried  out mercilessly. But Pippin  found that for the first time he was close to  Merry. The Orcs were making a   great deal of noise,  shouting and  clashing  their weapons, and the hobbits  managed to whisper together for a while.       'I don't think much of this,' said Merry. 'I feel nearly done in. Don't  think I could crawl away far, even if I was free.'       'Lembas!' whispered Pippin.  'Lembas: I've got some. Have  you? I  don't   think they've taken anything but our swords."
