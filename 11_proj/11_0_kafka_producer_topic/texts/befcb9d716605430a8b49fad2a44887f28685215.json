It was  a land in which it would be possible to  creep from hiding to hiding, unseen  by all but the most watchful eyes: possible at least for one  who was strong  and had no need for speed. For the hungry and worn, who had far to go before  life failed, it had an evil look.       Thinking  of all  these things Sam went back to his  master.  He had no  need to rouse  him.  Frodo was lying on his  back with eyes open, staring at  the  cloudy sky. 'Well, Mr. Frodo,' said Sam, 'I've been having a look round  and thinking a bit. There's  nothing on the roads, and we'd best  be getting  away while there's a chance. Can you manage it?'       'I can manage it,' said Frodo. 'I must.'   ####-     Once more they started, crawling from hollow to hollow, flitting behind  such  cover  as they could find,  but moving always in  a slant towards  the  foothills of the northern  range. But as they went the  most easterly of the  roads followed them, until it ran  off, hugging the skirts of the mountains,  away into a wall of black shadow far ahead. Neither  man  nor orc now  moved  along its flat grey stretches; for the Dark Lord  had almost  completed  the  movement of his forces, and even in the  fastness of his own realm he sought  the secrecy of night, fearing the winds of the world that had turned against  him, tearing aside his veils, and troubled with  tidings of  bold spies that  had passed through his fences.       The hobbits had  gone a few weary  miles when they halted. Frodo seemed  nearly  spent. Sam saw that he could not  go much further in  this  fashion,  crawling, stooping, now picking  a doubtful way very slowly, now hurrying at  a stumbling run.       'I'm  going  back on to the road while the light lasts, Mr.  Frodo,' he  said. 'Trust to  luck again! It nearly failed us  last time,  but  it didn't  quite. A steady pace for a few more miles, and then a rest.'       He was taking a far greater risk  than he knew; but  Frodo was too much  occupied  with his burden and with the  struggle in  his mind to debate, and  almost too hopeless  to care. They climbed  on to the  causeway and  trudged  along, down the hard cruel road that led to the Dark Tower itself. But their  luck held, and for the rest of that day they  met no living or moving thing;  and when night fell they vanished into the darkness of Mordor. All  the land  now brooded as at the coming of a  great storm: for the Captains of the West   had passed  the Cross-roads and  set  flames  in  the deadly fields of Imlad  Morgul.       So  the  desperate  journey  went  on, as the Ring went  south and  the  banners of the  kings rode  north. For the hobbits each day,  each mile. was  more  bitter than the one before, as  their  strength lessened and  the land  became more  evil.  They met no enemies by day. At times  by night,  as they  cowered or drowsed uneasily in some hiding beside the road, they heard cries  and the  noise  of  many  feet or the swift passing of some  cruelly  ridden  steed. But far  worse than all  such  perils was the ever -approaching threat  that  beat  upon them as they went: the  dreadful menace of  the  Power that  waited, brooding in  deep thought and sleepless malice behind  the dark veil   about  its  Throne.  Nearer  and nearer it drew,  looming blacker, like  the  oncoming of a wall of night at the last end of the world.   ####-     There  came at  last a dreadful nightfall; and even  as the Captains of  the West drew near to the end of the living lands, the two wanderers came to   an  hour of blank despair. Four days had passed since they had  escaped from  the orcs,  but the  time lay behind  them like an ever -darkening  dream. All  this  last  day Frodo  had not  spoken,  but had  walked  half-bowed,  often  stumbling, as if his eyes no longer saw the way before his feet. Sam guessed  that  among  all their  pains he  bore the worst, the growing weight  of the  Ring, a  burden on  the  body and a torment  to his  mind. Anxiously Sam had  noted  how his master's left hand would often be raised  as if to ward  on a   blow,  or to  screen his shrinking eyes from a dreadful  Eye that sought  to  look  in them.  And sometimes  his right  hand  would creep  to  his breast,  clutching, and  then  slowly,  as  the will recovered mastery, it  would  be  withdrawn.       Now as the blackness of night  returned Frodo sat, his head between his  knees, his arms  hanging wearily  to the ground where  his hands lay  feebly   twitching. Sam watched him, till  night covered them both and hid them  from  one another. He could no longer find any words to say;  and he turned to his  own dark thoughts. As for himself, though weary and under a  shadow of fear,  he still  had some strength left. The lembas had a virtue without which they  would  long  ago have  lain down to die. It did  not satisfy desire, and  at  times Sam's mind  was filled with the memories of food, and the  longing for  simple  bread  and meats."
