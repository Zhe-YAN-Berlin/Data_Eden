They could see it running on into  the wood, wide  in places  and open  above, though  every  now and again the  trees drew in and overshadowed it with their dark boughs. Up this path  they  rode. They were  still climbing gently, but they now  went much quicker, and  with better heart;  for it seemed to them that the  Forest had relented, and  was going to let them pass unhindered after all.       But after a while the air began to get  hot and stuffy. The  trees drew  close again  on either side, and they  could  no longer  see far ahead.  Now  stronger than ever they  felt again  the ill will  of  the  wood pressing on  them.  So silent was it that  the fall of their ponies'  hoofs, rustling  on  dead leaves and  occasionally  stumbling on hidden roots, seemed to thud  in  their ears. Frodo tried to sing a song to encourage them, but his voice sank   to a murmur.       O! Wanderers in the shadowed land       despair not! For though dark they stand,       all woods there be must end at last,       and see the open sun go past:       the setting sun, the rising sun,       the day's end, or the day begun.   ####-     For east or west all woods must fail...       Fail - even as he said the word his voice faded  into  silence. The air  seemed  heavy and the making  of  words wearisome. Just behind them  a large  branch fell from an  old overhanging tree with  a crash into  the  path. The  trees seemed to close in before them.       'They  do not  like all that about ending and failing,' said  Merry. 'I   should not sing any  more  at present. Wait till we do  get to the edge, and  then we'll turn and give them a rousing chorus!'       He spoke cheerfully, and if  he felt any great anxiety, he did not show  it. The  others did not  answer.  They were depressed.  A heavy  weight  was  settling steadily  on  Frodo's  heart, and he regretted now with every  step  forward that he had ever thought of challenging the menace  of the trees. He  was, indeed,  just  about  to stop and propose going back (if that was still  possible), when  things took  a  new  turn. The  path  stopped climbing, and  became for a while nearly  level. The dark trees drew aside, and  ahead they  could see  the path  going  almost  straight forward.  Before them, but some  distance off, there stood a  green  hill-top, treeless, rising  like a  bald  head out of the  encircling wood. The  path seemed to be making directly for   it.       They now hurried forward again,  delighted with the thought of climbing  out  for  a  while above the roof  of the Forest. The path dipped, and  then  again began  to climb upwards, leading them at last to the foot of the steep  hillside.  There  it left the trees and faded into the turf.  The wood stood  all round the hill like  thick  hair that ended sharply in  a circle round a   shaven crown.       The hobbits  led their  ponies up, winding  round and  round until they  reached the top. There they stood and gazed about them. The air was gleaming  and sunlit, but hazy; and they could not see to any great distance. Near  at  hand the mist was now almost gone;  though here and there it lay  in hollows  of the wood, and to  the south  of  them, out of a deep  fold cutting  right  across the Forest, the fog still rose like steam or wisps of white smoke.       'That,'  said Merry, pointing  with his hand, 'that  is the line of the  Withywindle. It comes down out of the Downs and flows south-west through  the  midst of the  Forest to join the  Brandywine below Haysend. We don't want to  go that way! The Withywindle valley is said to be  the  queerest part of the  whole wood  - the centre from which all the queerness comes, as it were.'   ####-     The others looked in the  direction  that  Merry  pointed out, but they  could see little but mists over the damp and  deep-cut valley; and beyond it  the southern half of the Forest faded from view.        The sun on the hill-lop was now  getting  hot. It must  have been a bout  eleven o'clock; but the autumn haze still prevented them from seeing much in  other directions. In the west they could not make out either the line of the  Hedge  or  the  valley of  the Brandywine  beyond  it. Northward, where they  looked most hopefully, they could see nothing that might be the line of  the  great East Road, for which they were making. They were on an island in a sea   of trees, and the horizon was veiled.       On the south-eastern  side  the ground fell very  steeply,  as  if  the  slopes  of  the  hill   were  continued  far  down  under  the  trees,  like  island-shores that really  are the  sides  of a mountain rising  out of deep  waters. They sat on the green edge and looked out over the woods below them,  while they ate their  mid-day meal. As  the sun rose  and  passed  noon they  glimpsed far  off  in  the east the grey-green lines  of the Downs  that lay  beyond  the Old Forest on that side."
