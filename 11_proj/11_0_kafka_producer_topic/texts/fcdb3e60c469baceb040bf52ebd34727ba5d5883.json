No road was made by the Men of Gondor in this region, for even in their  great  days  their realm did not reach up  Anduin beyond the Emyn  Muil; but  there is a portage-way somewhere on  the western shore, if I can find it. It  cannot yet have perished; for light boats used to journey  out of Wilderland  down to Osgiliath, and still did so until a few years ago, when the Orcs  of  Mordor began to multiply.'       'Seldom in my life has any boat come  out of  the North,  and  the Orcs  prowl on the east-shore,' said Boromir. `If you go forward, peril  will grow  with every mile, even if you find a path.'       `Peril lies ahead on every southward road,' answered Aragorn. `Wait for   us one day.  If we do  not return in that time, you will know that  evil has  indeed befa llen us. Then you must take a new leader  and follow him as  best  you can.'       It was with a heavy heart that Frodo saw Aragorn and Legolas climb  the  steep bank and vanish into the  mists; but his fears proved groundless. Only  two or three hours had passed, and it  was barely mid-day, when  the shadowy  shapes of the explorers appeared again.       `All is well,' said Aragorn, as he clambered down the bank. 'There is a   track,  and  it leads  to  a good landing  that  is still  serviceable.  The  distance is not great: the head of the Rapids is but half  a mile below  us,   and  they  are little more than a mile long.  Not far beyond them the stream  becomes clear  and  smooth again,  though it runs  swiftly. Our hardest task   will be to get our boats and baggage   to the old  portage-way. We have found  it, but it lies well  back from  the water -side here, and runs under the lee  of  a rock -wall, a furlong or more from the shore. We did not find where the  northward  landing  lies. If it  still  remains,  we  must  have  passed  it  yesterday night. We might labour far upstream and yet miss it in the  fog. I  fear we must leave the River now, and make  for the  portage-way  as best we  can from here.'       `That would not be easy, even if we were all Men,' said Boromir.       `Yet such as we are we will try it,' said Aragorn.       'Aye, we  will,' said Gimli. `The legs of Men will lag on a rough road,  while a Dwarf goes on, be the burden twice his own weight, Master Boromir! '       The task proved hard indeed, yet in the end it was done. The goods were   ####-taken out of the boats and brought to the top of the bank, where there was a   level space. Then the boats were drawn out of the water and carried up. They  were  far less heavy than any  had  expected.  Of what  tree growing in  the  elvish country  they were made not even Legolas knew; but the wood was  tough  and yet strangely light. Merry and Pippin alone could  carry their boat with  ease  along the  flat. Nonetheless it  needed the strength of the two Men to  lift  and haul them  over the ground that the  Company  now had to cross. It  sloped up away from the River, a tumbled waste of  grey  limestone-boulders,   with many hidden holes  shrouded with weeds and bushes;  there were thickets  of brambles,  and sheer dells;  and here and there boggy pools fed by waters  trickling from the terraces further inland.       One  by  one  Boromir and  Aragorn  carried the boats, while the others  toiled  and scrambled after them with the baggage. At last  all was  removed  and laid  on the  portage-way. Then with little further hindrance, save from  sprawling briars and many fallen  stones, they  moved forward all  together.   Fog still hung in veils upon the crumbling rock -wall, and to their left mist  shrouded the River: they  could hear it  rushing  and foaming over the sharp  shelves and stony teeth of Sarn Gebir, but they could not see it. Twice they  made the journey, before all was brought safe to the southern landing.       There the portage-way, turning back  to the water -side, ran gently down  to the shallow edge of a little pool. It seemed to have been  scooped in the  river -side, not by hand,  but by the  water  swirling  down  from Sarn Gebir  against a low pier of  rock that jutted out some way into the stream. Beyond   it the shore rose sheer into a grey  cliff, and there was no further passage  for those on foot.       Already the short afternoon was past, and a dim cloudy dusk was closing  in. They sat beside the water listening to the confused rush and roar of the  Rapids hidden in the mist; they wer e tired and sleepy, and their hearts were  as gloomy as the dying day.       'Well, here we are, and here we must pass another night,' said Boromir.  `We need sleep, and even if Aragorn had a mind to pass the Gates of Argonath  by night, we are all too tired-except, no doubt, our sturdy dwarf.'       Gimli made no reply: he was nodding as he sat.       `Let us rest as much  as  we can now,' said  Aragorn. `Tomorrow we must  journey by day again. Unless the weather changes once more and cheats us, we  shall have  a good chance  of slipping through, unseen  by any eyes  on  the   ####-eastern shore."
