And  so they came  before the Gateway and  halted  a   furlong from the walls. As yet no gates had been set up again, but a barrier   was laid across the entrance  to the City, and  there  stood men at  arms in  silver  and  black with long swords drawn.  Before the barrier stood Faramir   the Steward, and H®rin Warden of the Keys, and other captains of Gondor, and  the  Lady  Jowyn of Rohan with Elfhelm the Marshal and many  knights of  the   ####-Mark; and upon either  side of  the Gate was a great press of fair people in  raiment of many colours and garlands of flowers.        So now there was a wide space before  the walls of Minas Tirith, and it  was hemmed in upon all sides by the knights and the  soldiers of Gondor  and  of Rohan, and by the people of the City and of all parts of the land. A hush  fell upon all as out from the host stepped  the D®nedain in silver and grey;  and before  them  came  walking slow the Lord Aragorn. He was  clad in black   mail  girt  with silver, and  he wore a long mantle of pure white clasped at  the throat with a great jewel  of green that shone  from afar;  but his head  was bare  save for a star  upon his forehead bound  by a  slender fillet  of  silver.  With him were Jomer of Rohan,  and the Prince  Imrahil, and Gandalf  robed all in white, and four small figures that many men marvelled to see.       'Nay,  cousin! they are  not  boys,' said Ioreth to her  kinswoman from  Imloth  Melui,  who stood beside  her. 'Those  are Periain , out  of the  far  country of  the Halflings, where they are princes of great fame, it is said.  I should know, for I had one to tend in the Houses. They are small, but they  are valiant. Why, cousin, one  of them went  with only his esquire  into the  Black Country and fought with the Dark Lord all by himself, and set fire  to   his  Tower,  if  you can believe it. At least that is  the tale in the City.  That will be the one that walks with our Elfstone. They are dear friends,  I  hear.  Now  he  is  a marvel, the Lord Elfstone: not too soft in his speech,  mind  you, but  he  has a golden heart,  as  the saying is; and  he has  the  healing hands. (The hands  of the king are  the  hands of a healer(, I said;  and  that was how  it  was all  discovered. And  Mithrandir,  he said to me:  (Ioreth, men will long remember your words(, and--'       But  Ioreth  was  not  permitted  to  continue the instruction  of  her   kinswoman  from  the country,  for a single trumpet rang, and a dead silence  followed. Then forth from the Gate went  Faramir with H®rin of the Keys, and  no  others, save  that behind  them  walked four men  in  the high helms and   armour of the Citadel, and they bore a great casket of black lebethron bound  with silver.       Faramir met  Aragorn in  the  midst  of those there  assembled, and  he  knelt,  and said: 'The last  Steward of Gondor begs  leave to  surrender his  office.' And he held out a  white rod; but Aragorn took the  rod and gave it  back, saying:  'That  office is  not ended, and  it shall be thine  and  thy  heirs' as long as my line shall last. Do now thy office!'       Then Faramir stood up and spoke in  a clear voice:  'Men of Gondor hear    ####-now the  Steward of this Realm! Behold! one has come  to  claim the kingship  again at last. Here is Aragorn son of Arathorn, chieftain of the D®nedain of   Arnor,  Captain of the Host of  the West,  bearer of the  Star of the North,  wielder of  the Sword  Reforged, victorious  in  battle,  whose hands  bring  healing,  the Elfstone,  Elessar  of  the line of Valandil,  Isildur's  son,  Elendil's son of N®menor. Shall he be king and enter into the City and dwell  there?'       And all the host and all the people cried yea with one voice.       And Ioreth  said  to her kinswoman: 'This is just a ceremony such as we  have in the City, cousin; for  he has already entered, as I was telling you;  and he said  to me--' And then again she was obliged to silence, for Faramir  spoke again.       'Men of Gondor, the loremasters tell that it was the custom of old that  the king should receive the  crown from his father ere  he died; or if  that  might not be, that  he should  go alone and  take  it from the hands  of his  father  in the tomb  where  he was  laid.  But since things must now be done   otherwise,  using the authority of the Steward, I  have today brought hither  from Rath Dnnen the  crown of Edrnur the last king, whose days passed in the  time of our longfathers of old.'       Then the  guards stepped forward, and Faramir opened the casket, and he  held up an ancient  crown. It was shaped like the helms of the Guards of the  Citadel, save  that it was loftier, and it was all  white, and the  wings at  either side were wrought of pearl and silver in the likeness of the wings of  a sea -bird, for it was the emblem of kings  who came over the Sea; and seven  gems  of adamant  were  set  in  the circlet, and upon  its summit was set a   single jewel the light of which went up like a flame."
