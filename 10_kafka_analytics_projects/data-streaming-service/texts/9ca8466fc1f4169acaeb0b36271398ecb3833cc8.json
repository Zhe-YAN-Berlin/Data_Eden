That name  the hobbits  only knew in legends  of the  dark past, like a   shadow  in  the  background  of their  memories;  but  it  was  ominous  and  disquieting. It seemed that the  evil power in Mirkwood had been  driven out  by the White Council  only  to  reappear  in  greater  strength  in the  old  strongholds of Mordor. The  Dark Tower had been rebuilt,  it was  said. From  there the  power was spreading far and  wide,  and away far  east  and south  there were  wars and  growing  fear.  Orcs were  multiplying  again  in  the   mountains. Trolls were abroad, no longer dull-witted, but  cunning and armed  with  dreadful  weapons.  And there  were  murmured  hints of creatures more  terrible than all these, but they had no name.       Little of all this,  of  course, reached the ears of  ordinary hobbits.  But  even the deafest  and most stay-at-home began to hear queer  tales; and  those whose business  took  them  to  the  borders  saw strange  things. The  conversation in The  Green Dragon at Bywater,  one evening in the spring  of  Frodo's  fiftieth year,  showed that  even in the comfortable  heart of  the  Shire rumours had been heard, though most hobbits still laughed at them.       Sam Gamgee was sitting in one  corner near the fire,  and opposite  him  was Ted  Sandyman, the  miller's son;  and there  were various  other rustic  hobbits listening to their talk.       'Queer things you do hear these days, to be sure,' said Sam.       'Ah,'  said  Ted, 'you do, if you listen. But I can hear fireside-tales  and children's stories at home, if I want to.'       'No doubt you can,' retorted Sam, 'and I daresay  there's more truth in  some of them than you reckon.  Who invented the stories anyway? Take  dragons  now.'       'No thank 'ee,' said  Ted, 'I won't.  I heard tell of them when I was a   youngster, but there's no  call to  believe in  them  now. There's  only one  Dragon in Bywater, and that's Green,' he said, getting a general laugh.       'All  right,' said  Sam, laughing with the rest. 'But  what about these  Tree-men, these giants, as you might call  them? They do say that one bigger  than a tree was seen up away beyond the North Moors not long back.'       'Who's they?'       'My cousin Hal for one. He works for Mr. Boffin at Overhill and goes up  to the Northfarthing for the hunting. He saw one.'       'Says he did, perhaps. Your Hal's always saying  he's seen  things; and   ####-maybe he sees things that ain't there.'       'But  this  one was as big  as an elm tree, and walking - walking seven  yards to a stride, if it was an inch.'       'Then I bet it wasn't an inch. What he saw was an elm  tree, as like as  not.'       'But this one was  walking, I tell you; and there  ain't no elm tree on  the North Moors.'       'Then Hal can't have  seen one,' said Ted. There  was some laughing and  clapping: the audience seemed to think that Ted had scored a point.       'All  the same,'  said  Sam,  'you can't deny  that others besides  our  Halfast have seen  queer  folk crossing the  Shire  - crossing  it, mind you:  there are more that are turned back at the borders. The Bounders  have never   been so busy before.       'And I've heard tell  that Elves are moving west. They do  say they are  going to the harbours, out away beyond the  White Towers.' Sam waved his  arm  vaguely: neither he nor  any of them knew how far it was to the Sea, past the  old towers  beyond  the western borders  of the  Shire. But  it was  an  old  tradition that  away over  there stood the Grey  Havens, from which at times  elven-ships set sail, never to return.       'They are sailing,  sailing, sailing over the Sea,  they are going into  the West  and  leaving us,' said  Sam, half chanting the words, shaking  his  head sadly and solemnly. But Ted laughed.       'Well,  that isn't anything  new, if you believe the  old tales.   And I  don't see  what it matters to me or you.  Let  them sail!  But I warrant you   haven't seen them doing it; nor any one else in the Shire.'       'Well I don't  know,' said Sam  thoughtfully. He believed he  had  once  seen an Elf in the  woods, and still hoped to  see more one  day. Of all the  legends  that he had heard in his  early  years such fragments of tales  and  half-remembered  stories  about  the Elves as the hobbits knew,  had  always  moved him  most deeply. 'There  are some,  even in these parts, as  know the  Fair Folk and get news  of them,'  he said. 'There's Mr. Baggins now, that I  work for. He told me  that they were sailing and he knows a bit about Elves.   And old Mr. Bilbo knew more:  many's the  talk I had with  him  when I was a   little lad.'       'Oh, they're both cracked,' said Ted. 'Leastways old Bilbo was cracked,  and Frodo's cracking. If that's where  you get your news from, you'll  never    ####-want for moonshine. Well,  friends,  I'm  off home.  Your  good  health!' He  drained his mug and  went out noisily."
