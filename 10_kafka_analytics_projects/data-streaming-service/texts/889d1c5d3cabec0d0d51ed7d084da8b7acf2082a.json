Several gold sparks shot out of the end of it.  Fleur Delacour gave him a very patronizing look, and he desisted. Mr. Ollivander sent a stream of silver smoke rings across the room from the tip of Cedric's wand, pronounced himself satisfied, and then said, \"Mr. Krum, if you please.\" Viktor Krum got up and slouched, round-shouldered and duck-footed, toward Mr. Ollivander.  He thrust out his wand and stood scowling, with his hands in the pockets of his robes. \"Hmm,\" said Mr. Olhivander, \"this is a Gregorovitch creation, unless I'm much mistaken?  A fine wand-maker, though the styling is never quite what I. . . however. .\" He lifted the wand and examined it minutely, turning it over and over before his eyes. \"Yes.. . hornbeam and dragon heartstring?\"  he shot at Krum, who nodded.  \"Rather thicker than one usually sees. . . quite rigid. . . ten and a quarter inches. . . Avis!\" The hornbeam wand let off a blast hike a gun, and a number of small, twittering birds flew out of the end and through the open window into the watery sunlight. \"Good,\" said Mr. Ollivander, handing Krum back his wand.  \"Which leaves. . . Mr. Potter.\" Harry got to his feet and walked past Krum to Mr. Ollivander.  He handed over his wand. \"Aaaah, yes,\" said Mr. Ohlivander, his pale eyes suddenly gleaming.  \"Yes, yes, yes. How well I remember.\" Harry could remember too.  He could remember it as though it had happened yesterday.... Four summers ago, on his eleventh birthday, he had entered Mr. Ollivander's shop with Hagrid to buy a wand.  Mr. Ollivander had taken his measurements and then started handing him wands to try.  Harry had waved what felt like every wand in the shop, until at last he had found the one that suited him - this one, which was made of holly, eleven inches long, and contained a single feather from the tail of a phoenix.  Mr. Ollivander had been very surprised that Harry had been so compatible with this wand.  \"Curious,\" he had said, \"curious,\" and not until Harry asked what was curious had Mr. Olhivander explained that the phoenix feather in Harry's wand had come from the same bird that had supplied the core of Lord Voldemort's. Harry had never shared this piece of information with anybody.  He was very fond of his wand, and as far as he was concerned its relation to Voldemort's wand was something it couldn't help - rather as he couldn't help being related to Aunt Petunia.  However, he really hoped that Mr. Ollivander wasn't about to tell the room about it.  He had a funny feeling Rita Skeeter's Quick-Quotes Quill might just explode with excitement if he did.  Mr. Ollivander spent much longer examining Harry's wand than anyone else's. Eventually, however, he made a fountain of wine shoot out of it, and handed it back to Harry, announcing that it was still in perfect condition. \"Thank you all,\" said Dumbledore, standing up at the judges' table. \"You may go back to your lessons now - or perhaps it would be quicker just to go down to dinner, as they are about to end -\" Feeling that at last something had gone right today, Harry got up to leave, but the man with the black camera jumped up and cleared his throat. \"Photos, Dumbledore, photos!\"  cried Bagman excitedly.  \"All the judges and champions, what do you think, Rita?\" \"Er - yes, let's do those first,\" said Rita Skeeter, whose eyes were upon Harry again. \"And then perhaps some individual shots.\" The photographs took a long time.  Madame Maxime cast everyone else into shadow wherever she stood, and the photographer couldn't stand far enough back to get her into the frame; eventually she had to sit while everyone else stood around her.  Karkaroff kept twirling his goatee around his finger to give it an extra curl; Krum, whom Harry would have thought would have been used to this sort of thing, skulked, half-hidden, at the back of the group.  The photographer seemed keenest to get Fleur at the front, but Rita Skeeter kept hurrying forward and dragging Harry into greater prominence.  Then she insisted on separate shots of all the champions.  At last, they were free to go. Harry went down to dinner.  Hermione wasn't there - he supposed she was still in the hospital wing having her teeth fixed.  He ate alone at the end of the table, then returned to Gryffindor Tower, thinking of all the extra work on Summoning Charms that he had to do.  Up in the dormitory, he came across Ron. \"You've had an owl,\" said Ron brusquely the moment he walked in.  He was pointing at Harry's pillow.  The school barn owl was waiting for him there. \"Oh - right,\" said Harry. \"And we've got to do our detentions tomorrow night, Snape's dungeon,\" said Ron. He then walked straight out of the room, not looking at Harry.  For a moment, Harry considered going after him - he wasn't sure whether he wanted to talk to him or hit him, both seemed quite appealing - but the lure of Sirius's answer was too strong."
