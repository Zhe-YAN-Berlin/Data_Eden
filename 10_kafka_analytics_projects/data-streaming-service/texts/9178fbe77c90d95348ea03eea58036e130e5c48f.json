And he had promised  to bring  her food. But her lust was  not his lust. Little  she  knew of  or   cared for towers, or  rings, or  anything devised by mind  or hand, who only   desired death for all others, mind and body, and for herself a glut of life.  alone,  swollen  till  the  mountains  could no longer  hold her up and  the  darkness could not contain her.       But that  desire  was yet far  away, and long  now had she been hungry,  lurking  in  her den, while the power of  Sauron grew, and light and  living  things forsook his borders; and the city in the valley was dead, and  no Elf  or Man came near, only the unhappy Orcs. Poor  food  and  wary. But she must   eat, and however busily  they delved new winding passages from  the pass and  from their tower, ever she found  some way to snare them. But she lusted for   sweeter meat. And Gollum had brought it to her.       `We'll see, we'll see,'  he  said often to himself, when the evil  mood  was on him, as he walked the  dangerous road from  Emyn Muil to Morgul  Vale,  'we'll see. It may well be, O yes, it may well be  that when She throws away   ####-the bones  and the empty garments, we  shall find it, we  shall  get it, the  Precious, a reward for poor Smjagol who brings nice food. And we'll save the  Precious, as we promised. O yes.  And when we've  got  it  safe, then She'll  know  it,  O  yes,  then we'll  pay  Her back,  my precious. Then  we'll pay  everyone back! '       So he thought in an inner chamber of  his cunning, which he still hoped  to hide from  her,  even when he  had come  to her  again and had bowed  low  before her while his companions slept.       And as for Sauron: he  knew where she lurked. It pleased  him that  she  should dwell there hungry but unabated in  malice,  a more  sure  watch upon  that  ancient  path into his land than any  other  that his skill could have  devised. And Orcs, they were useful  slaves, but he  had them in  plenty. If  now and again Shelob caught them to stay  her  appetite, she was welcome: he  could spare them. And sometimes as  a man may cast a dainty to  his cat (his   cat he calls her, but she owns him not) Sauron would send her prisoners that  he had no better uses for: he would have them driven to her hole, and  report   brought back to him of the play she made.       So  they  both lived, delighting in  their  own devices,  and feared no  assault, nor wrath,  nor any end of their wickedness. Never yet had any  fly  escaped from Shelob's webs, and the greater now was her rage and hunger.       But  nothing of this evil which they had stirred  up against  them  did  poor Sam  know, except that a  fear  was growing on him, a menace  which  he  could not see; and such a weight  did it  become that it was a burden to him  to run, and his feet seemed leaden.       Dread was round him, and enemies before him in the pass, and his master  was in a fey mood  running  heedlessly to meet them. Turning  his  eyes away  from the shadow behind and the deep  gloom  beneath the cliff upon his left,  he looked  ahead, and he saw two things  that increased his  dismay.  He saw  that the sword  which  Frodo still held unsheathed was glittering  with blue  flame; and he saw that though the sky behind was now dark. still the  window  in the tower was g lowing red.       `Orcs! '  he muttered. `We'll never rush  it  like  this.  There's Orcs  about, and  worse than Orcs.' Then  returning  quickly to his  long habit of  secrecy, he closed  his  hand about the precious Phial  which he still bore.  Red  with his own living blood  his  hand  shone for  a moment, and then  he  thrust  the revealing light deep into  a pocket near his breast and drew his  elven-cloak about him.  Now he tried  to  quicken his pace.  His master  was   ####-gaining on him; already he was some twenty strides ahead, flitting on like a   shadow; soon he would be lost to sight in that grey world.       Hardly had  Sam hidden the light  of  the star -glass  when she came.  A  little way ahead and to his left he saw suddenly, issuing  from a black hole  of  shadow under the cliff, the most loathly  shape that he had ever beheld,  horrible beyond the horror of an evil dream. Most like a spider she was, but  huger than  the great hunting beasts, and more terrible than they because of  the evil  purpose  in her remorseless eyes.  Those  same  eyes  that  he had  thought daunted and defeated, there  they were lit with a fell light  again,  clustering in her out-thrust head. Great horns she had, and behind her short  stalk -like neck was her huge swollen body,  a vast bloated bag, swaying  and  sagging  between  her legs; its great  bulk was black,  blotched  with livid  marks, but  the belly underneath  was pale  and  luminous  and  gave forth a   stench."
