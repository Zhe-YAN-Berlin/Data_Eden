A  feast!'  said  Merry. `As soon as Gandalf reported  that  you were  recovered, the  preparations began.' He  had hardly finished  speaking when they were summoned to the hall by the ringing of many bells.       The  hall of Elrond's house was filled with folk: Elves  for  the  most   part,  though there wer e a  few guests of other  sorts.  Elrond, as  was his  custom, sat in a great chair at the end of the long table upon the dais; and  next to him on the one side sat Glorfindel, on the other side sat Gandalf.        Frodo looked at them in wonder, for he had never before seen Elrond, of  whom  so many tales spoke; and as they sat upon his right hand and his left,   Glorfindel, and even Gandalf, whom he thought he knew so well, were  revealed  as lords of dignity and power. Gandalf was shorter in stature than the other  two; but his  long  white  hair, his  sweeping silver beard, and  his  broad  shoulders, made him look like some wise king of ancient  legend. In his aged  face under  great snowy brows  his dark eyes  were set like coals that could  leap suddenly into fire.       Glorfindel  was tall and straight;  his  hair was of shining gold,  his  face fair and young and fearless and full  of  joy; his eyes were bright and  keen, and his voice like music; on his brow sat wisdom, and  in his hand was  strength.       The face  of Elrond was ageless, neither old nor young, though in it was   ####-written the memory of many things both glad and sorrowful. His hair was dark  as the shadows of twilight, and upon  it  was set  a circlet  of silver; his  eyes were grey as a clear evening, and in them was a light like the light of  stars. Venerable he seemed as a king crowned with many winters, and yet hale  as  a tried warrior in  the  fulness  of  his strength.  He was the Lord  of  Rivendell and mighty among both Elves and Men.       In  the  middle of the table, against  the  woven cloths upon the wall,  there  was a chair under  a canopy, and there sat a lady fair to look  upon,  and so like was she in form of womanhood  to Elrond that Frodo  guessed that  she was one of his  close kindred. Young she was  and yet not so. The braids  of her dark  hair were touched  by no frost, her white arms and  clear  face  were  flawless and smooth,  and the light  of stars was in  her bright eyes,   grey as a cloudless night; yet queenly she looked, and thought and knowledge  were in  her  glance, as  of  one  who has known  many things that the years  bring. Above her brow her head was covered with  a cap of silver lace netted  with small gems, glittering white; but her soft grey raiment had no ornament  save a girdle of leaves wrought in silver.       So it was  that Frodo saw  her whom few  mortals  had yet seen;  Arwen,   daughter  of Elrond,  in whom it  was said  that the likeness of LÂ®thien had  come on earth again; and she was called  Undumiel, for she was  the Evenstar  of her people. Long she had been in the land of her mother's kin,  in Lurien  beyond  the mountains,  and  was  but  lately  returned to Rivendell  to her   father's  house.  But  her  brothers, Elladan and  Elrohir,  were  out  upon  errantry: for  they rode often far  afield with the  Rangers  of  the North,  forgetting never their mother's torment in the dens of the orcs.        Such loveliness  in  living  thing  Frodo had  never  seen  before  nor   imagined in his mind; and he was both surprised and abashed to find  that he  had a seat at  Elrond's table among all these  folk so high and fair. Though  he had a suitable chair, and was raised upon several  cushions, he felt very  small, and  rather out of place; but that  feeling quickly passed. The feast   was  merry and  the food all that his  hunger could desire. It was some time  before he looked about him again or even turned to his neighbours.       He  looked first for his friends. Sam had begged to be  allowed to wait  on his  master, but had been  told that  for this  time he  was  a  guest of  honour. Frodo could see him  now, sitting with Pippin and Merry at the upper   end  of  one of  the side-tables close to  the dais. He could see no sign of  Strider.   ####-     Next to Frodo  on his right sat a dwarf of important appearance, richly  dressed. His beard, very long and forked, was  white, nearly as white as the  snow-white cloth  of his garments. He wore a silver belt, and round his neck   hung a chain of silver and diamonds. Frodo stopped eating to look at him.       'Welcome  and well met!'  said the dwarf, turning towards  him. Then he  actually rose from his seat and bowed. `Gluin at your service,' he said, and  bowed still lower.       'Frodo  Baggins  at  your  service  and  your   family's,'  said  Frodo  correctly, rising  in surprise and scattering  his cushions."
