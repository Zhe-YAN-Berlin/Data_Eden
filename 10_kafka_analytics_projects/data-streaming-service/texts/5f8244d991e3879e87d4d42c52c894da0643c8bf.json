  "text": "' Then  he  gave Frodo his mithril-coat  and Sting, forgetting that he had  already done  so;  and  he gave him  also three books of lore that he had made  at various  times,  written  in  his spidery hand,  and labelled  on  their  red  backs:  Translations from the Elvish, by B.B.       To Sam he gave a little bag of gold. 'Almost the last drop of the Smaug  vintage,' he  said.  'May come in  useful,  if you think of getting married,  Sam.' Sam blushed.       'I have nothing  much to give to you young fellows,' he said   to  Merry  and Pippin, 'except  good advice.'  And when he had given them a fair sample  of  this, he added a last item in Shire-fashion:  'Don't let your heads  get  too big for  your hats! But  if you don't  finish growing  up soon,  you are  going to find hats and clothes expensive.'       'But if you want to  beat  the Old Took,' said Pippin, 'I don't see why  we shouldn't try and beat the Bullroarer.'       Bilbo laughed, and he produced out of a pocket two beautiful pipes with  pearl mouth-pieces and bound with fine-wrought silver.  'Think of me when you   smoke them!' he said. 'The  Elves made them for  me, but I don't smoke now.'  And then suddenly he nodded and went to sleep for a little; and when he woke  up again he said: 'Now where were we? Yes, of course, g iving presents. Which  reminds me: what's become of my ring, Frodo, that you took away?'       'I have lost it, Bilbo dear,' said Frodo. 'I got rid of it, you know.'       'What a  pity!' said  Bilbo. 'I should have liked to see  it again. But   ####-no, how silly  of me! That's what you went for, wasn't it: to get rid of it?   But it is all so confusing, for such a lot of  other things seem to have got  mixed  up  with it: Aragorn's affairs, and the White Council and Gondor, and  the Horsemen, and Southrons, and oliphaunts - did you really see one, Sam? -  and caves and towers and golden trees, and goodness knows what besides.       'I  evidently came  back  by much too straight a  road from my trip.  I  think Gandalf might have shown  me round  a bit. But then the  auction  would  have been  over  before I got back,  and I should have had even more trouble  than I  did. Anyway  it's  too  late  now; and really I think it's much more  comfortable to sit  here and hear about it all.  The fire's  very cosy here,  and the food's very good, and there are Elves when you want  them. What more  could one want?        The Road goes ever on and on        Out from the door where it began.       Now far ahead the Road has gone,       Let others follow it who can!       Let them a journey new begin,       But I at last with weary feet       Will turn towards the lighted inn,       My evening-rest and sleep to meet.'       And  as Bilbo murmured the last words his head dropped on his chest and  he slept soundly.       The evening deepened in the room,  and the  firelight  burned brighter;  and they looked at Bilbo  as he slept and saw that his face was smiling. For   some time they sat in silence; and then Sam  looking round  at  the room and  the shadows flickering on the walls, said softly:       'I don't think, Mr. Frodo, that he's done much writing while we've been  away. He won't ever write our story now.'       At that  Bilbo opened an eye, almost as if he had heard. Then he roused  himself. 'You see, I am getting so  sleepy,' he said. 'And when I have  time  to write, I only really like writing poetry. I wonder, Frodo my dear fellow,   if you  would very much mind  tidying things up a bit before you go? Collect  all my notes and  papers, and my diary too, and  take them with you, if  you   will. You see, I haven't much time for the selection and the arrangement and  all that.  Get Sam to help, and when you've knocked things into  shape, come  back, and I'll run over it. I won't be too critical.'       'Of course I'll do it!' said Frodo. 'And of course I'll come back soon:   ####-it won't be dangerous any  more. There  is a real king now and he  will soon  put the roads in order.'       'Thank  you, my dear fellow!' said Bilbo. 'That really is a  very great  relief to my mind.' And with that he fell fast asleep again.       The next day Gandalf and the hobbits took leave  of Bilbo  in his room,  for it was cold out of doors; and then they said farewell to Elrond  and all  his household.       As Frodo stood upon  the threshold, Elrond  wished him  a fair journey,  and blessed him, and he said:       'I think,  Frodo, that maybe you will not need to come back, unless you   come  very soon. For  about this time of the year, when the  leaves are gold  before they fall, look for Bilbo in  the woods of the Shire. I shall be with  him.'       These wor ds no one else heard, and Frodo kept them to himself.      ####-   Chapter 7. Homeward Bound            At last  the  hobbits had  their  faces  turned towards home. They were  eager now to see the  Shire again; but at first they  rode  only slowly, for   Frodo had been il l at  ease.  When they came to the  Ford of Bruinen, he had  halted, and seemed loth  to ride into the stream; and they  noted that for a   while his eyes appeared not to see them or things about him."
