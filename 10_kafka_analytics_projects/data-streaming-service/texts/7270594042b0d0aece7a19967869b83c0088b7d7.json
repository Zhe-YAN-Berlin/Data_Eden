It seemed too much to hope that the Riders had already  lost their  trail again. Perhaps  they  were waiting  to  make  some ambush in  a narrow  place?       At the end of  the fifth day the ground began once more  to rise slowly  out of the wide  shallow valley into which  they had  descended. Strider now   turned their course again north-eastwards, and on the sixth day they reached  the top of a long slow-climbing slope, and saw far  ahead a huddle of wooded  hills. Away below them they could see the Road sweeping round  the  feet  of  the hills;  and  to  their  right  a  grey river  gleamed  pale in the  thin  sunshine. In the  distance they glimpsed yet another river in a stony valley  half-veiled in mist.       \"I am  afraid we must  go back  to  the Road  here for  a while,'  said  Strider.  'We have  now  come to  the  River Hoarwell,  that the Elves  call  Mitheithel. It  flows down out  of the Ettenmoors, the troll-fells  north of  Rivendell,  and joins  the Loudwater away in the  South.  Some  call  it the  Greyflood after that. It is a great water before it finds the  Sea. There is  no way over  it  below  its sources  in the Ettenmoors, except by  the  Last    ####-Bridge on which the Road crosses.'       'What is that other river we can see far away there?' asked Merry.       'That is Loudwater,  the Bruinen of Rivendell,'  answered Strider. 'The  Road runs along the edge of  the hills for many miles from the Bridge to the  Ford of Bruinen. But I have  not yet thought how  we shall cross that water.  One river at a time! We shall be fortunate indeed if we do not find the Last   Bridge held against us.'       Next day, early in  the morning, they came down again to the borders of  the Road.  Sam  and  Strider  went  forward, but they found no  sign of  any  travellers or riders. Here under the shadow of the hills there had been some  rain. Strider judged that it had fallen two days before, and had washed away  all footprints. No horseman had passed since then, as far as he could see.       They hurried along with all the speed they could make, and after a mile  or two they saw the Last Bridge ahead, at the bottom of a short steep slope.  They dreaded  to see black figures waiting there, but they saw none. Strider  made them take cover  in a  thicket at  the side of the Road, while  he went  forward to explore.       Before long he came hurrying back. 'I can see no sign of the enemy,' he  said,  'and I wonder very much what that  means. But  I have found something  very strange.'       He held out his hand, and showed a single pale-green jewel. 'I found it  in  the  mud in  the  middle of the  Bridge,' he said. 'It  is  a beryl,  an  elf-stone.  Whether it was set  there, or  let fall by chance, I cannot say;  but  it brings  hope to  me. I will take it as a sign that we may  pass  the  Bridge; but beyond that I dare not keep  to  the Road, without some  clearer   token.'       At once they went on again. They crossed  the Bridge in safety, hearing  no sound  but  the water  swirling  against its three great  arches. A  mile  further on they came to a narrow ravine that led away northwards through the  steep  lands  on  the left of the Road.  Here Strider turned aside, and soon  they were lost in a sombre  country of dark trees winding among the feet  of  sullen hills.       The hobbits were glad  to leave  the  cheerless lands and the  perilous  Road behind them; but this new country seemed threatening and unfriendly. As  they went forward the hills about them steadily rose. Here  and  there  upon  heights  and ridges they caught glimpses of ancient walls  of stone, and the  ruins of towers: they had an ominous look. Frodo,  who was  not walking, had   ####-time to gaze ahead and to think. He recalled Bilbo's account of his  journey  and the  threatening towers on  the hills north of  the Road, in the country  near the Troll's wood where his first serious adventure had  happened. Frodo  guessed that they were  now in the  same  region, and wondered if by  chance  they would pass near the spot.       'Who lives  in this land?'  he asked.  'And  who built these  towers? Is  this troll-country?'       'No!' said Strider. 'Trolls do  not  build. No one lives in  this land.  Men once dwelt  here, ages ago;  but  none remain  now. They  became an evil  people, as legends  tell, for they fell under  the shadow of Angmar. But all  were destroyed  in the war that  brought the North Kingdom to  its  end. But  that is now so long ago that the hills  have forgotten them, though a shadow   still lies on the land.'       'Where  did you learn  such  tales,  if  all  the  land  is  empty  and  forgetful?' asked Peregrin. 'The  birds and beasts do not tell tales of that  son.'       'The  heirs  of Elendil do not forget all  things past,'  said Strider;  'and  many more things than  I can tell are remembered in  Rivendell."
