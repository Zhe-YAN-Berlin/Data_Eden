At first   they  talked,  or hummed a  tune  softly together, being  now far  away from  inquisitive ears. Then they marched  on in silence,  and Pippin began to lag  behind.  At  last, as  they began to   climb  a  steep slope, he  stopped and  yawned.       'I  am  so sleepy,' he said,  'that soon I shall fall down on the road.  Are you going to sleep on your legs? It is nearly midnight.'       'I thought you liked walking in the dark,' said Frodo. 'But there is no  great  hurry.  Merry expects  us some time the day after  tomorrow; but that  leaves us nearly two days more. We'll halt at the first likely spot.'       'The  wind's in  the West,' said Sam. 'If  we get to the other  side of  this hill,  we shall find  a spot  that  is  sheltered and snug  enough, sir.  There is  a dry fir-wood just ahead,  if  I  remember rightly.' Sam knew the  land well  within twenty miles of  Hobbiton, but that was  the  limit of his  geography.       Just  over the  top  of  the  hill they came on  the patch of fir-wood.  Leaving  the  road  they  went into  the deep resin -scented  darkness of the  trees, and  gathered  dead  sticks and cones to make a fire. Soon they had a   merry crackle of flame at the foot of a large fir-tree and they sat round it  for  a while, until they began to nod. Then, each in an  angle  of the great  tree's roots, they curled  up  in  their cloaks and blankets, and were  soon  fast asleep. They set no  watch; even Frodo feared  no danger yet,  for they  were still in  the heart  of the Shire. A few  creatures came and  looked at   ####-them when the fire had died away. A fox passing through the wood on business  of his own stopped several minutes and sniffed.       'Hobbits!' he thought. 'Well, what next? I have heard of strange doings  in this land,  but  I have  seldom  heard of a hobbit  sleeping out of doors  under a tree. Three of them! There's something mighty queer behind this.' He  was quite right, but he never found out any more about it.       The morning came,  pale and clammy. Frodo woke up first, and found that  a tree-root had made a hole in his back, and that his neck was stiff.       'Walking for pleasure! Why didn't  I drive?'  he thought, as he usually  did at the beginning of an expedition. 'And all  my  beautiful feather  beds  are sold to the Sackville-Bagginses! These  tree -roots would  do them good.'  He stretched. 'Wake up, hobbits!' he cried. It's a beautiful morning.'       'What's beautiful about it?' said Pippin, peering  over the edge of his  blanket with one eye. 'Sam! Gel breakfast ready for half-past nine! Have you  got the bath-water hot?'       Sam jumped up,  looking rather  bleary. 'No,  sir, I haven't, sir!'  he  said.       Frodo stripped the blankets from Pippin and  rolled him  over, and then  walked off to the edge of the wood. Away eastward the sun was rising red out  of the mists that lay thick  on  the world. Touched  with  gold and red  the  autumn trees seemed to  be sailing rootless in a shadowy sea. A little below  him to the left the road ran down steeply into a hollow and disappeared.       When  he returned  Sam  and  Pippin had got a good fire going. 'Water!'  shouted Pippin. 'Where's the water?'       'I  don't keep  water in my  pockets,' said  Frodo. 'We thought you had  gone to find  some,' said Pippin, busy  setting out the food, and cups. 'You   had better go now.'       'You  can come too,'  said  Frodo, 'and  bring  all the water -bottles.'  There was  a stream at the foot of the hill. They  filled their  bottles and  the small  camping kettle at a little fall  where the water fell  a few feet  over an outcrop  of grey stone. It  was  icy cold;  and they spluttered  and  puffed as they bathed their faces and hands.        When their breakfast was over, and their packs all trussed up again, it  was after  ten o'clock, and the day was beginning to turn fine and hot. They  went  down the slope, and across the stream where  it  dived under the road,   and up the next slope, and up and down another shoulder of the hills; and by  that time their cloaks, blankets, water , food, and other gear already seemed   ####-a heavy burden.       The day's march promised to be warm and tiring  work. After some miles,  however, the road  ceased to roll up and  down: it climbed  to the  top of a   steep bank in a weary zig-zagging sort of way, and then prepared to  go down  for  the last time. In front of  them they saw  the lower lands  dotted with  small clumps of  trees that melted away in  the distance to a brown woodland  haze. They were looking across the  Woody End towards  the Brandywine  River.  The road wound away before them like a piece of string.       'The road goes on  for ever,' said Pippin; 'but I can't without a rest.  It is  high time for lunch.' He sat down on the bank at the side of the road  and looked  away east into the haze, beyond which lay the River, and the end  of the Shire in which he had spent all his life."
