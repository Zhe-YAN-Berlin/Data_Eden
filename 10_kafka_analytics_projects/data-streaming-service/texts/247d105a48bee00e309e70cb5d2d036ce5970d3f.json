Their land  was originally unprotected from the East; but on  that side  they had built a hedge: the High Hay. It had been  planted many  generations  ago, and was now thick and  tail, for it  was constantly tended. It  ran all  the  way from Brandywine Bridge, in a big loop  curving away from the river,  to  Haysend  (where  the  Withywindle flowed  out  of  the Forest  into  the  Brandywine): well over twenty miles from end to  end. But, of course,  it was  not  a complete  protection.  The Forest  drew  close  to the hedge in  many  places.  The Bucklanders kept their doors locked after  dark,  and that also  was not usual in the Shire.       The  ferry-boat moved slowly  across the water. The Buckland shore drew  nearer. Sam was the only member of the party who had not been over the river   before. He had a strange feeling as the slow gurgling stream slipped by: his  old life lay behind  in the mists, dark adventure lay in front. He scratched  his head, and for a moment had a passing wish that Mr. Frodo could have gone  on living quietly at Bag End.       The four  hobbits stepped off the ferry.  Merry was  tying  it up,  and  Pippin  was already leading  the pony up the  path, when Sam  (who had  been  looking ba ck, as if to take farewell of the Shire) said in a hoarse whisper:       'Look back, Mr. Frodo! Do you see anything?'       On the far stage, under the distant lamps, they could just  make  out a   figure: it looked like a  dark black bundle left behind. But a s they  looked  it seemed to move and sway this way and that, as if searching the ground. It   then crawled, or went crouching, back into the gloom beyond the lamps.        'What in the Shire is that?' exclaimed Merry.       'Something that is following us,' said Frodo. 'But don't ask  any  more  now!  Let's get away  at once!' They hurried up the path to the top  of  the  bank,  but when  they  looked  back  the far shore was shrouded in mist, and  nothing could be seen.       'Thank goodness you don't keep any boats on the west -bank!' said Frodo.   'Can horses cross the river?'       'They  can go twenty miles north to Brandywine  Bridge - or they  might  swim,'  answered  Merry. 'Though  I  never heard of any horse  swimming  the   ####-Brandywine. But what have  horses to do with it?' I'll tell you later. Let's  get indoors and then we can talk.'       'All right! You and Pippin know your way; so I'll just ride on and tell  Fatty Bolger that you are coming. We'll see about supper and things.'       'We had our supper early with Farmer Maggot,' said Frodo;  'but we could  do with another.'       'You shall have it! Give  me that basket!' said  Merry, and  rode ahead  into the darkness.        It  was some distance from  the  Brandywine  to  Frodo's new  house  at  Crickhollow. They passed Buck Hill and Brandy Hall on their left, and on the  outskirts of Bucklebury struck the main road of Buckland that ran south from  the Bridge. Half a mile northward  along this they came to a lane opening on   their  right. This they followed for a couple of miles as it  climbed up and  down into the country.       At last  they  came to a narrow gate in a thick hedge. Nothing could be  seen  of the house in the dark: it stood back from the lane in the middle of  a wide  circle of  lawn surrounded by  a belt of  low trees inside the outer   hedge. Frodo had chosen it, because it stood in an  out-of-the-way corner of  the country, and there were  no other dwellings close  by.  You could get in  and out  without being noticed. It had been built a long while before by the  Brandybucks, for the use  of guests, or members of the family that wished to  escape  from  the  crowded  life  of  Brandy  Hall  for a  time.  It  was an  old-fashioned  countrified house, as much like a hobbit -hole as possible: it  was long and low,  with no  upper storey; and it had a roof  of  turf, round  windows, and a large round door.       As they walked lip the green path  from  the gate no light was visible;  the  windows  were dark and shuttered.  Frodo knocked on the door, and Fatty  Bolger opened it . A friendly light streamed out. They slipped in quickly and  shut themselves and the light inside. They were in a wide hall with doors on  either side; in  front  of them a  passage ran back  down the  middle of the  house.       'Well, what do you think of it?' asked Merry coming up the passage. 'We  have  done our  best in  a short time to make it  look  like home. After all  Fatty and I only got here with the last cart-load yesterday.'       Frodo looked  round.  It did  look like home. Many of his own favourite  things -  or Bilbo's things (they  reminded  him sharply of him in their new  selling) - were arranged as nearly as possible as they had been  at Bag End.   ####-It  was  a  pleasant,  comfortable,  welcoming  place;  and he found himself  wishing  that he was really coming  here to settle down in quiet retirement."
