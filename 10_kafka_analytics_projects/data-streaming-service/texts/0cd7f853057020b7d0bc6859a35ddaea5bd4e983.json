Herbs  we can manage, seemingly.'       `Gollum!'  he  called softly. `Third  time pays  for all. I  want  some  herbs.' Gollum's head peeped out of the  fern,  but  his looks  were neither   helpful  nor friendly.  `A few  bay-leaves, some  thyme and sage, will do  --  before the water boils,' said Sam.       `No! ' said  Gollum. `Smjagol is  not pleased. And Smjagol doesn't like  smelly leaves. He doesn't eat  grasses or roots,  no precious, not till he's  starving or very sick, poor Smjagol. '   ####-     `Smjagol'll get  into real true hot water , when this water boils, if he  don't do  as  he's  asked,' growled  Sam.  `Sam'll put  his head in it,  yes  precious. And I'd make him look for turnips  and carrots, and taters too, if  it was  the time o'  the  year. I'll bet there's all sorts  of  good  things  running wild in this country. I'd give a lot for half a dozen taters.'       `Smjagol won't  go, O no precious, not this time,' hissed Gollum. `He's  frightened, and  he's very tired, and this hobbit's  not nice,  not nice  at  all.  Smjagol won't  grub for roots and  carrotses  and  --  taters.  What's  taters, precious, eh, what's taters?        `Po-ta -toes,' said Sam. 'The  Gaffer's delight, and  rare  good ballast   for an empty belly. But you won't find any, so you needn't look. But be good   Smjagol  and  fetch me the herbs, and I'll think better of you. What's more,  if you turn  over a new leaf, and keep it turned, I'll cook you  some taters  one of  these days. I will: fried fish  and chips served by  S.  Gamgee. You   couldn't say no to that.'       `Yes, yes we could. Spoiling nice fish, scorching it. Give me fish now,  and keep nassty chips! '       `Oh you're hopeless,' said Sam. 'Go to sleep!'       In  the end he had to find what  he wanted for himself;  but he did not  have to  go far, not out  of sight of the  place where his master lay, still  sleeping. For a while  Sam sat musing, and  tending the fire till  the water   boiled. The daylight grew  and the  air became  warm; the dew faded off turf  and leaf. Soon  the  rabbits  cut  up  lay simmering in their pans with  the  bunched herbs. Almost Sam fell asleep as the  time went by. He let them stew  for close on an hour, testing them now and again with  his fork, and tasting  the broth.       When  he thought  all  was ready he lifted the pans off  the  fire, and  crept along to Frodo. Frodo  half opened his eyes as Sam stood over him, and  then he  wakened from  his  dreaming: another gentle, unrecoverable dream of  peace.       `Hullo, Sam! ' he said. `Not resting? Is  anything wrong?  What  is the  time?  '       `About a couple of hours after daybreak,' said  Sam, `and  nigh on half  past  eight  by  Shire  clocks, maybe. But nothing's wrong. Though  it ain't   quite what I'd call right: no stock, no onions, no taters. I've got a bit of  a stew for you, and some broth, Mr. Frodo.  Do you good. You'll have  to sup  it in your mug; or straight from the pan, when it's  cooled a bit. I haven't    ####-brought no bowls, nor nothing proper.'       Frodo  yawned and stretched.  'You  should  have been  resting Sam,' he  said. 'And lighting   a fire  was dangerous  in these  parts.  But I do  feel  hungry. Hmm! Can I smell it from here? What have you stewed? '       'A  present from Smjagol,' said Sam: `a brace o' young coneys; though I  fancy Gollum's regretting them now. But there's nought to go with them but a  few herbs.'       Sam and  his master sat just within  the  fern-brake and ate their stew  from the pans, sharing the  old fork and spoon. They allowed themselves half  a piece of the Elvish waybread each. It seemed a feast.       'Wheew!  Gollum! ' Sam called and whistled softly. 'Come on! Still time  to  change your  mind.  There's some left, if you want to try stewed coney.'  There was no answer.       `Oh  well, I suppose he's gone off to find something for himself. We'll  finish it,' said Sam.       `And then you must take some sleep,' said Frodo.       `Don't you drop off, while  I'm nodding, Mr. Frodo. I  don't  feel  too  sure  of  him.  There's  a  good  deal  of  Stinker -the bad  Gollum, if  you   understand me-in him still, and it's getting stronger again. Not but what  I  think he'd try to throttle  me first  now. We don't see eye to eye, and he's  not pleased with Sam, O no precious, not pleased at all.'       They finished, and Sam went off to the stream to rinse his  gear. As he  stood  up to return, he looked back up the  slope. At that moment he saw the  sun  rise out of the reek, or haze, or dark shadow, or whatever it was, that  lay  ever to the east, and it sent its  golden beams down upon the trees and  glades about him. Then  he noticed a thin spiral of blue-grey,  smoke, plain  to see as it  caught  the sunlight, rising  from a thicket above him."
