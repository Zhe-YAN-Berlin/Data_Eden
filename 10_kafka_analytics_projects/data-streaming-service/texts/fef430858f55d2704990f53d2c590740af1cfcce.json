So they  talked  until the  sun  reached  its height, and suddenly  the  noon-bells were rung, and there was a  stir in the citadel; for all save the  watchmen were going to their meal.       'Will you come with me?' said Beregond. 'You may join my  mess for this  day. I do not know to  what  company  you will be  assigned; or the Lord may  hold you at his own command. But you will be welcome. And it will be well to  meet as many men as you may, while there is yet time.'       'I shall be glad  to come,' said Pippin. 'I am  lonely, to tell you the  truth. I left my best friend behind in Rohan, and I have had  no one to talk   to  or jest with. Perhaps  I could  really join your  company?  Are  you the   captain? If so, you could take me on, or speak for me?'       'Nay, nay,' Beregond laughed, 'I am no captain. Neither office nor rank   nor lordship  have I,  being but a plain man of arms of the Third Company of  the Citadel. Yet, Master Peregrin, to be only a man of arms of the  Guard of  the Tower of Gondor  is held worthy in the City, and such men have honour in  the land.'       'Then it is far beyond me,' said Pippin. 'Take me back to our room, and  if Gandalf is not there, I will go where you like  - as your guest. '       Gandalf was not in the lodging and had sent no message; so  Pippin went   with Beregond and was made known  to  the  men of the  Third Company. And  it  seemed that Beregond got as much honour from it as his guest, for Pippin was  very welcome.  There  had  already  been  much talk  in  the  citadel  about  Mithrandir's companion and his  long  closeting with the  Lord;  and  rumour  declared that a Prince  of the Halflings had  come out of the North to offer   allegiance to Gondor and five  thousand  swords.  And some said that when the   ####-Riders came from Rohan each would bring behind him a halfling warrior, small  maybe, but doughty.       Though Pippin had regretfully to destroy this  hopeful  tale,  he could  not be rid of his new  rank, only fitting, men thought, to one befriended by  Boromir and honoured by  the Lord Denethor; and they thanked him for   coming  among them, and  hung on his words and stories of the outlands, and gave him  as much food and ale as he could  wish. Indeed his  only  trouble was to  be  'wary' according  to the counsel of Gandalf, and  not to let  his tongue wag  freely after the manner of a hobbit among friends.       At length  Beregond  rose. 'Farewell for  this time!'  he said. 'I have  duty now till sundown, as have all the others here, I think. But if you  are  lonely, as you  say, maybe  you would like a  merry guide about the City. My  son would go with you gladly. A good lad, I may say. If that pleases you, go  down to  the  lowest  circle and ask for  the Old  Guesthouse  in  the  Rath  Celerdain, the Lampwrights' Street. You will find him  there with other lads  that are remaining in the City. There may be things worth seeing down at the  Great Gate ere the closing.'       He went out, and soon after all the  others followed. The day was st ill  fine, though  it  was  growing hazy,  and it was  hot for March, even so far  southwards. Pippin felt sleepy,  but  the  lodging seemed cheerless, and  he  decided to go down and  explore the City. He took a few morsels that he  had  saved to Shadowfax,  and  they were  graciously accepted,  though the  horse  seemed to have no lack. Then he walked on down many winding ways.        People  stared  much  as  he  passed. To  his  face  men  were  gravely  courteous, saluting him after the manner of Gondor with bowed head and hands  upon the breast; but  behind him he heard many calls,  as those out of doors  cried to others within  to come  and see the Prince  of the  Halflings,  the  companion of Mithrandir. Many used some other tongue than the Common  Speech,  but  it  was not long before he  learned at least what was meant by  Ernil i  Pheriannath  and knew that his title had gone down before him into the City.       He came at last by arched streets and many fair alleys and pavements to  the lowest and widest circle, a nd there  he was directed to the Lampwrights'  Street, a broad way running towards  the  Great Gate. In it he found the Old  Guesthouse, a large building of grey weathered stone with  two wings running   ####-back from the street, and between them a narrow greensward, behind which  was  the many-windowed house, fronted along its whole  width by  a pillared porch  and  a flight of steps down on  to  the grass.  Boys were playing  among the  pillars,  the only children  that Pippin had  seen  in Minas Tirith,  and he  stopped to look at them. Presently one of them caught sight of him, and with  a  shout  he sprang across  the grass and  came into the street, followed by  several others. There he stood in front of Pippin, looking him up and down."
