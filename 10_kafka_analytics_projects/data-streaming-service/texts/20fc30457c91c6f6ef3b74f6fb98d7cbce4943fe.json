Whence they came none knew, but they went up the stony road and  vanished  into the hill, as if they went to keep a tryst.'       'Then why  has Aragorn  gone that  way?'  asked Merry. 'Don't you  know  anything that would explain it?'       'Unless  he has  spoken  words  to  you as his friend that we  have not  heard,'  said  Jomer,  'none now  in  the land of the  living  can tell  his  purpose.'       'Greatly  changed he seemed to  me since I saw him first  in the king's  house,' said Jowyn: 'grimmer, older.  Fey I thought  him, and  like one whom  the Dead call.'       'Maybe  he was called,' said  Thjoden;  'and my  heart  tells me that I  shall  not see him again.  Yet he is a kingly man of high  destiny. And take  comfort in this,  daughter, since comfort you seem to need in your grief for   this guest.  It is said  that  when the Eorlingas  came out of the North and  passed  at length up the  Snowbourn, seeking strong places of refuge in time  of need, Brego and his son Baldor climbed the Stair of the  Hold and so came  before  the Door.  On  the threshold sat an  old man, aged beyond  guess  of  years; tall and kingly he had been, but now he was withered as an old stone.   Indeed for stone they took him, for he moved not, and he said no word, until  they sought to pass him  by and enter. And then a  voice came out of him, as  it were out  of  the ground,  and  to  their amaze  it spoke in  the western  tongue: The way is shut.       'Then they halted and looked at him and saw that he lived still; but he  did not  look at them.  The way is shut, his voice said again It was made by  those who  are Dead,  and the Dead keep it, until the time comes. The way is   shut.       'And  when  will that time be? said Baldor. But  no answer  did he ever   get. For the old man died in that hour  and fell upon his face; and no other   tidings of the ancient dwellers in the mountains have our folk ever learned.   ####-Yet maybe at last the time foretold has come, and Aragorn may pass.'       'But how  shall a man discover whether that time be come or no, save by  daring the Door?' said  Jomer. 'And that way  I would not go  though all the  hosts of Mordor stood before me, and  I were alone and had no other  refuge.  Alas that a fey mood should  fall  on a  man so greathearted in this hour of  need! Are there not evil things enough abroad without seeking them under the  earth? War is at hand.'       He  paused, for at that moment there was a noise outside, a man's voice  crying the name of Thjoden, and the challenge of the guard.       Presently the captain of the Guard thrust aside the curtain. 'A  man is  here, lord,' he  said, 'an errand-rider of Gondor. He wishes to come  before  you at once.'       'Let him come!' said Thjoden.       A tall man entered, and Merry choked back a cry; for a moment it seemed  to him that Boromir was alive  again and  had returned. Then he saw  that it  was not so; the man was a stranger, though as like  to Boromir as if he were  one of his kin, tall and grey-eyed  and proud. He was clad as a rider with a   cloak of  dark  green over a coat of fine mail; on the front of his helm was  wrought  a  small  silver  star.  In  his  hand  he  bore  a  single  arrow,  black-feathered and barbed with steel, but the point was painted red.       He sank on one knee and  presented the  arrow to Thjoden. 'Hail Lord of  the  Rohirrim, friend  of Gondor!' he said.  'Hirgon I  am,  errand-rider of  Denethor,  who bring you this token  of  war. Gondor is in great need. Often  the Rohirrim have  aided us,  but now the  Lord  Denethor asks for  all your  strength and all your speed; lest Gondor fall at last.'       'The  Red  Arrow!' said  Thjoden, holding  it, as  one  who receives  a   summons  long expected and  yet  dreadful  when it comes. His hand trembled.  'The Red  Arrow has not been seen in the Mark in all my years! Has it indeed  come  to that? And what does the Lord Denethor reckon that  all  my strength  and all my speed may be?'       'That is best known  to yourself,  lord,' said Hirgon. 'But ere long it  may  well come to pass that Minas Tirith is surrounded,  and unless you have  the strength to  break a siege of many powers, the Lord Denethor bids me say  that he judges that the  strong arms of the Rohirrim would  be better within  his walls than without.'       'But he knows that we are a people  who fight rather upon horseback and  in  the open, and that we are also a scattered people and time is needed for    ####-the gathering of our Riders.  Is it not true, Hirgon, that the Lord of Minas  Tirith knows more than he sets in his message? For we are already at war, as  you may have seen, and you do not find us all  unprepared. Gandalf the  Grey  has been among us, and even now we are mustering for battle in the Ea st.'       'What  the Lord Denethor may know or guess of all these things I cannot   say,' answered Hirgon."
