This  was  the stronghold of  Saruman, as  fame reported it; for within  living memory the men of Rohan had not passed its gates, save perhaps a few,   such as Wormtongue, who came in secret and told no man what they saw.        Now Gandalf rode to the great pillar of the Hand, and passed it: and as  he did so the Riders  saw to  their wonder that  the Hand appeared no longer   white. It was stained as with dried blood; and looking closer they perceived   ####-that its  nails were red.  Unheeding  Gandalf rode  on  into  the mist,  and  reluctantly  they followed him. All about them now,  as if  there had been a   sudden flood.  wide pools of water lay beside the road, filling the hollows.   and rills went trickling down among the stones.        At last Gandalf  halted  and beckoned to them; and they  came, and  saw  that beyond him  the mists  had cleared, and a pale sunlight shone. The hour   of noon had passed. They were come to the doors of Isengard.       But the  doors lay  hurled and twisted  on the ground.  And  all about,  stone, cracked  and  splintered into  countless jagged shards, was scattered  far and wide, or piled in ruinous heaps. The great arch  still stood, but it  opened now upon a roofless chasm: the tunnel was laid bare.  and through the  cliff-like walls  on  either side great  rents  and  breaches had been torn;  their towers were beaten into  dust. If the Great Sea had risen in wrath and  fallen on the hills with storm. it could ha ve worked no greater ruin.       The ring beyond was filled with steaming water: a bubbling cauldron, in  which  there heaved  and floated  a wreckage of beams and  spars, chests and  casks and broken  gear. Twisted and leaning pillars reared their  splintered  stems above the  flood. but all the roads were drowned. Far off, it  seemed,  half veiled in  winding cloud, there loomed the  island rock. Still dark and  tall, unbroken by the storm,  the tower of Orthanc stood. Pale waters lapped   about its feet.       The  king and all his company  sat silent on  their horses, marvelling,  perceiving  that the power of Saruman was overthrown; but how they could not  guess.  And  now they turned their eyes towards the archway  and  the ruined  gates. There they  saw close  beside  them a great rubble-heap; and suddenly  they were aware  of two small figures  lying on it at their ease, grey-clad,  hardly  to  be seen  among  the  stones. There were  bottles and  bowls  and  platters  laid beside them, as if  they had just eaten  well, and now rested  from their labour. One seemed asleep; the other, with crossed legs  and arms  behind his head,  leaned  back against a broken rock and sent from his mouth  long wisps and little rings of thin blue smoke.       For  a  moment Thjoden  and Jomer  and all  his men  stared at  them in  wonder.  Amid all the  wreck  of Isengard  this seemed to them the strangest   sight.  But  before the king could speak,  the  small smoke-breathing figure  became suddenly aware of them, as they sat there silent  on the edge of  the  mist. He sprang to his feet. A young man he looked, or like one, though  not   much  more than half a man  in height; his head  of  brown curling hair  was   ####-uncovered,  but he was  clad in a  travel-stained cloak of the same  hue and  shape a s the companions  of Gandalf had worn when  they rode  to Edoras.  He  bowed very low. putting  his  hand upon  his breast.  Then,  seeming not  to  observe the wizard and his friends, he turned to Jomer and the king.       'Welcome, my lords,  to  Isengard!' he said. 'We  are  the doorwardens.  Meriadoc,  son  of  Saradoc  is  my  name; and my  companion, who,  alas! is  overcome with  weariness'  -- here he gave the other a dig with  his  foot --  'is Peregrin, son of Paladin, of the house of Took. Far in the North  is our  home. The Lord Saruman  is within; but at the moment he is closeted with one  Wormtongue,  or  doubtless  he  would be here  to  welcome  such  honourable  guests.'       'Doubtless he would!' laughed Gandalf. 'And was it Saruman that ordered  you to  guard his  damaged  doors, and watch for the arrival of guests, when  your attention could be spared from plate and bottle?'       'No, good sir, the matter escaped him,' answered Merry gravely 'He  has  been much occupied. Our orders came from Treebeard, who  has taken  over  the  management of Isengard. He  commanded me to  welcome  the Lord of Rohan  with  fitting words."
