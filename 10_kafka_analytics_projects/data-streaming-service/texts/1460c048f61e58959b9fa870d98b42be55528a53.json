The sound  of her footsteps was like a stream falling   ####-gently away downhill over cool stones in the quiet of night.       Tom sat on a while beside  them in silence, while each of them tried to  muster the courage to ask  one of the many questions he had meant to  ask at  supper. Sleep gathered on their eyelids. At last Frodo spoke:       'Did  you  hear me calling, Master, or was  it just chance that brought  you at that moment?'       Tom stirred like a man shaken out of a pleasant dream. 'Eh, what?' said  he. 'Did I  hear you calling?  Nay, I did not hear: I was busy singing. Just   chance brought  me then,  if  chance  you call it.  It was no  plan of mine,  though I was waiting  for you.  We heard  news of you,  and learned that you  were wandering. We guessed you'd come ere long down to the water:  all paths  lead  that  way, down to  Withywindle. Old grey  Willow-man, he's  a  mighty  singer; and it's hard for little folk to escape  his cunning mazes.  But Tom  had an errand there, that he dared not hinder.' Tom  nodded as if sleep  was  taking him again; but he went on in a soft singing voice:       I had an errand there: gathering water-lilies,       green leaves and lilies white to please my pretty lady,       the last ere the year's end to keep them from the winter,       to flower by her pretty feet tilt the snows are melted.       Each year at summer's end I go to find them for her,       in a wide pool, deep and clear, far down Withywindle;       there they open first in spring and there they linger latest.       By that pool long ago I found the River-daughter,       fair young Goldberry sitting in the rushes.       Sweet was her singing then, and her heart was beating!       He opened his eyes and looked at them with a sudden glint of blue:       And that proved well for you -- for now I shall no longer       go down deep again along the forest-water,       not while the year is old. Nor shall I be passing       Old Man Willow's house this side of spring-time,       not till the merry spring, when the River-daughter       dances down the withy-path to bathe in the water.       He  fell  silent  again;  but  Frodo  could  not help asking  one  more  question: the one he most desired to have answered.  'Tell  us, Master,'  he  said, 'about the Willow-man. What is he? I have never heard of him before.'       'No, don't!' said Merry and  Pippin together, sitting suddenly upright.  'Not now! Not until the morning!'   ####-     'That is right!' said the old man.  'Now  is the time for resting. Some  things  are  ill  to hear  when  the  world's  in  shadow.  Sleep  till  the  morning-light, rest on  the  pillow! Heed no nightly  noise!  Fear  no  grey  willow!' And with that he took down the lamp and blew it out, and grasping a  candle in either hand he led them out of the room.       Their mattresses and  pillows were soft as down, and  the blankets were  of white  wool. They had hardly laid  themselves on the deep beds and  drawn  the light covers over them before they were asleep.       In the dead night, Frodo lay  in a dream without light. Then he saw the  young moon rising; under its thin light there loomed before him a black wall  of  rock, pierced by a  dark arch like a great gate. It seemed to Frodo that  he was lifted up, and passing over he saw that the rock -wall was a circle of  hills, and that within it was a plain, and in the midst of the plain stood a   pinnacle of stone, like a vast tower but not made by hands. On its top stood  the figure of  a man. The moon as it rose seemed to hang for a  moment above  his head and glistened in his white hair as the wind stirred it. Up from the  dark plain below came the crying  of fell voices, and  the  howling of  many   wolves. Suddenly  a shadow, like the shape of great wings, passed across the  moon. The figure lifted his arms and a  light flashed from the staff that he  wielded. A mighty ea gle  swept down and bore him away. The voices wailed  and  the wolves yammered. There was a noise like a strong wind blowing, and on it  was borne the sound of hoofs, galloping, galloping, galloping from the East.   'Black Riders!'  thought  Frodo as  he wakened, with the  sound of the hoofs  still  echoing in his  mind.  He wondered if  he would ever  again  have the  courage to leave the safety  of these stone walls. He lay  motionless, still  listening;  but all  was now silent, and  at last he turned and fell  asleep  again or wandered into some other unremembered dream.       At his side Pippin lay dreaming pleasantly;  but a change came over his  dreams and he turned and groaned. Suddenly he woke, or thought he had  waked,  and yet still heard in the darkness the sound that had disturbed his  dream:  tip-tap,  squeak:  the  noise  was  like  branches  fretting  in  the  wind,  twig-fingers scraping  wall and window: creak, creak, creak. He wondered  if  there were  willow-trees close  to  the  house; and  then suddenly he  had a   dreadful feeling that he was not in an ordinary house at all, but inside the  willow and listening  to that horrible dry  creaking  voice laughing  at him   ####-again."
