I have  thought several  times of  going back to Hobbiton for it; but I am getting old, and they  would not let  me: Gandalf and Elrond,  I  mean.  They seemed  to  think that the Enemy was  looking high and low for me, and would make mincemeat of me, if he caught  me  tottering about in the Wild.       'And Gandalf said: \"The Ring has passed on,  Bilbo. It would do no good  to  you or to others, if you tried to meddle  with it  again.\" Odd  sort  of  remark,  just like Gandalf. But he said he was looking after  you, so I  let  things be. I am frightfully glad to  see  you safe and sound.' He paused and  looked at Frodo doubtfully.       `Have  you got it here?' he asked  in a whisper. `I  ca n't help feeling  curious,  you know, after all I've heard. I  should very much like  just  to  peep at it again.'       `Yes, I've  got  it,' answered Frodo, feeling a strange reluctance. `It  looks just the same as ever it did.'       `Well, I should just lik e to see it for a moment,' said Bilbo.       When he had dressed, Frodo found  that while he slept the Ring had been  hung about his neck on a new chain, light but strong. Slowly he drew it out.  Bilbo  put  out  his hand.  But Frodo  quickly drew  back the Ring.  To  his  distress  and  amazement he found that he was no  longer looking at Bilbo; a   shadow seemed to  have fallen between them, and through it he found  himself  eyeing a little wrinkled creature with a hungry face and bony groping hands.   He felt a desire to strike him.       The music  and singing round them seemed  to falter and a silence fell.  Bilbo looked quickly at Frodo's face and passed his hand across his eyes. `I   understand  now,' he said. `Put it away! I am sorry: sorry you have  come in  for this burden: sorry about everything.  Don't adventures ever have an end?   I suppose not. Someone else always has to carry on the story. Well, it can't   be helped. I wonder if it's any good  trying  to finish my  book? But  don't  let's  worry about it now-let 's have some real News! Tell  me all about  the  Shire!'       Frodo hid the Ring away, and the shadow passed leaving hardly  a  shred   ####-of  memory.  The light  and music  of  Rivendell was about  him again. Bilbo  smiled  and laughed happily. Every  item  of news  from the Shire that Frodo  could  tell-aided and corrected now and again  by  Sam-was  of the  greatest   interest to  him, from the felling of  the least tree to the  pranks of  the  smallest child  in  Hobbiton. They were so deep in  the doings  of  the Four  Farthings that they did not  notice  the arrival of a man clad in dark green  cloth. For many minutes he stood looking down at them with a smile.       Suddenly  Bilbo  looked  up. 'Ah, there you are  at last,  D®nadan!' he  cried.       `Strider!' said Frodo. `You seem to have a lot of names.'       `Well, Strider is one that I haven't heard before, anyway,' said Bilbo.  `What do you call him that for?'       `They call me that in Bree,' said Strider laughing, 'and that is how  I  was introduced to him.'       `And why do you call him D®nadan?' asked Frodo.       `The D®nadan,' said Bilbo. `He is often called that here. But I thought  you  knew  enough  Elvish  at  least to  know  d®n-udan: Man  of  the  West,  N®menorean. But this is not the time for lessons!' He turned to Strider.       `Where have you been, my friend? Why weren't you at the feast? The Lady  Arwen was there.'       Strider looked down at Bilbo gravely. `I  know,'  he said. 'But often I  must put  mirth aside. Elladan  and Elrohir  have returned  out  of the Wild  unlooked-for, and they had tidings that I wished to hear at once.'       `Well, my  dear fellow,' said  Bilbo, `now you've heard the news, can't   you spare me  a moment?  I want your help in  something urgent.  Elrond says  this song of mine is to be finished  before the end of the evening, and I am  stuck. Let's go off into a corner and polish it up!'       Strider smiled. `Come then!' he said. `Let me hear it!'       Frodo  was left  to himself  for a while. for Sam had fallen asleep. He  was  alone and felt rather forlorn`  although  all  about  him  the  folk of  Rivendell were gathered. But  those near  him were silent,  intent upon  the  music of the voices and the instruments. and they  gave no heed to  anything  else. Frodo began to listen.       At first the beauty of the  melodies  and  of  the interwoven  words in  elven-tongues, even though he understood  them little` held him in  a spell,  as soon as  he began to attend to them. Almost it seemed that the words took   shape, and  visions of  far la nds  and  bright things that he had  never yet   ####-imagined  opened out before him;  and the firelit  hall became like a golden  mist above seas of foam that sighed upon the margins of the  world. Then the  enchantment  became more and more dreamlike, until  he  felt  that an endless  river of  swelling gold  and  silver was flowing over him, too multitudinous  for its  pattern to be comprehended;  it  became part of  the throbbing  air  about him, and  it  drenched and  drowned him."
