  "text": " You have  wisely kept that ring secret all these  years, and it  seemed to me necessary to give your guests something else that would seem to  explain your sudden vanishment.'       'And would spoil my joke. You are an interfering old busybody,' laughed  Bilbo, 'but I expect you know best, as usual.'       'I do - when I  know  anything. But I  don't  feel too  sure about this  whole affair. It has now come  to the  final point. You have had  your joke,  and alarmed or offended most  of your relations, and  given the whole  Shire  something to talk about for nine  days, or ninety-nine more  likely. Are you   going any further?'       'Yes, I am. I feel  I  need a holiday, a very  long holiday, as I  have  told  you before. Probably  a  permanent holiday:  I  don't expect  I  shall  return. In fact, I don't mean to, and I have made all arrangements.       'I  am  old, Gandalf. I don't look it, but I am beginning to feel it in  my heart  of hearts.  Well-preserved indeed!' he snorted.  'Why, I feel  all  thin, sort of stretched, if you  know what I mean: like butter that has been  scraped  over too  much bread.  That can't  be right. I need  a  change,  or    ####-something.'       Gandalf  looked curiously  and closely at him.  'No,  it does not  seem  right,' he said thoughtfully. 'No, after all I believe your plan is probably  the best.'       'Well, I've made  up  my mind,  anyway. I  want to see mountains again,  Gandalf, mountains, and then  find somewhere where I can  rest. In peace and  quiet, without a lot  of relatives prying around, and a string of confounded  visitors hanging on the bell.  I might find somewhere where I  can finish my  book. I  have thought  of  a nice ending for it:  and he lived happily  ever  after to the end of his days. '       Gandalf laughed. I hope he will. But nobody will read the book, however   it ends.'       'Oh, they may, in years to come. Frodo has read some already, as far as  it has gone. You'll keep an eye on Frodo, won't you?'       'Yes, I will  - two eyes, as often as I can spare them.'       'He would come with  me, of  course, if I asked him. In fact he offered  to once, just before the party. But he does not really want to, yet.  I want  to  see  the  wild country again before I die, and  the Mountains; but he is  still in love with the Shire, with woods and  fields  and  little rivers. He  ought to  be comfortable here. I  am leaving everything  to him,  of course,  except a few oddments. I  hope he will be happy,  when he gets used to being  on his own. It's time he was his own master now.'       'Everything?' said Gandalf. 'The ring  as well? You agreed to that, you   remember.'       'Well, er, yes, I suppose so,' stammered Bilbo.        'Where is it?'       'In an envelope, if you must know,'  said Bilbo impatiently. 'There  on  the mantelpiece. Well,  no! Here it is in  my  pocket!' He hesitated.  'Isn't  that odd now?'  he  said  softly  to himself. 'Yet after all,  why  not? Why  shouldn't it stay there?'       Gandalf looked again very hard  at  Bilbo, and there was a gleam in his  eyes.  'I think, Bilbo,' he said  quietly, 'I should leave  it behind. Don't   you want to?'       'Well yes  - and no. Now it comes to it, I don't like parting with it at  all, I may say. And I don't really see why I should. Why do you want me to?'  he asked, and a  curious  change came  over  his voice.  It  was sharp  with   ####-suspicion and annoyance. 'You are always badgering me about my ring; but  you  have never bothered me about the other things that I got on my journey.'       'No, but I had to  badger  you,'  said Gandalf. 'I wanted the truth. It  was  important. Magic  rings  are  - well, magical; and  they are  rare  and  curious. I was  professionally interested in  your ring, you may say;  and I  still am. I should like to know where it is, if you go wandering again. Also  I  think you  have had  it quite long  enough. You won't need it  any  more.  Bilbo, unless I am quite mistaken.'       Bilbo  flushed, and there  was an angry light in  his eyes.  His kindly  face  grew hard. 'Why  not?'  he  cried. 'And what business is it of  yours,  anyway, to know what I  do with my own things? It is my own. I found  it. It   came to me.'       'Yes, yes,' said Gandalf. 'But there is no need to get angry.'       'If I am  it  is your  fault,' said Bilbo. 'It is mine, I  tell you. My  own. My precious. Yes, my precious.'       The wizard's face remained grave and attentive,  and  only a flicker in  his deep eyes showed that he  was startled and indeed  alarmed. 'It has been  called that before,' he said,  'but not by you.'       'But I say it now. And why not? Even if Gollum said the same once. It's  not his now, but mine. And I shall keep it, I say.'       Gandalf stood  up. He  spoke  sternly. 'You will be  a fool if  you do.  Bilbo,' he said. 'You make that clearer with every word you say. It has  got  far  too much  hold on you. Let it go! And then you can go yourself, and  be  free."
