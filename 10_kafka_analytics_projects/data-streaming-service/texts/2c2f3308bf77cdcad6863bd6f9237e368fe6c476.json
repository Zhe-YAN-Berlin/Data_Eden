'All your long life we have  been  friends, and you owe me something. Come!  Do as you promised: give  it  up!  '       'Well,  if  you  want my ring yourself, say  so!' cried Bilbo. 'But you   won't get it.  I won't give my precious away, I tell  you.' His hand strayed  to the hilt of his small sword.       Gandalf's eyes flashed. It will be my turn to get angry soon,' he said.  If  you  say  that again,  I shall.  Then  you  will  see Gandalf  the  Grey  uncloaked.'  He took a step towards the hobbit,  and he seemed to  grow tall  and menacing; his shadow filled the little room.       Bilbo backed away  to the  wall, brea thing hard, his hand  clutching at   ####-his pocket. They stood for a while facing one another,  and the  air of  the  room tingled. Gandalf's  eyes remained bent on the hobbit. Slowly  his hands  relaxed, and he began to tremble.       'I  don't know  what has  come  over  you, Gandalf,' he said. 'You have  never been like this  before. What is it all  about? It is mine isn't it?  I  found it, and Gollum would  have killed  me, if I hadn't kept it. I'm not  a   thief, whatever he said.'       'I have  never called  you  one,' Gandalf answered. 'And  I  am not one  either. I am not trying to rob you,  but to help you. I wish you would trust   me,  as  you  used.' He turned  away, and the  shadow  passed. He  seemed to  dwindle again to an old grey man, bent and troubled.       Bilbo drew his hand over his eyes. I am sorry,' he said. 'But I felt so  queer.  And yet it would be a relief in a way not to be bothered with it any  more. It has been so growing on my mind lately. Sometimes I have felt it was  like an eye  looking at me.  And  I  am  always  wanting  to put it  on  and  disappear, don't you know; or wondering if it is safe, and pulling it out to  make sure. I tried locking it up, but  I found I couldn't rest without it in  my pocket. I don't know why. And I don't seem able to make up my mind.'       'Then  trust mine,'  said Gandalf. 'It is quite  made  up.  Go away and  leave it behind. Stop possessing it. Give it to Frodo, and I will look after   him.'       Bilbo stood for a moment tense and undecided. Presently he sighed. 'All  right,' he said with an effort. I will.' Then he shrugged his shoulders, and  smiled rather ruefully. 'After  all that's what this party business  was all  about, really: to  give away lots of birthday presents,  and somehow make it   easier to give it away at the same time. It hasn't made it any easier in the  end, but it would be  a pity  to waste  all my  preparations. It would quite  spoil the joke.'       'Indeed  it would take  away the only point I ever saw in the  affair,'  said Gandalf.       'Very well,' said Bilbo, 'it goes to Frodo  with all the rest.' He drew  a  deep breath. 'And  now I  really must be starting, or somebody else  will  catch  me.  I  have  said good-bye, and I couldn't bear  to  do it  all over   again.' He picked up his bag and moved to the  door.       'You  have  still got the ring in your pocket,' said the wizard. 'Well,  so I have!' cried Bilbo. 'And my will and  all  the other documents too. You   had better take it and deliver it for me. That will be safest.'   ####-     'No,  don't give  the  ring  to  me,'  said  Gandalf. 'Put  it  on  the  mantelpiece. It will be safe enough  there, till Frodo comes.  I  shall wait  for him.'       Bilbo took out the envelope, but just as  he was about to set it by the  clock, his hand jerked back, and the  packet fell  on  the floor.  Before he  could pick it up, the wizard stooped and seized it and  set it in its place.  A spasm  of anger passed swiftly over  the hobbit's  face again. Suddenly it  gave way to a look of relief and a laugh. 'Well, that's that,' he said.  'Now  I'm off!'       They went out into the hall.  Bilbo chose  his favourite stick from the  stand; then he  whistled.  Three  dwarves came out of  different rooms where  they had been busy.       'Is everything ready?' asked Bilbo. 'Everything packed and la belled?'       'Everything,' they answered.       'Well, let's start then!' He stepped out of the front-door.       It was a fine night, and the black sky was dotted with stars. He looked  up,  sniffing  the air. 'What fun! What fun to be off again, off on the  Road  with dwarves!  This  is  what  I  have  really  been longing for, for years!  Good-bye!  ' he said, looking  at  his old  home and  bowing  to  the  door.  'Good-bye, Gandalf!'       'Good-bye, for the present,  Bilbo. Take  care of yourself! You are old  enough, and perhaps wise enough.'       'Take care! I  don't care. Don't  you worry about me! I am as happy now  as I have ever been, and that is saying a great deal. But the time has come.  I am being swept off my feet at last,' he added, and then in a low voice, as  if to himself, he sang softly in the dark:       The Road goes ever on and on        Down from the door where it began."
