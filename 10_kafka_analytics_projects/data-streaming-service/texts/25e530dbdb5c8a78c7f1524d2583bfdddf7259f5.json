  "text": " The friendship of Saruman and the  power  of Orthanc  cannot be lightly thrown aside, whatever grievances, real  or fancied, may lie behind. You have won  a battle  but  not a  war and that  with help on  which you cannot count again.  You may  find the Shadow of the  Wood at your  own door next:  it is wayward, and senseless, and  has no love  for Men.       'But  my  lord of  Rohan, am I to be called a murderer, because valiant  men have fallen in battle?  If  you go to war,  needlessly,  for  I did  not  desire  it, then men will be slain. But  if I am a murderer on that account,   ####-then all the House of Eorl is stained with murder; for they have fought many  wars, and assailed many who defied  them. Yet with some they have afterwards  made peace, none the worse for being politic. I say, Thjoden King:  shall we  have peace and friendship, you and I? It is ours to command '       'We will have peace,' said Thjoden  at last thickly and with an effort.  Several of the  Riders  cried out gladly. Thjoden held up his hand. 'Yes, we  will have peace,'  he said, now in a clear voice,  'we will have peace, when  you and all your works have perished -- and the works of your dark master to  whom you would deliver us. You are a liar. Saruman, and a corrupter of men's  hearts.  You hold out your hand to me,  and  I perceive only a finger of the  claw of  Mordor. Cruel  and cold! Even if your war on me was just as  it was  not, for were you ten times as wise you  would have no right  to rule me and  mine  for your own profit  as  you desired  --  even so, what will you say of  your torches in Westfold  and  the children  that lie dead  there?  And they  hewed Hbma's body before the gates of the Hornburg, after he  was dead.  When  you hang from  a  gibbet at  your  window for the sport of your own crows, I  will have peace with you and  Orthanc.  So  much  for  the House  of  Eorl. A  lesser son of great sires am I, but I do not need to lick your fingers. Turn  elsewhither. But I fear your voice has lost its charm.'       The Riders gazed up at Thjoden like men startled  out of a dream. Harsh  as an old raven's their master's  voice sounded in their ears after the music  of Saruman. But Saruman for a while was beside himself with wrath. He leaned  over the rail as if he would smite the King with his staff. To some suddenly  it seemed that they saw a snake coiling itself to strike.       'Gibbets  and crows!'  he  hissed,  and they shuddered  at  the hideous  change.  'Dotard!  What is  the house of  Eorl but  a  thatched  barn  where  brigands  drink  in the reek,  and  their brats roll on the floor among  the  dogs? Too long have they escaped the gibbet themselves. But the noose comes,   slow in the  drawing,  tight and hard in the end. Hang if you will!' Now his  voice changed, as he slowly mastered himself. 'I know not why I have had the  patience  to speak  to you.  For I need  you not, nor  your  little band  of  gallopers,  as swift to fly  as to  advance, Thjoden Horsemaster. Long ago I  offered you a state beyond your merit and your wit. I have offered it again,  so that those whom you mislead may clearly see the choice of roads. You give  me brag and abuse. So be it. Go back to your huts!        'But you, Gandalf!  For  you  at  least I am grieved,  feeling for your   ####-shame. How comes  it  that you  can  endure such company? For you are proud,  Gandalf-and not  without reason, having a noble mind and eyes that look both  deep and far. Even now will you not listen to my counsel?'       Gandalf stirred, and looked up. 'What have you to say that you did  not  say at our last meeting?' he asked. 'Or, perhaps, you have things to unsay?'       Saruman paused. 'Unsay?' he mused, as if puzzled. 'Unsay? I endeavoured  to advise you for your own good, but  you scarcely listened. You  are  proud  and  do not love advice,  having  indeed  a store of your own wisdom. But on  that occasion  you erred, I think, misconstruing my  intentions wilfully.  I  fear that in my eagerness to persuade you, I  lost  patience.  And  indeed I  regret it. For I bore you no ill-will; and even now  I bear none, though you   return to me in the company  of the violent and  the ignorant. How should I?   Are  we not both members of  a high  and  ancient order, most  excellent  in  Middle-earth? Our friendship would profit us both alike. Much we could still  accomplish together, to heal the disorders of the  world.  Let us understand  one another,  and  dismiss from thought these lesser folk! Let  them wait on  our decisions! For the common good I am  willing to redress the past, and to  receive you. Will you not consult with me? Will you not come up?'       So  great was the power that Saruman  exerted in this  last effort that  none that stood  within hearing were unmoved. But  now the  spell was wholly  different.  They  heard the  gentle remonstrance  of  a kindly  king with an  erring but much-loved minister. But they were shut out, listening at a  door  to  words  not  meant for  them: ill-mannered  children  or  stupid servants  overhearing the  elusive discourse  of their  elders, and wondering  how  it  would  affect their lot."
