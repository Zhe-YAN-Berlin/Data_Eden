Behind  them  the Mountain was  convulsed. Great rents opened in  its side. Slow rivers of  fire came down the  long slopes towards them. Soon they would be engulfed. A  rain of hot ash was falling.       They stood now; and Sam still holding his master's hand caressed it. He  sighed. 'What a  tale we have been in, Mr. Frodo, haven't  we?' he said.  'I   wish I could hear it told! Do you think they'll say:  Now comes the story of  Nine-fingered Frodo and the Ring of Doom? And then everyone  will hush, like  we  did,  when  in Rivendell they told us the tale of Beren One-hand and the  Great Jewel. I wish I could hear  it!  And I wonder how it will go on  after   our part.'       But even while he spoke  so, to keep fear away until the very last, his  eyes still strayed north,  north  into the eye of the wind, to where the sky  far off was  clear,  as the cold  blast, rising to  a  gale, drove  back the  darkness and the ruin of the clouds.          And so  it was that Gwaihir  saw them with his keen far-seeing eyes, as  down  the  wild  wind he came,  and  daring the great peril of the skies  he  circled in  the  air: two small dark figures,  forlorn, hand  in hand upon a   little  hill, while the  world  shook under them, and  gasped, and rivers of  fire drew near. And even as  he  espied them and came swooping down, he   saw  them  fall, worn out,  or  choked  with  fumes and heat, or stricken down by  despair at last, hiding the ir eyes from death.       Side by side they lay; and  down swept Gwaihir, and down came Landroval  and  Meneldor the swift; and in a dream, not  knowing what fate had befallen  them,  the wanderers were  lifted up and borne far away  out of the darkness  and the fire.       When Sam awoke, he found that he  was lying on some soft bed, but  over  him  gently swayed wide  beechen boughs,  and  through  their  young  leaves  sunlight glimmered, green and gold. All the  air was full of a sweet mingled   scent.       He  remembered that smell: the  fragrance  of Ithilien. 'Bless  me!' he  mused. 'How long have I been  asleep?' For the  scent had borne  him back to   ####-the day when he  had  lit  his little  fire under  the sunny bank; and for a   moment all else  between was out of  waking  memory. He stretched and drew  a  deep breath. 'Why, what a dream I've had!' he muttered. 'I am glad to wake!'  He sat  up and then he  saw  that  Frodo  was  lying  beside  him, and slept  peacefully,  one  hand  behind  his  head, and  the other  resting  upon the  coverlet. It was the right hand, and the third finger was missing.       Full memory flooded back, and Sam cried aloud: 'It wasn't a dream! Then  where are we?'       And a  voice spoke softly behind:  'In the land of Ithilien, and in the  keeping of the King; and he awaits you.' With that Gandalf stood before him,  robed in white, his beard now  gleaming like  pure snow in  the twinkling of  the leafy sunlight. 'Well, Master Samwise, how do you feel?' he said.       But Sam lay back, and stared with open mouth, and for a moment, between  bewilderment  and great  joy,  he  could  not  answer.  At  last  he gasped:  'Gandalf! I thought you were dead! But then I thought I was  dead myself. Is  everything sad going to come untrue? What's happened to the world?'       'A great Shadow  has departed,' said  Gandalf, and then he  laughed and  the  sound was like music,  or  like  water in  a  parched land; and  as  he  listened  the thought came to  Sam  that he had not heard laughter, the pure  sound of merriment, for days upon days without count.  It fell upon his ears  like  the echo of all the joys he had ever  known. But he himself burst into  tears. Then, as a  sweet rain will pass down a wind of  spring  and the  sun  will shine out the  clearer, his  tears  ceased, and his laughter welled up,  and laughing he sprang from his bed.       'How do I feel?' he cried. 'Well, I don't know how to say it. I feel, I  feel' - he waved his arms in the air  - 'I feel like spring after winter, and  sun on the leaves; and like trumpets and harps and all the songs I have ever   heard!' He stopped and he turned towards his  master. 'But how's Mr. Frodo?'  he said. 'Isn't it a shame about  his poor hand? But  I hope he's all  right  otherwise. He's had a cruel time.'       'Yes, I am all right otherwise,' said Frodo, sitting up and laughing in  his turn. I fell asleep again waiting  for  you, Sam,  you sleepyhead. I was  awake early this morning, and now it must be nearly noon.'       'Noon?' said Sam, trying to calculate. 'Noon of what day? '       'The fourteenth  of the New Year,' said Gandalf; 'or  if you like,  the  eighth day of April in the Shire reckoning.( But in Gondor the New Year will   ####-always now begin upon  the twenty -fifth  of March when Sauron fell, and when  you were brought out of the fire to the King."
