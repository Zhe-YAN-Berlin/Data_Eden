Soon  it bent again  and. with a  last  eastward  course passed in a cutting along the face of the  cone  and came to the dark  door in the Mountain's side, the door  of the  Samma th  Naur. Far  away  now  rising  towards  the  South the  sun, piercing  the  smokes and haze, burned  ominous, a dull  bleared  disc of red; but all Mordor lay about the Mountain   like a dead land, silent, shadow-folded, waiting for some dreadful stroke.       Sam came to the gaping mouth and peered in. It was dark and  hot, and a   deep rumbling shook the  air.  'Frodo!  Master!'  he  called. There  was  no  answer. For a  moment he stood, his heart beating with wild fears,  and then   he plunged in. A shadow followed him.       At first he could see nothing. In his great need he drew  out once more  the phial of Galadriel, but it  was pale and cold in  his trembling hand and  threw no light  into that stifling  dark. He was come  to the  heart of  the  realm  of  Sauron  and  the  forges  of  his   ancient  might,  greatest  in  Middle-earth;  all other powers  were here  subdued. Fearfully he took a few  uncertain steps in the dark, and then all at once there came a  flash of red  that leaped upward, and smote the high black roof. Then Sam saw  that he was  in a long cave or tunnel that bored into the  Mountain's  smoking cone.  But  only a short way ahead its floor and the walls on either side were cloven by  a great fissure, out of which the  red glare came, now leaping u p, now dying  down  into  darkness; and all the while  far  below there was a rumour and a   trouble as of great engines throbbing and labouring.       The light sprang up  again, and there on the brink of the chasm, at the  very Crack of Doom, stood Frodo,  black against the glare, tense, erect, but   ####-still as if he had been turned to stone.       'Master!' cried Sam.       Then Frodo stirred  and  spoke with a  clear voice, indeed with a voice  clearer and more powerful than Sam had ever heard him use, and it rose above  the throb and turmoil of Mount Doom, ringing in the roof and walls.        'I have come,' he said. 'But I  do not choose now to do what I  came to  do. I will not do this  deed. The Ring is mine!' And suddenly, as he set  it  on  his finger,  he  vanished  from Sam's sight.  Sam gasped,  but he had no  chance to cry out, for at that moment many things happened.       Something struck Sam violently in the back,  his legs were knocked from  under him and he was flung aside, striking his head against the stony  floor,  as a dark shape sprang  over him. He  lay still  and for a  moment  all went  black.       And far away, as Frodo put on the Ring and claimed it for his own, even  in  Sammath Naur the  very heart  of his realm, the Power  in  Barad-dyr was  shaken, and  the Tower trembled from its foundations to its  proud and bitter   crown.  The  Dark Lord was suddenly  aware of him, and  his Eye piercing all  shadows  looked  across the plain to  the door  that he had  made;  and  the  magnitude of  his own folly was revealed to him in a blinding flash, and all  the devices of his enemies were at last laid bare.  Then his wrath blazed in  consuming flame, but his fear rose like a vast black smoke to choke him. For  he knew his deadly peril and the thread upon which his doom now hung.       From all his policies and  webs of  fear  and treachery, from  all  his  stratagems and wars his mind shook  free; and throughout his realm  a tremor  ran, his slaves quailed, and his armies  halted,  and his captains  suddenly  steerless,  bereft of will, wavered and  despaired. For they were forgotten.  The whole mind and purpose of the Power that wielded them was now bent   with  overwhelming  force  upon  the Mountain.  At his  summons,  wheeling with  a   rending cry, in a last desperate race there flew, faster than the winds, the  Nazgyl the Ringwraiths, and with a storm of wings they hurtled southwards to  Mount Doom.       Sam got up. He was dazed,  and blood streaming from his head dripped in  his eyes. He groped  forward, and then  he saw a strange and terrible thing.  Gollum on the edge of the abyss was fighting like a mad thing with an unseen  foe. To and fro he swayed, now  so near the brink that almost he tumbled in,  now dragging back, falling to the ground, rising, and falling again. And all   ####-the while he hissed but spoke no words.       The fires below  awoke in  anger,  the  red  light  blazed, and all the  cavern was  filled with  a great glare  and heat. Suddenly  Sam saw Gollum's  long hands  draw  upwards  to  his mouth; his white fangs gleamed,  and then  snapped as  they bit. Frodo  gave a cry, and there he was, fallen  upon  his  knees at the chasm's edge. But Gollum, dancing  like a mad thing, held aloft   the ring, a finger still thrust within its circle. It shone now as if verily  it was wrought of living fire.       'Precious,  precious,  precious!'  Gollum  cried. 'My  Precious!  O  my  Precious!'  And with that, even as his eyes were lifted  up to gloat  on his  prize, he  stepped  too far, toppled, wavered for a moment on the brink, and  then  with a shriek he fell."
