Even now, burdened as he was, he was widening the  track for those who followed, thrusting the snow aside as he went.       They  came  at length  to  the  great drift.  It  was  flung across the  mountain-path like a  sheer  and sudden  wall, and  its  crest, sharp as  if  shaped with  knives,  reared up more than twice the  height of  Boromir; but  through the middle  a passage had been  beaten, rising  and falling  like  a   bridge.  On  the  far  side Merry  and Pippin were set down, and there  they  waited with Legolas for the rest of the Company to arrive.       After a  while Boromir returned carrying Sam. Behind in  the narrow but  now well-trodden track came Gandalf,  leading  Bill with Gimli perched among  the baggage. Last came Aragorn carrying Frodo. They passed through the lane;  but hardly had Frodo touched the ground when with a deep rumble there rolled  down a fall of stones and slithering  snow. The spray of it half blinded the  Company as they crouched against the cliff,  and  when the air cleared again  they saw that the path was blocked behind them.       `Enough, enough!' cried Gimli.  'We are departing as quickly as we may!'  And  indeed with that  last stroke the malice  of  the mountain seemed to be  expended, as if Caradhras was  satisfied  that the invaders had been  beaten  off  and  would not  dare to  return. The threat of snow lift ed; the  clouds  began to break and the light grew broader.       As Legolas had reported, they found that the snow  became steadily more  shallow as they went down, so that even the hobbits could trudge along. Soon  they  all stood once more on the  flat shelf at the head of the steep  slope  where they had felt the first flakes of snow the night before.       The morning was now far advanced. From  the high place they looked back    ####-westwards over the lower lands.  Far away in the tumble of country  that lay  at the foot of the  mountain  was  the  dell  from which they had started to  climb the pass.        Frodo's legs ached. He was chilled to the bone and hungry; and his head  was dizzy as he thought of the long and painful march downhill. Black specks  swam  before his eyes. He rubbed them, but the black specks remained. In the  distance below him, but still high above the lower foothills, dark dots were  circling in the air.       `The birds again!' said Aragorn, pointing down.       'That cannot be helped  now,' said Gandalf.  `Whether they are good  or   evil,  or have nothing to do with us at  all, we must go  down at  once. Not  even on the knees of Caradhras will we wait for another night-fall!'       A cold  wind flowed down behind them, as they turned their backs on the  Redhorn Gate,  and stumbled  wearily down the  slope. Caradhras had defeated  them.   ####-     Chapter 4. A Journey in the Dark            It was  evening, and the  grey light  was again  waning fast, when they  halted  for the night. They were very  weary.  The mountains were veiled  in  deepening dusk, and the wind was cold. Gandalf spared them one more  mouthful  each of the miruvor  of Rivendell. When they had eaten some food he called a   council.        'We cannot, of  course, go on again  tonight,' he said. `The attack   on  the Redhorn Gate has tired us out, and we must rest here for a while.'       `And then where are we to go? ' asked Frodo.       'We still have our journey and our errand before us,' answered Gandalf.   `We have no choice but to go on, or to return to Rivendell.'       Pippin's  face brightened visibly at the  mere  mention  of  return  to  Rivendell; Merry and Sam looked  up hopefully. But Aragorn  and Boromir  made  no sign. Frodo looked troubled.        `I wish I was back there,' he said. `But how can I return without shame  -- unless there is indeed no other way, and we are already defeated? '       `You  are right, Frodo,'  said Gandalf:  `to go back is to admit defeat  and face worse defeat to come. If we go  back now, then the Ring must remain  there: we shall not be able to set out again. Then sooner or later Rivendell  will be  besieged,  and after a  brief and bitter time it will be destroyed.  The  Ringwraiths  are deadly  enemies, but they are only shadows  yet of the  power and terror they would possess if the Ruling Ring was on their master's  hand again.'       'Then  we must  go on, if there is a way,' said  Frodo with a sigh. Sam  sank back into gloom.       `There is a way that we may attempt,' said Gandalf. `I thought from the  beginning, when  first I considered this journey, that we should try it. But  it is not a pleasant way, and I have not spoken of it to the Company before.  Aragorn was against it, until the pass over the mountains had  at least been  tried.'       `If  it  is a worse road  than the  Redhorn Gate,  then it must be evil   ####-indeed,' said Merry."
