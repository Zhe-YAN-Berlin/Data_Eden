Here the highlands of the  Emyn  Muil ran from North to South in two long tumbled ridges. The western side of  each ridge was steep  and difficult, but  the  eastward slopes were gentler,  furrowed  with  many  gullies  and  narrow  ravines.  All  night  the  three  companions scrambled in  this bony land, climbing to the  crest of the first   and tallest ridge, and down again into the darkness of a deep winding valley  on the other side.       There in the still cool hour before dawn they rested for a brief space.  The moon had long gone down before them, the stars glittered above them; the  first light  of day had not  yet come over the dark  hills behind.  For  the  moment Aragorn was at a loss:  the  orc-trail had descended into the valley,  but there it had vanished.       'Which way would they turn, do you  think?' said Legolas. 'Northward to  take a straighter road to Isengard,  or Fangorn, if that is their aim as you   guess? Or southward to strike the Entwash?'       'They will not make  for  the  river,  whatever mark they aim at'' said  Aragorn. 'And unless there is much amiss  in Rohan and  the power of Saruman  is greatly increased;  they will take  the  shortest way that they  can find  over the fields of the Rohirrim. Let us search northwards!'       The  dale  ran like  a stony  trough between  the  ridged  hills, and a   trickling stream flowed among the boulders  at the  bottom. A cliff  frowned  upon their right; to their left rose  grey  slopes, dim  and shadowy in  the  late night.  They  went  on  for  a  mile  or  more northwards. Aragorn  was  searching. bent towards  the ground,  among the folds and gullies leading up  into  the western ridge. Legolas was some way ahead. Suddenly the Elf gave a   cry and the others came running towards him.       'We have already overtaken some of those that we are hunting,' he said.  'Look!' He pointed, and they saw that  what they had  at  first  taken to be  boulders lying at the foot of the slope were huddled  bodies. Five dead Orcs   ####-lay there. They had  been hewn  with many  cruel strokes, and  two had  been  beheaded. The ground was wet with their dark blood.       'Here is another riddle!' said Gimli.  'But it needs the light  of  day  and for that we cannot wait.'       'Yet however you  read it,  it  seems  not  unhopeful,'  said  Legolas.   'Enemies  of the  Orcs  are  likely to  be our friends. Do any folk dwell in  these hills?'       'No,' said Aragorn. 'The Rohirrim seldom come  here, and it is far from  Minas Tirith. It might be that some  company of  Men  were  hunting here for  reasons that we do not know. Yet I think not.'       'What do you think?' said Gimli.       'I think that  the  enemy  brought his  own enemy  with  him,' answered  Aragorn. 'These are Northern Orcs from far away. Among the slain are none of  the great  Orcs with the strange badges. There was a quarrel, I guess: it is  no uncommon thing with these foul  folk. Maybe there was some  dispute about  the road.'       'Or about the  captives,' said  Gimli. 'Let us hope that they, too, did  not meet their end here.'       Aragorn  searched the ground in a wide  circle,  but no other traces of  the fight could be found. They went on. Already the eastward sky was turning  pale; the  stars were fading, and a grey light was  slowly growing. A little  further  north they  came  to  a fold  in which a tiny stream,  falling  and  winding, had cut a stony path down into  the valley. In it some bushes grew,   and there were patches of grass upon its sides.       'At last!'  said Aragorn.  'Here are  the tracks that  we seek! Up this  water -channel: this is the way that the Orcs went after their debate.'       Swiftly now the pursuers turned and followed the new path.  As if fresh  from a  night's rest they sprang  from stone to stone. At last  they reached  the  crest of  the  grey hill,  and a  sudden breeze blew in  their hair and  stirred their cloaks: the chill wind of dawn.       Turning  back they saw across  the  River  the  far hills kindled.  Day  leaped into the sky. The red rim of the  sun rose over  the shoulders of the  dark  land. Before them in the West the world lay still, formless  and grey;  but even  as they looked,  the shadows of night melted, the  colours  of the  waking earth returned: green flowed over the wide meads  of Rohan; the white  mists shimmered in  the watervales;  and far off to the left, thirty leagues  or more, blue  and purple stood the  White Mountains,  rising  into peaks of   ####-jet, tipped with glimmering snows, flushed with the rose of morning.       'Gondor! Gondor!' cried  Aragorn. 'Would that I looked on  you again in  happier hour! Not yet does my road lie southward to your bright streams.        Gondor! Gondor, between the Mountains and the Sea!       West Wind blew there; the light upon the Silver Tree       Fell like bright rain in gardens of the Kings of old."
