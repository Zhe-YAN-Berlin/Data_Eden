  "text": "'       'I dare say!' said Pippin. 'That  is, if the  track goes on so far, and  does not simply lead us into a bog and leave us there.  Who made  the track,  do you suppose, and why?  I am sure it was not for our benefit. I am getting   very suspicious  of this Forest and everything in it, and I begin to believe  all  the stories about it. And have you any idea how far eastward we  should   have to go?'       'No,' said Merry, 'I  haven't. I don't  know in the  least how far down  the Withywindle we are, or who could possibly come here often enough to  make  a path along it. But there is no other way out that I can see or think of.'       There being nothing  else for it, they filed out, and Merry led them to  the path that he had discovered. Everywhere the reeds and  grasses were lush  and tall, in places far above their heads; but once found, the path was easy  to  follow, as it  turned  and twisted, picking out the sounder ground among  the bogs and pools. Here and there it passed  over other rills, running down  gullies into the Wi thywindle  out of the higher  forest -lands,  and at these  points there were tree-trunks or bundles of brushwood laid carefully across.        The  hobbits began to feel very hot. There were armies of flies  of all  kinds buzzing round their  ears, and the afternoon sun was burning  on their  backs.  At last they  came suddenly into a thin shade;  great grey  branches  reached across  the  path. Each step forward became more  reluctant than the  last. Sleepiness seemed to be creeping out of the ground and up their  legs,  and falling softly out of the air upon their heads and eyes.       Frodo  felt his  chin go down and  his head nod. Just in front  of  him  Pippin fell forward on to his knees.  Frodo halted. 'It's no good,' he heard  Merry saying. 'Can't go another step  without rest. Must have nap. It's cool  under the willows. Less flies!'   ####-     Frodo did not like the sound of this. 'Come  on!' he  cried. 'We  can't   have a  nap yet. We must get clear of the Forest first.' But the others were  too far gone to care. Besi de them Sam stood yawning and blinking stupidly.        Suddenly  Frodo  himself  felt  sleep overwhelming him.  His head swam.  There now seemed  hardly a sound  in the air. The flies had stopped buzzing.  Only a gentle noise on the edge of hearing,  a soft  fluttering as of a song  half whispered, seemed to stir in the boughs above. He lifted his heavy eyes  and  saw leaning over him a  huge willow-tree,  old  and hoary. Enormous  it   looked,  its  sprawling  branches  going  up like  reaching  arms with  many  long-fingered hands,  its knotted and twisted trunk gaping  in wide fissures  that creaked faintly as the boughs  moved. The leaves fluttering against the  bright sky dazzled  him,  and he toppled over, lying where  he fell upon the  grass.       Merry and Pippin dragged themselves  forward  and  lay down  with their   backs to  the willow-trunk.  Behind them  the  great  cracks gaped  wide  to  receive them as the  tree swayed and creaked. They looked up at the grey and  yellow leaves, moving softly against the light, and singing. They shut their  eyes, and  then it seemed  that  they  could almost hear words,  cool words,   saying something about water and sleep. They gave themselves up to the spell  and fell fast asleep at the foot of the great grey willow.       Frodo   lay for  a while  fighting with  the sleep that was overpowering  him;  then  with  an  effort  he  struggled  to  his feel again. He  felt  a   compelling  desire for cool water.  'Wait for me,  Sam,' he  stammered.  'Must   bathe feet a minute.'       Half in a dream he wandered forward to the riverward  side of the tree,  where great winding roots grew out into the stream, like  gnarled  dragonets  straining down to drink. He straddled one of these, and paddled his hot feel  in the cool brown water; and there he too suddenly fell asleep with his back   against the tree.       Sam sat down and  scratched his head, and yawned like a  cavern. He was  worried.  The  afternoon  was  getting late,  and  he  thought  this  sudden  sleepiness  uncanny.  'There's more  behind this than sun and warm air,'  he  muttered  to himself.  'I don't like this great big tree. I  don't trust it.  Hark at it singing about sleep now! This won't do at all!'       He pulled himself to his feet, and staggered off to see what had become  of the ponies. He found that  two had wandered on a good way along the path;  and he had just  caught them and brought them back towards the others,  when   ####-he  heard two noises; one loud, and the other  soft but very  clear. One was  the  splash of something heavy falling into the water; the other was a noise  like the snick of a lock when a door quietly closes fast.       He rushed back to the bank. Frodo was  in the water close to the  edge,  and a great tree-root seemed to be over him and holding him down, but he was  not struggling. Sam gripped him by the  jacket, and dragged him  from  under  the root; and then with difficulty hauled him on to the bank."
