'You come none too soon,  my friend.  Much loss and sorrow has befallen us.'       'Then let us avenge it, ere  we speak  of it!'  said Aragorn,  and they  rode back to battle together.       Hard  fighting and long  labour they had  still; for the Southrons were  bold  men and grim, and fierce in despair; and  the Easterlings  were strong  and war-hardened and asked for no quarter. And so in this place and that, by  burned  homestead or  barn,  upon hillock or mound, under wa ll or on  field,   still they gathered and rallied and fought until the day wore away.       Then the Sun went at last behind Mindolluin and filled all the sky with  a great  burning, so  that  the hills and the mountains were  dyed  as  with  blood; fire  glowed in  the  River, and the grass of the Pelennor lay red in  the nightfall. And in that hour the great Battle of  the field of Gondor was  over; and not one living foe was left within  the circuit of the Rammas. All  were slain  save those who fled  to die, or to drown  in the red foam of the  River. Few ever came  eastward to Morgul or Mordor; and  to the land of  the  Haradrim came only a tale from far off: a rumour of  the wrath and terror of  Gondor.       Aragorn and  Jomer and Imrahil rode back towards  the Gate of the City,   and they  were now weary beyond joy  or sorrow. These three were  unscathed,  for such was their  fortune and the skill  and might of their  arms, and few  indeed had dared  to abide them or  look on their faces in the hour of their  wrath. But many others were hurt or  maimed or dead upon the field. The axes  hewed Forlong  as he fought  alone and unhorsed; and both Duilin of Morthond  and his  brother  were  trampled  to death  when they assailed the  mymakil,  leading  their  bowmen  close  to shoot at the eyes of the monsters. Neither  Hirluin the  fair would return to Pinnath Gelin, nor Grimbold  to Grimslade,   nor Halbarad  to  the Northlands,  dour -handed  Ranger.  No few  had fallen,   ####-renowned or nameless, captain or  soldier; for it was a great battle and the  full count of it  no tale has told. So long afterward a maker in Rohan  said  in his song of the Mounds of Mundburg:       We heard of the horns in the hills ringing,       the swords shining in the South -kingdom.       Steeds went striding to the Stoningland       as wind in the morning. War was kindled.       There Thjoden fell, Thengling mighty,       to his golden halls and green pastures       in the Northern fields never returning,       high lord of the host. Harding and Guthlbf       DÂ®nhere and Djorwine, doughty Grimbold,       Herefara and Herubrand, Horn and Fastred,       fought and fell there in a far country:       in the Mounds of Mundburg under mould they lie        with their league-fellows, lords of Gondor.       Neither Hirluin the Fair to the hills by the sea,       nor Forlong the old to the flowering vales       ever, to Arnach, to his own country       returned in triumph; nor the tall bowmen,       Derufin and Duilin, to their dark waters,       meres of Morthond under mountain -shadows.       Death in the morning and at day's ending        lords took and lowly. Long now they sleep       under grass in Gondor by the Great River.       Grey now as tears, gleaming silver,       red then it rolled, roaring water:       foam dyed with blood flamed a t sunset;       as beacons mountains burned at evening;       red fell the dew in Rammas Echor.     ####-   Chapter 7. The Pyre of Denethor            When the dark shadow at the Gate withdrew Gandalf still sat motionless.   But Pippin rose to his  feet, as if a great weight had been lifted from him;  and  he stood listening to  the horns, and it seemed to  him that they would  break his  heart  with joy. And  never in after years could  he  hear a horn  blown in the distance  without tears starting in  his eyes. But now suddenly  his errand  returned  to  his memory,  and  he  ran forward.  At that moment  Gandalf stirred and spoke to Shadowfax, and was  about to  ride through  the  Gate.       'Gandalf, Gandalf! ' cried Pippin, and Shadowfax halted.       'What are you  doing here?'  said Gandalf. 'Is it not a law in the City  that  those who  wear the black and  silver must stay in the Citadel, unless  their lord gives them leave?'       'He has,' said Pippin. 'He sent me away. But I am frightened. Something  terrible may happen up  there. The  Lord is  out of his  mind, I think. I am  afraid he will kill himself, and kill Faramir too. Can't you do something?'       Gandalf looked through the  gaping  Gate, and already  on the fields he  heard the gathering sound of  battle. He clenched his  hand. 'I must go ' he  said. 'The Black Rider is abroad, and he will yet  bring ruin on  us. I have  no time.'       'But Faramir!' cried Pippin.  'He is  not dead, and they will  burn him  alive, if someone does not stop them."
