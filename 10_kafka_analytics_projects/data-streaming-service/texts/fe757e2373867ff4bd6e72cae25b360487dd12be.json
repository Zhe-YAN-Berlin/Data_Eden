The horn upon the left was tall  and slender; and in it burned a red light, or else the red light in the land  beyond was shining through a hole. He saw now: it  was a black  tower poised  above the outer pass. He touched Sam's arm and pointed.       'I  don't like the look of that! ' said Sam.  `So  this secret  way  of  yours is guarded after all,' he growled, turning to Gollum. 'As you knew all  along, I suppose? '       'All ways  are watched, yes,' said Gollum.  `Of  course they  are.  But  hobbits must  try  some way. This may  be least watched. Perhaps they've all   gone away to big battle, perhaps! '       'Perhaps,' grunted Sam.  'Well, it  still  seems a long  way off, and a   long way  up before we get there. And there's still the tunnel. I think  you   ought to rest now,  Mr. Frodo. I don't know what time of day or night it is,  but we've kept going for hours and hours.'       `Yes, we must  rest,' said Frodo. 'Let us find some corner out  of  the  wind, and gather our  strength-for  the last lap.' For so  he felt it to be.  The  terrors of  the land  beyond, and  the deed to  be  done there,  seemed  remote, too  far off yet to  trouble  him. All his mind  was bent on getting  through or over this impenetrable wall and guard.  If once he could do  that  impossible thing, then  somehow the errand would be  accomplished, or so  it  seemed to him in that  dark hour of weariness, still  labouring in the stony  shadows under Cirith Ungol.       In a dark crevice between two great piers of rock they sat down:  Frodo  and  Sam a  little  way within. and Gollum crouched upon the ground near the  opening. There the hobbits took what  they expected would be their last meal  before they went down into the Nameless Land, maybe the last meal they  would  ever  eat together. Some of the food  of Gondor they ate, and  wafers of the  waybread of the Elves. and they drank a little. But of their water they were  sparing and took only enough to moisten their dry mouths.       `I wonder when we'll find water again? ' said Sam. 'But I suppose  even  over there they drink? Orcs drink, don't they? '       'Yes,  they drink,' said Frodo. 'But do not let  us speak of that. Such  drink is not for us.'       `Then  all  the  more need  to fill our bottles,' said  Sam. `But there  isn't any water up here: not  a sound or a trickle  have I heard. And anyway   ####-Faramir said we were not to drink any water in Morgul.'       'No water flowing out of Imlad Morgul, were his words,' said Frodo. `We  are not in that valley now, and if we came  on a spring  it would be flowing  into it and not out of it.'       'I  wouldn't  trust  it,' said Sam, 'not  till  I was dying  of thirst.  There's a  wicked feeling  about this  place.' He  sniffed. 'And  a smell, I  fancy. Do you notice it? A queer kind of a smell, stuffy. I don't like it.'       'I don't like anything here at all.' said Frodo, `step or stone, breath  or bone. Earth, air and water all seem accursed. But so our path is laid.'       'Yes, that's so,'  said Sam. `And we shouldn't be here at all,  if we'd  known more about it before we started. But I  suppose  it's often  that way.  The brave things  in the old  tales and songs,  Mr. Frodo: adventures,  as I  used to call them. I used to think that they were things  the wonderful folk   of the stories  went out and looked  for,  because they wanted them, because  they were exciting and  life was a bit dull, a kind of a sport, as you might  say. But that's not the  way of it with the tales  that  really mattered, or   the  ones that stay in the mind. Folk seem to have been just landed in them,  usually -- their paths were laid that way, as you put it. But  I expect they  had lots of chances, like us, of turning back, only they didn't. And if they  had, we  shouldn't know, because they'd have  been  forgotten. We hear about  those as just went on  -- and not all to a  good end, mind you; at least not  to what  folk  inside a story and not outside it call a good  end. You know,   coming home, and finding things all right, though not quite the same  -- like  old Mr Bilbo.  But those aren't always  the best tales to  hear, though they  may be the  best tales to get landed in! I wonder what sort of a tale  we've  fallen into?  '       `I wonder,' said Frodo. 'But I don't know. And that's the way of a real  tale. Take any one that you're fond of. You may know, or guess, what kind of  a  tale it is, happy -ending or sad-ending, but the people  in it don't know.   And you don't want them to.'       'No, sir, of course not. Beren now,  he  never thought he was  going to  get that Silmaril from the  Iron Crown in Thangorodrim, and yet he did,  and  that was a worse place and a blacker danger than ours.  But  that's  a  long  tale, of course, and goes on past the happiness and into grief and beyond it  -- and the  Silmaril  went  on and  came to Edrendil. And why, sir, I  never   thought of that before! We've got  -- you've got some  of  the light of it in  that star-glass  that the Lady gave you! Why,   to  think of it, we're in the   ####-same tale still! It's going on."
