For a moment the sight of  it  gladdened the hearts of the hobbits; but  Gollum cowered down, muttering curses on the White Face. Then Frodo and   Sam  staring at  the sky, breathing deeply of the  fresher  air, saw  it come:  a   small  cloud  flying from the  accursed hills; a  black  shadow loosed  from  Mordor;  a vast shape winged and ominous. It  scudded  across the  moon, and  with a deadly cry went away westward, outrunning the wind in its fell speed.       They fell  forward, grovelling  heedlessly on the cold earth.  But  the  shadow of horror wheeled and returned, passing  lower now, right above them,  sweeping the  fen-reek with its ghastly wings. And then  it was gone, flying  back to Mordor with the speed of the wrath of Sauron; and behind it the wind  roared away, leaving the  Dead Marshes bare and bleak. The naked  waste,  as  far  as the eye could pierce, even to the  distant  menace of the mountains,   was dappled with the fitful moonlight.       Frodo and Sam got up, rubbing their eyes, like children wakened from an  evil dream to find the familiar  night still over the world. But Gollum  lay  on the ground as if  he had been stunned. They  roused him  with difficulty,  and for some time  he  would not  lift  his  face, but knelt forward on  his  elbows, covering the back of his head with his large flat hands.        `Wraiths!'  he wailed. `Wraiths on wings! The Precious is their master.   ####-They see everything, everything. Nothing can hide from them. Curse the White  Face! And they tell  H im everything. He sees, He knows. Ach, gollum, gollum,  gollum!  '  It was not until  the moon had  sunk, westering  far  beyond Tol  Brandir, that he would get up or make a move.       From that time on Sam thought that he  sensed a change in Gollum again.   He was more  fawning and would-be  friendly; but Sam  surprised some strange  looks  in his eyes at times, especially towards Frodo; and he went back more  and  more  into his  old  manner  of  speaking. And Sam  had another growing  anxiety. Frodo seemed to be weary, weary to the point of exhaustion. He said  nothing.  indeed he  hardly  spoke  at all; and  he did not complain, but he  walked like one who carries a load, the  weight of which is ever increasing;  and he dragged along, slower and slower, so that Sam had often to beg Gollum  to wait and not to leave their master behind.       In fact with every step towards the gates of Mordor Frodo felt the Ring  on  its chain about his neck grow  more burdensome.  He was now beginning to  feel  it as an actual  weight  dragging him earthwards.  But far more he was  troubled by the Eye: so he called it to  himself. It was that more  than the  drag of the Ring that made him cower  and stoop as he walked. The Eye:  that  horrible  growing sense of a  hostile will  that  strove with great power to  pierce all shadows of  cloud, and earth, and  flesh, and to see you: to  pin  you under its deadly gaze, naked, immovable. So thin, so frail and thin, the  veils  were become  that still warded  it  off. Frodo  knew just  where  the  present habitation and heart of that will now was: as certainly as a man can  tell the  direction of the sun with his eyes shut. He was facing it, and its  potency beat upon his brow.        Gollum probably felt something of the same sort.  But  what went  on in  his wretched heart between the pressure of the Eye, and the lust of the Ring  that was so near, and his grovelling  promise made half in the fear of  cold  iron, the hobbits did not guess: Frodo gave no thought to it. Sam's mind was  occupied  mostly  with his  master hardly  noticing the  dark cloud that had  fallen on his own  heart. He put Frodo  in front  of  him  now, and  kept  a   watchful eye on every movement of  his,  supporting him if  he stumbled, and  trying to encourage him with clumsy words.        When day came at last the hobbits were surprised to see how much closer  the ominous mountains had already drawn. The air was now clearer and colder,  and though still far off, the walls of Mordor were no longer a cloudy menace  on the edge of sight, but as  gr im black towers they frowned across a dismal   ####-waste. The marshes were at an end, dying away into dead peats and wide flats  of  dry cracked mud. The land ahead rose in long shallow  slopes, barren and  pitiless, towards the desert that lay at Sauron's gate.       While the  grey light lasted,  they cowered under a  black  stone  like  worms,  shrinking, lest the winged terror should pass  and spy them with its  cruel eyes. The  remainder of that journey  was a shadow of growing  fear in   which  memory could  find   nothing  to  rest upon.  For two more nights they  struggled on through the weary pathless land. The air, as it seemed to them,  grew harsh, and filled  with  a  bitter  reek that caught their  breath  and  parched their mouths."
