At the last  before the guests set oat Jomer and  Jowyn came to  Merry,  and  they said: 'Farewell now, Meriadoc of the  Shire  and Holdwine  of  the  Mark! Ride to good fortune, and ride back soon to our welcome!'       And Jomer said: 'Kings of  old would  have laden you  with gifts that a   wain could not bear for your deeds upon the fields of Mundburg; and yet  you  will take  naught,  you say, but the  arms that  were given to you.  This  I  suffer, for indeed I have no gift that is  worthy; but my sister begs you to  receive this small thing, as a memorial of Dernhelm and of the horns  of the   Mark at the coming of the morning.'       Then  Jowyn gave to Merry  an ancient horn, small but cunningly wrought  all of fair silver with a baldric of green; and wrights had engraven upon it  swift horsemen riding in  a  line  that  wound about it from the tip  to the  mouth; and there were set runes of great virtue.       'This is  an  heirloom of  our house,' said Jowyn. 'It was made  by the  Dwarves, and came from the hoard of Scatha the  Worm. Eorl the Young  brought  it from the North. He that blows it  at need shall set fear in the hearts of  his enemies and joy in the hearts of  his friends, and they  shall hear  him   ####-and come to him.'       Then Merry  took  the  horn, for it could not be refused, and he kissed  Jowyn's hand; and they embraced him, and so they parted for that time.       Now the guests were  ready,  and  they drank the stirrup-cup, and  with  great praise  and friendship they departed, and  came at  length  to  Helm's   Deep, and there they rested two  days. Then Legolas  repaid  his  promise to  Gimli and went with him to the  Glittering Caves;  and when they returned he  was silent, and  would  say only that Gimli  alone could find fit  words  to  speak of them. 'And never  before has  a Dwarf claimed a victory over an Elf  in a contest of words,' said he. 'Now therefore let us go to Fangorn and set  the score right!'       From  Deeping-coomb  they rode to Isengard,  and saw  how the Ents  had  busied  themselves. All the stone-circle had been  thrown down and  removed,  and  the land within was made into a garden  filled with orchards and trees,   and a stream  ran through  it;  but in  the midst of all there was a lake of  clear  water, and out of it  the  Tower  of  Orthanc  rose  still, tall  and  impregnable, and its black rock was mirrored in the pool.       For a while the travellers sat where once the old gates of Isengard had  stood, and there were now two tall trees like sentinels  a t the beginning of  a green-bordered path that ran towards Orthanc; and they looked in wonder at  the work that had been done, but no living thing could they see far or near.  But presently they heard a voice calling hoom-hom, hoom-hom;  and there  came  Treebeard striding down the path to greet them with Quickbeam at his side.       'Welcome to the  Treegarth of Orthanc!' he said. 'I  knew that you were  coming, but I was at work up the valley; there is much still to be done. But  you  have  not been idle  either away in the south and the east, I hear; and  all that I hear is good, very good.' Then Treebeard praised all their deeds,   of which he seemed to have full knowledge; and at last he stopped and looked  long at Gandalf.       'Well, come  now!' he said.  'You  have proved mightiest,  and all your  labours have gone well.  Where now would you be  going? And why  do you  come  here?'       'To see how your work goes, my friend,' said Gandalf, 'and to thank you   for your aid in all that has been achieved.'       'Hoom, well, that is fair enough,' said Treebeard; 'for to be sure Ents   ####-have played  their  part. And  not  only in  dealing with that,  hoom,  that  accursed tree-slayer that dwelt here. For there was a great inrush of those,  burbrum,   those  evileyed  -  blackhanded  -  bowlegged  -  flinthearted  -  clawfingered  - foulbellied  -  bloodthirsty,  morimaite -  sincahonda,  hoom,  well, since  you are  hasty folk and their full name is as long as  years of  torment, those vermin  of orcs; and they came  over  the River a nd down from  the  North and all round the wood of  Laurelindurenan, which they could  not  get into, thanks  to the Great ones who  are here.' He bowed to the Lord and  Lady of Lurien.       'And these same foul creatures were more than  surprised to meet us  out  on the Wold, for they had  not heard of us before; though that might be said  also of better folk. And not many  will remember us, for not many escaped us  alive, and the River had most of those. But it was well for you, for if they  had  not met us,  then the king of the grassland would not have  ridden far,  and if he had there would have been no home to return to.'       'We know it  well,' said Aragorn, 'and never  shall it be forgotten  in  Minas Tirith or in Edoras."
