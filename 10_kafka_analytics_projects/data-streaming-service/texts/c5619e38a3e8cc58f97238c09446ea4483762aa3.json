Often long after the hobbits were wrapped in sleep  they would sit  together under  the stars, recalling  the ages that were gone and  all their  joys  a nd  labours in the world, or holding council, concerning  the days to  come. If any wanderer had chanced  to  pass,  little would he  have seen  or   heard, and it would have seemed to him only that he saw grey figures, carved  in stone, memorials of forgotten  things now  lost in  unpeopled  lands. For  they did  not move or speak with mouth, looking from mind  to mind; and only  their shining eyes stirred and kindled as their thoughts went to and fro.       But at length all was said, and they parted again for a  while, until it  was time for  the Three Rings to  pass away. Quickly fading into  the stones  and  the  shadows  the  grey-cloaked  people  of  Lurien  rode  towards  the  mountains;  and  those  who  were going  to  Rivendell sat  on the hill  and  watched,   until there came out of the gathering mist a flash; and  then they  saw no more. Frodo knew that Galadriel  had held aloft her ring  in token of  farewell.       Sam turned away and sighed: 'I wish I was going back to Lurien!'       At last one  evening  they came over  the  high moors, suddenly  as  to  travellers it always seemed,  to  the brink of the  deep valley of Rivendell   ####-and saw far below the lamps  shining  in Elrond's house. And they went  down  and crossed the bridge and came to  the doors,  and all  the house was filled  with light and song for joy at Elrond's homecoming.       First of  all, before  they  had  eaten or  washed  or even shed  their  cloaks, the hobbits went in search of Bilbo. They found him all alone in his  little room. It was littered with papers and pens and pencils; but Bilbo was  sitting in  a  chair before  a small  bright fire. He looked  very old,  but  peaceful, and sleepy.       He  opened his eyes and  looked up as they came in. 'Hullo, hullo!'  he  said. 'So you've  come back? And  tomorrow's my birthday, too. How clever of  you! Do you know,  I shall  be one hundred and twenty-nine? And  in one year  more, if I am spared, I shall equal the Old Took. I should like to beat him;  but we shall see.'       After the celebration  of  Bilbo's birthday  the four hobbits stayed in  Rivendell for some days, and they sat much with  their old friend, who spent  most  of his time  now in his room,  except at meals. For these he was still  very punctual as a rule, and he seldom failed to wake  up in t ime  for them.  Sitting round the fire they told him in turn all that they could remember of  their journeys and adventures. At first he pretended to take some notes; but  he often fell asleep; and when he  woke  he would  say:  'How splendid!  How  wonderful!  But where were we?'  Then they went  on with  the story from the  point where he had begun to nod.       The only  part that  seemed really to rouse him and  hold his attention  was the account of  the crowning and marriage of Aragorn. 'I was  invited to   the wedding of course,' he said. 'And I have  waited for it long enough. But  somehow, when it came  to it,  I found I had so much to do here; and packing  is such a bother.'       When  nearly a fortnight had passed Frodo  looked out of his window and  saw that  there had been a frost  in the night, and  the  cobwebs were  like  white  nets.  Then  suddenly he knew that he must go,  and  say  good-bye to  Bilbo. The weather  was still calm  and fair, after one  of the  most lovely  summers that people could remember; but October had  come, and it must  break  soon  and begin to rain and blow again. And there was still a very long  way  to go. Yet it was not really the thought of the weather that stirred him. He  had  a feeling  that  it  was time he went back to the Shire. Sam shared it.  Only the night before he had said:   ####-     'Well, Mr. Frodo, we've been far and seen a deal, and yet I don't think   we've found a better place than this. There's  something of everything here,  if  you understand me:  the Shire and the Golden  Wood and  Gondor and kings'  houses and  inns and  meadows and mountains all mixed.  And  yet, somehow,  I  feel we ought to be going soon. I'm worried about my gaffer, to tell you the  truth.'       'Yes,  something  of  everything,  Sam,  except  the  Sea,'   Frodo  had  answered; and he repeated it now to himself: 'Except the Sea.'       That  day  Frodo spoke to Elrond, and  it was  agreed  that they should  leave the next morning. To their delight Gandalf said: 'I think I shall come  too. At least as far as Bree. I want to see Butterbur.'       In  the evening  they went to say good-bye to Bilbo. 'Well, if you must   go, you must,' he said.  'I am sorry.  I shall miss you.  It is nice just to  know that  you are about the  place. But I am getting very sleepy."
