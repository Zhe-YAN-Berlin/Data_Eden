  "text": "  This is too good for that oaf, and you tell him I said so,  he said as he gave her the blade.   I will,  she lied. If she did any such thing, Weese would beat her bloody. Lucan could deliver his own insults.  The longsword was a lot heavier than Needle had been, but Arya liked the feel of it. The weight of steel in her hands made her feel stronger. Maybe I’m not a water dancer yet, but I’m not a mouse either. A mouse couldn’t use a sword but I can. The gates were open, soldiers coming and going, drays rolling in empty and going out creaking and swaying under their loads. She thought about going to the stables and telling them that Ser Lyonel wanted a new horse. She had the paper, the stableboys wouldn’t be able to read it any better than Lucan had. I could take the horse and the sword and just ride out. If the guards tried to stop me I’d show them the paper and say I was bringing everything to Ser Lyonel. She had no notion what Ser Lyonel looked like or where to find him, though. If they questioned her, they’d know, and then Weese… Weese…  As she chewed her lip, trying not to think about how it would feel to have her feet cut off, a group of archers in leather jerkins and iron helms went past, their bows slung across their shoulders. Arya heard snatches of their talk.   …giants I tell you, he’s got giants twenty foot tall come down from beyond the Wall, follow him like dogs…    …not natural, coming on them so fast, in the night and all. He’s more wolf than man, all them Starks are…    …shit on your wolves and giants, the boy’d piss his pants if he knew we was coming. He wasn’t man enough to march on Harrenhal, was he? Ran t’other way, didn’t he? He’d run now if he knew what was best for him.    So you say, but might be the boy knows something we don’t, maybe it’s us ought to be run…   Yes, Arya thought. Yes, it’s you who ought to run, you and Lord Tywin and the Mountain and Ser Addam and Ser Amory and stupid Ser Lyonel whoever he is, all of you better run or my brother will kill you, he’s a Stark, he’s more wolf than man, and so am I.   Weasel.  Weese’s voice cracked like a whip. She never saw where he came from, but suddenly he was right in front of her.  Give me that. Took you long enough.  He snatched the sword from her fingers, and dealt her a stinging slap with the back of his hand.  Next time be quicker about it.   For a moment she had been a wolf again, but Weese’s slap took it all away and left her with nothing but the taste of her own blood in her mouth. She’d bitten her tongue when he hit her. She hated him for that.   You want another?  Weese demanded.  You’ll get it too. I’ll have none of your insolent looks. Get down to the brewhouse and tell Tuffleberry that I have two dozen barrels for him, but he better send his lads to fetch them or I’ll find someone wants ’em worse.  Arya started off, but not quick enough for Weese.  You run if you want to eat tonight,  he shouted, his promises of a plump crisp capon already forgotten.  And don’t be getting lost again, or I swear I’ll beat you bloody.   You won’t, Arya thought. You won’t ever again. But she ran. The old gods of the north must have been guiding her steps. Halfway to the brewhouse, as she passing under the stone bridge that arched between Widow’s Tower and Kingspyre, she heard harsh, growling laughter. Rorge came around a corner with three other men, the manticore badge of Ser Amory sewn over their hearts. When he saw her, he stopped and grinned, showing a mouthful of crooked brown teeth under the leather flap he wore sometimes to cover the hole in his face.  Yoren’s little cunt,  he called her.  Guess we know why that black bastard wanted you on the Wall, don’t we?  He laughed again, and the others laughed with him.  Where’s your stick now?  Rorge demanded suddenly, the smile gone as quick as it had come.  Seems to me I promised to fuck you with it.  He took a step toward her. Arya edged backward.  Not so brave now that I’m not in chains, are you?    I saved you.  She kept a good yard between them, ready to run quick as a snake if he made a grab for her.   Owe you another fucking for that, seems like. Did Yoren pump your cunny, or did he like that tight little ass better?    I’m looking for Jaqen,  she said.  There’s a message.   Rorge halted. Something in his eyes… could it be that he was scared of Jaqen H’ghar?  The bathhouse. Get out of my way.   Arya whirled and ran, swift as a deer, her feet flying over the cobbles all the way to the bathhouse, She found Jaqen soaking in a tub, steam rising around him as a serving girl sluiced hot water over his head. His long hair, red on one side and white on the other, fell down across his shoulders, wet and heavy.  She crept up quiet as a shadow, but he opened his eyes all the same.  She steals in on little mice feet, but a man hears,  he said. How could he hear me? she wondered, and it seemed as if he heard that as well.  The scuff of leather on stone sings loud as warhorns to a man with open ears."
