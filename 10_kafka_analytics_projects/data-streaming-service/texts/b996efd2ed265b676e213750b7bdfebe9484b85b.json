  "text": " 'Some say it  is so far, and some say otherwise. It is a strange road,  and folk are  glad  to reach their  journey's end, whether the time is long or short. But I know  how long it would  take me on  my  own  feet,  with fair  weather and no ill  fortune twelve days from here to the Ford of Bruinen, where the Road crosses  the Loudwater that  runs  out of Rivendell. We  have at  least a fortnight's  journey before us, for I do not think we shall be able to use the Road.'   ####-     'A fortnight!' said Frodo. 'A lot may happen in that time.'       'It may,' said Strider.       They stood for a while silent on the hill-top, near its southward edge.  In  that  lonely  place   Frodo  for  the  first  time  fully  realized  his  homelessness and danger. He wished bitterly that his fortune had left him in  the quiet  and beloved Shire.  He  stared down at the hateful Road,  leading  back westward  - to his  home.  Suddenly he  was aware that  two black specks  were moving slowly along  it,  going westward; and looking again he saw that  three others were creeping eastward to meet them. He gave a cry and clutched  Strider's arm.       'Look,' he said, pointing downwards.        At once Strider flung  himself on  the ground behind the ruined circle,  pulling Frodo down beside him. Merry threw himself alongside.       'What is it?' he whispered.       'I do not know, but I fear the worst,' answered Strider.       Slowly  they crawled  up  to the edge of  the  ring  again,  and peered  through a cleft  between two jagged  stones. The light was no longer bright,  for the clear morning had faded, and clouds creeping out of the East had now  overtaken  the sun,  as it  began to go  down.  They could all see the black   specks, but neither Frodo nor Merry could make out their shapes for certain;  yet something told them that there, far below, were Black  Riders assembling  on the Road beyond the foot of the hill.       'Yes,'  said  Strider,  whose keener sight left him  in no  doubt. 'The  enemy is here!'       Hastily they crept away  and slipped down the north side of the hill to  find their companions.        Sam and  Peregrin had not been  idle. They  had explored the small dell  and the surrounding slopes. Not far away they  found a spring of clear water   in the hillside, and near it footprints not  more than  a day or two old. In  the dell itself they  found  recent traces of a fire, and  other  signs of a   hasty camp. There were some fallen rocks on the edge of  the dell nearest to  the  hill.  Behind  them  Sam  came upon  a  small store of  firewood neatly  stacked.       'I wonder if old Gandalf has been here,' he said to Pippin. 'Whoever it  was put this stuff here meant to come back it seems.'       Strider  was greatly interested in  these discoveries.  'I  wish I  had  waited and explored the  ground  down here myself,' he said, hurrying off to    ####-the spring to examine the footprints.        'It is just as I feared,' he said, when he came back.  'Sam  and Pippin  have trampled the soft ground, and the marks are spoilt or confused. Rangers  have been  here lately. It  is  they who left the firewood behind. But there  are also  several newer tracks  that were not made by Rangers. At least  one   set was made, only a day or two ago, by  heavy boots. At least one. I cannot   now be certain, but  I think  there were many booted feet.'  He  paused  and  stood in anxious thought.       Each of the hobbits  saw in his mind a vision of the cloaked and booted  Riders. If the horsemen had already  found  the dell, the sooner Strider led  them  somewhere else  the better. Sam viewed  the hollow with great dislike,  now that he had heard news of their  enemies on the  Road, only a few  miles  away.       'Hadn't we better clear out quick, Mr.  Strider?' he asked impatiently.  'It  is get ting late,  and  I  don't like this  hole: it makes my heart sink   somehow.'       'Yes,  we certainly must decide what to do  at once,' answered Strider,  looking up and considering the time and the weather. 'Well, Sam,' he said at  last,  'I do not  like  th is  place either; but  I  cannot think of anywhere  better  that we could  reach before nightfall.  At least we are out of sight  for the  moment, and if we moved we should be much more likely to be seen by  spies.  All we could  do would be to go right out  of our way back north  on  this side of the line of hills, where the land is all much the same as it is  here. The  Road  is watched, but we should have to cross it, if we tried  to  take cover  in the thickets away to the south. On the north side of the Road  beyond the hills the country is bare and flat for miles.'       'Can the Riders see?' asked Merry. 'I mean, they seem  usually  to have  used their noses rather than their eyes, smelling for us, if smelling is the  right word, at least in the daylight. But you made us lie down flat when you   saw them down below; and now you talk of being seen, if we move.'       'I was too careless  on the  hill-top,' answered  Strider."
