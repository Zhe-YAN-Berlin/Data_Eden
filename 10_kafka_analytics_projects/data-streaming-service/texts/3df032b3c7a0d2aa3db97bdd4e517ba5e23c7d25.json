  "text": " She could smell him, though; his skin smelled clean and soapy, and he had scented his hair.  A boy becomes a girl,  he murmured.   I was always a girl. I didn’t think you saw me.    A man sees. A man knows.   She remembered that she hated him.  You scared me. You’re one of them now, I should have let you burn. What are you doing here? Go away or I’ll yell for Weese.    A man pays his debts. A man owes three.    Three?    The Red God has his due, sweet girl, and only death may pay for life. This girl took three that were his. This girl must give three in their places. Speak the names, and a man will do the rest.   He wants to help me, Arya realized with a rush of hope that made her dizzy.  Take me to Riverrun, it’s not far, if we stole some horses we could—   He laid a finger on her lips.  Three lives you shall have of me. No more, no less. Three and we are done. So a girl must ponder.  He kissed her hair softly.  But not too long.   By the time Arya lit her stub of a candle, only a faint smell remained of him, a whiff of ginger and cloves lingering in the air. The woman in the next niche rolled over on her straw and complained of the light, so Arya blew it out. When she closed her eyes, she saw faces swimming before her. Joffrey and his mother, Ilyn Payne and Meryn Trant and Sandor Clegane… but they were in King’s Landing hundreds of miles away, and Ser Gregor had lingered only a few nights before departing again for more foraging, taking Raff and Chiswyck and the Tickler with him. Ser Amory Lorch was here, though, and she hated him almost as much. Didn’t she? She wasn’t certain. And there was always Weese.  She thought of him again the next morning, when lack of sleep made her yawn.  Weasel,  Weese purred,  next time I see that mouth droop open, I’ll pull out your tongue and feed it to my bitch.  He twisted her ear between his fingers to make certain she’d heard, and told her to get back to those steps, he wanted them clean down to the third landing by nightfall.  As she worked, Arya thought about the people she wanted dead. She pretended she could see their faces on the steps, and scrubbed harder to wipe them away. The Starks were at war with the Lannisters and she was a Stark, so she should kill as many Lannisters as she could, that was what you did in wars. But she didn’t think she should trust Jaqen. I should kill them myself. Whenever her father had condemned a man to death, he did the deed himself with Ice, his greatsword.  If you would take a man’s life, you owe it to him to look him in the face and hear his last words,  she’d heard him tell Robb and Jon once.  The next day she avoided Jaqen H’ghar, and the day after that. It was not hard. She was very small and Harrenhal was very large, full of places where a mouse could hide.  And then Ser Gregor returned, earlier than expected, driving a herd of goats this time in place of a herd of prisoners. She heard he’d lost four men in one of Lord Beric’s night raids, but those Arya hated returned unscathed and took up residence on the second floor of the Wailing Tower. Weese saw that they were well supplied with drink.  They always have a good thirst, that lot,  he grumbled.  Weasel, go up and ask if they’ve got any clothes that need mending, I’ll have the women see to it.   Arya ran up her well-scrubbed steps. No one paid her any mind when she entered. Chiswyck was seated by the fire with a horn of ale to hand, telling one of his funny stories. She dared not interrupt, unless she wanted a bloody lip.   After the Hand’s tourney, it were, before the war come,  Chiswyck was saying.  We were on our ways back west, seven of us with Ser Gregor. Raff was with me, and young Joss Stilwood, he’d squired for Ser in the lists. Well, we come on this pisswater river, running high on account there’d been rains. No way to ford, but there’s an alehouse near, so there we repair. Ser rousts the brewer and tells him to keep our horns full till the waters fall, and you should see the man’s pig eyes shine at the sight o’ silver. So he’s fetching us ale, him and his daughter, and poor thin stuff it is, no more’n brown piss, which don’t make me any happier, nor Ser neither. And all the time this brewer’s saying how glad he is to have us, custom being slow on account o’ them rains. The fool won’t shut his yap, not him, though Ser is saying not a word, just brooding on the Knight o’ Pansies and that bugger’s trick he played. You can see how tight his mouth sits, so me and the other lads we know better’n to say a squeak to him, but this brewer he’s got to talk, he even asks how m’lord fared in the jousting. Ser just gave him this look.  Chiswyck cackled, quaffed his ale, and wiped the foam away with the back of his hand.  Meanwhile, this daughter of his has been fetching and pouring, a fat little thing, eighteen or so—    Thirteen, more like,  Raff the Sweetling drawled.   Well, be that as it may, she’s not much to look at, but Eggon’s been drinking and gets to touching her, and might be I did a little touching meself, and Raff’s telling young Stilwood that he ought t’ drag the girl upstairs and make hisself a man, giving the lad courage as it were."
