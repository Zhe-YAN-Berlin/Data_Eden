Part of you is Summer, and part of Summer is you. You know that, Bran.   Summer rushed forward, but Meera blocked him, jabbing with the three-pronged spear. The wolf twisted aside, circling, stalking. Meera turned to face him.  Call him back, Bran.    Summer!  Bran shouted.  To me, Summer!  He slapped an open palm down on the meat of his thigh. His hand tingled, though his dead leg felt nothing.  The direwolf lunged again, and again Meera’s spear darted out. Summer dodged, circled back. The bushes rustled, and a lean black shape came padding from behind the weirwood, teeth bared. The scent was strong; his brother had smelled his rage. Bran felt hairs rise on the back of his neck. Meera stood beside her brother, with wolves to either side.  Bran, call them off.    I can’t!    Jojen, up the tree.    There’s no need. Today is not the day I die.    Do it!  she screamed, and her brother scrambled up the trunk of the weirwood, using the face for his handholds. The direwolves closed. Meera abandoned spear and net, jumped up, and grabbed the branch above her head. Shaggy’s jaws snapped shut beneath her ankle as she swung up and over the limb. Summer sat back on his haunches and howled, while Shaggydog worried the net, shaking it in his teeth.  Only then did Bran remember that they were not alone. He cupped hands around his mouth.  Hodor!  he shouted.  Hodor! Hodor!  He was badly frightened and somehow ashamed.  They won’t hurt Hodor,  he assured his treed friends.  A few moments passed before they heard a tuneless humming. Hodor arrived half-dressed and mud-spattered from his visit to the hot pools, but Bran had never been so glad to see him.  Hodor, help me. Chase off the wolves. Chase them off.   Hodor went to it gleefully, waving his arms and stamping his huge feet, shouting  Hodor, Hodor,  running first at one wolf and then the other. Shaggydog was the first to flee, slinking back into the foliage with a final snarl. When Summer had enough, he came back to Bran and lay down beside him.  No sooner did Meera touch ground than she snatched up her spear and net again. Jojen never took his eyes off Summer.  We will talk again,  he promised Bran.  It was the wolves, it wasn’t me. He did not understand why they’d gotten so wild. Maybe Maester Luwin was right to lock them in the godswood.  Hodor,  he said,  bring me to Maester Luwin.   The maester’s turret below the rookery was one of Bran’s favorite places. Luwin was hopelessly untidy, but his clutter of books and scrolls and bottles was as familiar and comforting to Bran as his bald spot and the flapping sleeves of his loose grey robes. He liked the ravens too.  He found Luwin perched on a high stool, writing. With Ser Rodrik gone, all of the governance of the castle had fallen on his shoulders.  My prince,  he said when Hodor entered,  you’re early for lessons today.  The maester spent several hours every afternoon tutoring Bran, Rickon, and the Walder Freys.   Hodor, stand still.  Bran grasped a wall sconce with both hands and used it to pull himself up and out of the basket. He hung for a moment by his arms until Hodor carried him to a chair.  Meera says her brother has the greensight.   Maester Luwin scratched at the side of his nose with his writing quill.  Does she now?   He nodded.  You told me that the children of the forest had the greensight. I remember.    Some claimed to have that power. Their wise men were called greenseers.    Was it magic?    Call it that for want of a better word, if you must. At heart it was only a different sort of knowledge.    What was it?   Luwin set down his quill.  No one truly knows, Bran. The children are gone from the world, and their wisdom with them. It had to do with the faces in the trees, we think. The First Men believed that the greenseers could see through the eyes of the weirwoods. That was why they cut down the trees whenever they warred upon the children. Supposedly the greenseers also had power over the beasts of the wood and the birds in the trees. Even fish. Does the Reed boy claim such powers?    No. I don’t think. But he has dreams that come true sometimes, Meera says.    All of us have dreams that come true sometimes. You dreamed of your lord father in the crypts before we knew he was dead, remember?    Rickon did too. We dreamed the same dream.    Call it greensight, if you wish… but remember as well all those tens of thousands of dreams that you and Rickon have dreamed that did not come true. Do you perchance recall what I taught you about the chain collar that every maester wears?   Bran thought for a moment, trying to remember.  A maester forges his chain in the Citadel of Oldtown. It’s a chain because you swear to serve, and it’s made of different metals because you serve the realm and the realm has different sorts of people. Every time you learn something you get another link."
