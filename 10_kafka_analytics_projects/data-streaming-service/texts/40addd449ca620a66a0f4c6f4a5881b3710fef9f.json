But none  were unmoved; none rejected its  pleas and its commands without  an effort  of mind and will, so long as  its  master had control of it.        'Well?' it  said now with  gentle  question. 'Why  must  you disturb my  rest? Will you give me no peace  at  all by night or day?' Its tone was that  of a kindly heart aggrieved by injuries undeserved.       They  looked up, astonished, for they had heard no sound of his coming;   ####-and they saw a figure standing at the  rail, looking  down upon them: an old  man, swathed in a great cloak, the colour of which was not easy to tell, for   it changed if they  moved  their eyes or if  he stirred. His  face was long,  with  a high forehead, he had deep darkling eyes, hard to fathom, though the  look  that they now  bore was grave and benevolent, and a  little weary. His  hair and beard were white, but strands of black still showed about his  lips  and ears.       'Like, and yet unlike,' muttered Gimli.       'But come now,' said the  soft voice. 'Two  at least of  you I know  by  name.  Gandalf  I know too  well to  have much  hope that  he seeks help  or   counsel here. But you, Thjoden Lord  of  the Mark  of Rohan are  declared by  your noble devices, and still more by  the fair  countenance of the House of  Eorl.  O worthy son of  Thengel the  Thrice-renowned! Why have you not   come  before, and as a friend? Much  have  I desired to see you, mightiest king of  western lands, and especially  in these latter years, to  save you from  the  unwise and evil counsels that beset  you!  Is it yet  too late? Despite  the  injuries that have been done to me, in  which the  men of Rohan, alas!  have  had some part, still  I  would save you, and deliver you from the ruin  that  draws nigh inevitably,  if you  ride  upon this  road which you have  taken.  Indeed I alone can aid you now.'       Thjoden opened his mouth as if to speak, but he said nothing. He looked  up  at the face of Saruman with its dark solemn eyes bent down upon him, and  then to Gandalf at his  side; and  he  seemed to hesitate. Gandalf  made  no   sign; but stood silent as stone, as one waiting patiently for some call that  has not  yet  come. The Riders stirred at first, murmuring with approval  of  the words of Saruman; and then they too were silent,  as men spell-bound. It   seemed to them that Gandalf had never spoken so  fair and fittingly to their  lord.  Rough and proud  now seemed all his  dealings with  Thjoden. And over   their hearts crept a shadow, the fear of a great danger: the end of the Mark  in a  darkness to which Gandalf was driving them, while Saruman stood beside  a door of  escape, holding it half open so that a ray of light came through.  There was a heavy silence.       It was Gimli the dwarf who broke in suddenly. 'The words of this wizard  stand on their heads,'  he growled, gripping  the handle of his axe. 'In the  language  of  Orthanc  help  means ruin, and  saving means  slaying, that is  plain. But we do not come here to beg.'   ####-     'Peace!'  said Saruman, and for  a  fleeting  moment his voice was less  suave, and a  light flickered in his eyes and was gone.  'I do not  speak to  you  yet,  Gimli  Gluin's son,' he said. 'Far  away  is  your home and small  concern of yours are the  troubles of this land. But it was not by design of  your own that  you  became  embroiled in them, and so I will  not blame such  part as you have played-a valiant one, I doubt not. But I pray you, allow me   first to speak with the King of Rohan, my neighbour, and once my friend.       'What  have you to say,  Thjoden King? Will you have peace with me, and  all  the aid that my  knowledge, founded in  long years, can bring? Shall we  make our counsels together  against  evil days, and repair our injuries with  such good will that our  estates  shall both come to fairer flower than ever  before?'       Still Thjoden  did not  answer.  Whether he strove with anger or  doubt  none could say. Jomer spoke.       'Lord, hear me!'  he said.  'Now  we feel the peril that we  were warned  of. Have we ridden forth to victory, only to stand at last amazed  by an old  liar with honey on his forked tongue? So would the trapped wolf speak to the  hounds,  if he could. What aid can he give  to you, forsooth? All he desires  is  to  escape  from  his plight. But will you  parley  with this dealer  in  treachery and murder? Remember Thjodred at  the Fords, and the grave of  Hbma   in Helm's Deep!'       'If  we speak of  poisoned tongues what  shall  we say of  yours, young  serpent?' said Saruman,  and the  flash of  his  anger was now plain to see.  'But  come,  Jomer, Jomund's  son!' he went on in his soft  voice again.  To  every man h part. Valour in  arms is yours, and you win high honour thereby.  Slay whom your lord names as enemies, and be content. Meddle not in policies  which you do not understand. But maybe. if you become  a king, you Will find  that he must choose his friends with care."
