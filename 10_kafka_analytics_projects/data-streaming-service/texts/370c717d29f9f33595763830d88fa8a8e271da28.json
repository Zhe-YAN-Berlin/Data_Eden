They saw the barrier and laughed. They did not imagine that  ther e  was anything in  this little  land  that would stand up to  twenty of  their kind together.       The hobbits  opened the barrier and stood aside.  'Thank you!' the  Men  jeered. 'Now run home to bed before you're whipped.' Then they marched along  the street  shouting: 'Put those lights out! Get indoors  and stay there! Or  we'll take fifty  of you  to the Lockholes for  a year. Get in!  The Boss is  losing his temper.'       No one paid any heed to their orders; but as the  ruffians passed, they  closed in  qu ietly behind and followed them.  When the  Men reached the fire  there was Farmer Cotton standing all alone warming his hands.       'Who  are   you,  and  what   d'you   think  you're  doing?'  said  the  ruffian-leader.       Farmer Cotton looked at him slowly. 'I was just going to ask you that,'  he said. 'This isn't your country, and you're not wanted.'       'Well, you're wanted  anyhow,' said the leader. 'We want you.  Take him   ####-lads! Lockholes for him, and give him something to keep him quiet!'       The Men took one step forward  and stopped short. There rose a  roar of  voices all round them,  and suddenly  they were aware that Farmer Cotton was  not  all  alone. They  were surrounded.  In  the dark  on  the  edge  of the  firelight stood a ring  of hobbits  that had crept  up out  of  the shadows.  There was nearly two hundred of them, all holding some weapon.       Merry stepped  forward. 'We have met before,' he  said  to  the leader,  'and I warned you not to come  back here. I warn you again: you are standing  in  the  light and you are covered  by archers. If you lay a finger on  this  farmer, or on anyone  else, you will be  shot at once.  Lay down any weapons  that you have!'       The leader looked round. He was trapped. But he was not scared, not now  with a score of his fellows to  back  him.  He knew too little of hobbits to  understand his peril.  Foolishly he  decided to  fight. It  would be easy to  break out.       'At 'em lads!' he cried. 'Let 'em have it!'       With a  long knife in his left hand and a  club in  the other he made a   rush  at the  ring, trying  to burst out back towards Hobbiton.  He aimed  a   savage blow at Merry who stood in his way.  He fell dead with four arrows in  him:       That was enough for the others.  They gave in. Their weapons were taken   from them, and they were roped  together,  and marched  off to  an empty hut  that they had built themselves, and there they were tied hand  and foot, and  locked up under guard. The dead leader was dragged off and buried.       'Seems almost too easy  after all, don't it?' said Cotton.  'I said  we  could master them. But we needed a call. You came  back in the nick o' time,  Mr. Merry.'       'There's more to be done still,' said Merry. 'If  you're  right in your  reckoning, we haven't dealt with a tithe of them yet. But it's  dark now.  I  think the  next stroke must  wait  until morning. Then  we must  call on the  Chief.'       'Why not  now?' said Sam.  'It's not much more than  six o'clock. And I  want to see my gaffer. D'you know what's come of him, Mr. Cotton?'       'He's not too  well,  and not too bad, Sam,' said the farmer. 'They dug  up Bagshot Row, and that  was a sad blow  to  him. He's in one of  them  new  houses that  the Chief's Men  used to  build while  they still did any  work  other than burning and thieving:  not  above a mile from the end of Bywater.   ####-But he comes around to me, when he gets a chance,  and I see he's better fed  than some of the poor bodies. All against The Rules, of course. I'd have had  him with me, but that wasn't allowed.'       'Thank'ee indeed, Mr. Cotton, and I'll never forget it,' said Sam. 'But  I want to see him. That Boss and that Sharkey, as they  spoke of, they might   do a mischief up there before the morning.'       'All right, Sam,' said Cotton.  'Choose a  lad or two, and go and fetch  him to my  house. You'll not have need to  go near the old  Hobbiton village  over Water. My Jolly here will show you.'       Sam went off. Merry arranged for look -outs round the village and guards  at  the barriers during  the  night. Then he and Frodo went off with  Farmer   Cotton. They sat with  the family in the warm kitchen, and the Cottons asked  a  few polite  questions about  their travels,  but hardly  listened  to the  answers: they were far more concerned with events in the Shire.       'It all began with Pimple, as we call him,' said Farmer Cotton; 'and it  began as soon as you'd  gone off, Mr. Frodo.  He'd funny  ideas had  Pimple.  Seems he wanted to own everything himself, and  then order other folk about.  It soon came out that he already did own a sight more than was good for him;  and  he was  always grabbing  more, though  where he got  the  money  was  a   mystery:  mills and malt-houses and  inns,  and farms, and leaf-plantations."
