  "text": " So say I, Peregrin son of Paladin of the Shire of the Halflings.'       And this do I hear, Denethor son of Ecthelion, Lord  of Gondor, Steward  of the High King, and I will not forget it, nor fail to reward that which is  given: fealty with love, valour with honour, oath - breaking with vengeance.'  Then Pippin received back his sword and put it in its sheath.       'And now,' said  Denethor, 'my first command  to you: speak and be  not  silent! Tell me your full tale, and see that you recall all that  you can of  Boromir, my son. Sit now and begin!' As he  spoke  he  struck a small silver   gong  that  stood  near his footstool,  and at  once  servants came forward.  Pippin saw then that they had been standing in alcoves on either side of the  door, unseen as he and Gandalf entered.       'Bring wine and food and seats for the guests,' said Denethor, 'and see  that none trouble us for one hour.'       'It is all that  I have to spare,  for there is  much else to heed,' he  said  to Gandalf.  'Much of more import,  it  may seem,  and yet to  me less   ####-pressing. But maybe we can speak again at the end of the day.'       'And earlier, it is to  be hoped,' said Gandalf. 'For I have not ridden  hither from Isengard, one hundred and fifty leagues, with the speed of wind,   only to bring you one small warrior, however courteous.  Is it naught to you   that Thjoden has fought a great battle and  that Isengard is overthrown, and  that I have broken the staff of Saruman?'       'It is much to me. But I know already  sufficient of these deeds for my  own  counsel  against  the menace of the East.' He turned his  dark  eyes on  Gandalf, and now  Pippin  saw a likeness between  the  two, and he  felt the  strain between them,  almost as if  he saw a line of smouldering fire, drawn  from eye to eye, that might suddenly burst into flame.       Denethor  looked indeed much more like a great wizard than Gandalf did,  more kingly,  beautiful, and powerful; and older. Yet  by a sense other than  sight  Pippin perceived that  Gandalf had  the greater power and the  deeper  wisdom, and a majesty that  was veiled.  And he was  older, far older.  'How  much older?' he wondered, and  then  he thought  how odd it was that he  had  never thought about it before. Treebeard had  said  something about wizards,  but even  then  he  had  not  thought of Gandalf as  one  of them. What  was  Gandalf? In what  far  time and place did he come  into  the world, and when  would he leave it? And  then his musings broke off, and he saw that Denethor   and Gandalf  still looked each other in the eye, as if  reading the  other's  mind. But it was Denethor who first withdrew his gaze.       'Yea,' he  said; 'for though  the Stones  be lost, they say,  still the  lords of Gondor have keener sight than lesser men, and many messages come  to  them. But sit now!'       Then men came bearing a chair and a low stool, and one brought a salver   with  a  silver flagon  and cups,  and  white cakes. Pippin sat down, but he  could  not  take his eyes  from  the  old lord.  Was it so, or  had  he only  imagined it, that  as he spoke of the Stones a sudden gleam  of his  eye had  glanced upon Pippin's face?        'Now tell  me your tale,  my  liege,' said Denethor, half  kindly; half  mockingly. 'For the words  of one whom my son so befriended will be   welcome  indeed.'       Pippin never forgot that hour in the great  hall under the piercing eye  of the Lord of  Gondor,  stabbed ever and anon by his  shrewd questions, and   ####-all the while conscious of  Gandalf at his side, watching and listening, and  (so Pippin felt) holding  in check a rising  wrath and impatience.  When the  hour was  over and Denethor again rang  the gong, Pippin felt worn out.  'It  cannot  be  more  than  nine o'clock,'  he thought.  'I  could now eat three  breakfasts on end.'       'Lead  the  Lord  Mithrandir  to  the housing prepared for  him,'  said  Denethor, 'and his companion may lodge with him for the present, if he will.   But  be it known that  I have  now sworn him to  my service, and he shall be  known as Peregrin son of Paladin and taught the lesser pass-words. Send word  to the Captains that they shall wait on me here, as soon as may be after the  third hour has rung.       'And  you,  my Lord  Mithrandir, shall come too, as and when  you will.  None shall hinder your coming to me at any time, save only in my brief hours  of sleep. Let your wrath at an old man's folly run off and then return to my  comfort!'       'Folly?'  said  Gandalf. 'Nay,  my lord, when you are a dotard you will  die. You can  use  even your grief as  a cloak.  Do you  think that I do not  understand your purpose in  questioning for an hour one who knows the least,  while I sit by?'       'If you understand  it,  then  be  content,' returned  Denethor. 'Pride  would  be  folly that disdained help and counsel  at need; but you deal  out  such gifts according to your own designs. Yet  the Lord of Gondor  is not to   be made the tool  of other men's purposes, however worthy."
