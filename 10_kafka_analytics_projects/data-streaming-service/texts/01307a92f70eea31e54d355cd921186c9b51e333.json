Then he  threw  his  staff  on the  ground, and  sat down  in  silence.       At that moment from far off the  wind bore to their listening ears  the  howling of wolves. Bill the pony started in fear, and Sam sprang to his side  and whispered softly to him.       'Do not let him run away! ' said Boromir. 'It seems that we  shall need  him still, if the wolves do not  find us. How  I  hate  this foul pool! ' He  stooped and picking up a large stone he cast it far into the dark water.       The stone vanished with a soft slap; but at  the same instant there was  a swish and a bubble. Great rippling rings formed on the surface  out beyond   where the stone had fallen, and they moved slowly towards  the  foot  of the  cliff.       'Why did  you do  that, Boromir? ' said Frodo. `I hate this place, too,  and I am afraid. I don't know of what: not of wolves, or the dark behind the  doors, but of something else. I am afraid of the pool. Don't disturb it! '       'l wish we could get away! ' said Merry.       'Why doesn't Gandalf do something quick? ' said Pippin.       Gandalf took no notice of them. He sat  with his head bowed,  either in  despair or in anxious thought. The mournful howling of the wolves was  heard  again. The ripples  on the water  grew and came  closer;  some were  already   lapping on the shore.       With a suddenness that startled them all the wizard sprang to his feet.  He was laughing! `I have it! '  he  cried. 'Of  course, of  course! Absurdly  simple, like most riddles when you see the answer.'       Picking up  his  staff he  stood before  the rock and  said  in  a clear  voice: Mellon!       The  star  shone  out briefly  and faded again.  Then silently  a great  doorway was  outlined, though not a  crack or joint had been visible before.  Slowly it divided in the middle and swung outwards inch  by inch, until both   doors lay back against the wall.  Through the opening a shadowy stair  could   be seen climbing steeply up; but  beyond the  lower  steps the darkness  was  deeper than the night. The Company stared in wonder.       `I was wrong after all,' said  Gandalf, 'and Gimli  too. Merry, of  all  people, was on  the  right track.  The  opening word  was  inscribed on  the  archway  all the time!  The translation  should have been:  Say \"Friend\" and  enter. I had only to speak the Elvish word for friend and the  doors opened.  Quite simple. Too simple for a learned lore-master in these suspicious days.    ####-Those were happier times. Now let us go!'       He strode  forward  and  set his foot  on the lowest  step. But at that  moment several things happened. Frodo felt something seize  him by the ankle,  and he fell with a cry. Bill  the pony gave a wild neigh of fear, and turned  tail and dashed away along the lakeside into the darkness. Sam leaped  after   him, and  then hearing Frodo's cry  he ran back again, weeping  and cursing.   The others swung round and saw the waters of the lake seething, as if a host   of snakes were swimming up from the southern end.       Out  from  the  water  a  long sinuous  tentacle had  crawled;  it  was  pale-green  and luminous and wet.  Its fingered end had ho ld of Frodo's foot   and was dragging him into the water. Sam on his knees was now slashing at it  with a knife.       The arm  let go of Frodo, and Sam pulled him away, crying out for help.  Twenty others arms came rippling out. The dark water boiled, and there was a   hideous stench.       `Into  the gateway!  Up  the stairs!  Quick! ' shouted Gandalf  leaping  back. Rousing them from the horror that seemed to have rooted all but Sam to  the ground where they stood, he drove them forward.       They were  just in time. Sam and  Frodo were  only  a few steps up, and  Gandalf had just  begun to climb, when the groping tentacles writhed  across  the  narrow  shore  and  fingered  the cliff-wall  and  the  doors. One came  wriggling over  the  threshold, glistening in  the starlight. Gandalf turned  and paused. If he  was considering what word would close the gate again from  within, there  was no  need. Many  coiling  arms seized the  doors on either   side, and with horrible strength, swung them round.  With a shattering  echo  they slammed,  and all  light was lost. A noise of rending and crashing came  dully through the ponderous stone.       Sam,  clinging  to  Frodo's arm, collapsed  on  a  step  in  the  black   darkness.  `Poor old  Bill!  ' he said in a choking  voice. `Poor   old Bill!  Wolves  and snakes! But the snakes were too much for him.  I  had to choose,  Mr. Frodo. I had to come with you.'       They heard Gandalf go back down  the steps and thrust his staff against  the doors. There was a quiver in the stone and the stairs trembled, .but the  doors did  not open. `Well, well! ' said the wizard. `The passage is blocked  behind  us now  and there is only one  way  out--on  the other  side  of the  mountains."
