When he came out he  was  bearing in  his  arms a  great  load of  treasure:  things  of  gold, silver,  copper, and bronze; many beads and chains and jewelled ornaments. He  climbed  the green barrow and laid them all on top in the sunshine.       There he stood, with his hat in his hand  and the wind in his hair, and  looked down upon the  three hobbits, that had been  laid on their backs upon  the grass at the west side of the mound. Raising his right hand he said in a   clear and commanding voice:       Wake now my merry tads! Wake and hear me calling!       Warm now be heart and limb! The cold stone is fallen;       Dark door is standing wide; dead hand is broken.   ####-     Night under Night is flown, and the Gate is open!       To Frodo's great joy the hobbits  stirred, stretched their arms, rubbed  their eyes, and  then suddenly  sprang up. They  looked  about in amazement,  first  at Frodo, and then at Tom standing  large  as life on  the barrow-top  above  them; and then  at  themselves in their thin  white rags, crowned and  belted with pale gold, and jingling with trinkets.        'What in  the name of  wonder?' began Merry, feeling the golden circlet  that had slipped over  one  eye. Then he stopped, and a shadow came over his  face, and he closed his eyes. 'Of course, I remember!' he  said. 'The men of  Carn  Dym came on  us at  night,  and  we were worsted. Ah! the spear  in my  heart!'  He  clutched at his  breast. 'No! No!'  he said,  opening his eyes.   'What am I saying? I have been dreaming. Where did you get to, Frodo?'       'I thought that I  was lost,' said Frodo; 'but I don't want to speak of  it. Let us think of what we are to do now! Let us go on!'       'Dressed up like this, sir?' said Sam. 'Where are my clothes?' He flung  his circlet, belt, and  rings on the grass, and looked round helplessly,  as  if  he  expected  to  find  his  cloak,  jacket,  and  breeches,  and  other   hobbit-garments lying somewhere to hand.       'You won't find  your clothes again,' said  Tom, bounding down from the  mound, and laughing as he danced round them in the  sunlight. One would have  thought  that  nothing dangerous  or dreadful  had happened;  and indeed the  horror faded  out of their  hearts as they looked at him, and saw the  merry  glint in his eyes.       'What do you mean?' asked Pippin, looking at him, half puzzled and half  amused. 'Why not?'       But Tom shook his  head, saying: 'You've found yourselves again, out of  the deep water. Clothes are but little loss, if you escape from drowning. Be  glad,  my merry friends, and let the warm sunlight heal now  heart and limb!   Cast off these cold rags! Run naked on the grass, while Tom goes a -hunting!'       He sprang away down hill, whistling and calling. Looking down after him  Frodo saw him  running away southwards along the green  hollow between  their  hill and the next, still whistling and crying:       Hey! now! Come hoy now! Whither do you wander?       Up, down, near or far, here, there or yonder?       Sharp-ears, Wise-nose, Swish-tail and Bumpkin,       White-socks my little lad, and old Fatty Lumpkin!   ####-     So he sang, running fast, tossi ng up his hat  and catching it, until he  was hidden  by a fold of the ground: but for some time his hey now! hoy now!  came floating back down the wind, which had shifted round towards the south.       The air was growing very warm again. The hobbits ran  about for a while  on the grass,  as he  told them. Then they lay basking  in the  sun with the  delight of  those  that have been wafted  suddenly  from bitter winter to  a   friendly clime, or of people that, after  being long ill and bedridden, wake  one day to find that they are unexpectedly well and the day is again full of  promise.       By the time that Tom returned they were feeling strong (and hungry). He  reappeared, hat first, over  the brow of the hill, and behind him came in an  obedient line six  ponies: their own five and one more. The last was plainly  old Fatty Lumpkin: he was larger, stronger,  fatter  (and older)  than their  own ponies. Merry, to whom the others belonged, had not, in fact, given them  any such names, but they answered  to the  new names that Tom had given  them  for the rest of  their  lives. Tom called  them one by  one and they climbed  over the brow and stood in a line. Then Tom bowed to the hobbits.        'Here are your ponies, now!' he  said.  'They've  more  sense (in  some  ways) than you  wandering hobbits have  - more sense in their noses. For they  sniff  danger ahead which  you walk  right  into; and if  they  run to  save  themselves, then they run  the  right  way.  You must forgive  them all; for   though their hearts are faithful,  to  face fear of Barrow-wights is not what  they were made for. See, here they come again, bringing all their burdens!'       Merry, Sam,  and Pippin now clothed themselves  in spare  garments from  their  packs; and they soon felt too hot, for  they  were  obliged to put on  some  of  the thicker  and warmer things  that they had  brought against the  oncoming of winter."
