Westward, to his  right, it turned, skirting the shoulders of the mountains,   and  went off southwards into  the deep shadows that mantled all the western  sides of Ephel D®ath; beyond his sight it journeyed on  into the narrow land  between the mountains and the Great River.       As he gazed Frodo became aware that there was a great stir and movement  on the plain. It seemed as if whole armies were on the march, though for the   ####-most part they were hidden by the reeks and fumes drifting from the fens and  wastes beyond. But here and there he caught the gleam of spears and helmets;   and over the levels beside  the roads horsemen could be seen  riding in many   companies.  He  remembered his  vision from afar upon Amon Hen,  so few  days  before, though now it seemed many years ago. Then he knew that the hope that  had for one wild  moment stirred in his heart was vain. The trumpets had not   rung in challenge but in greeting. This was no assault upon the Dark Lord by  the men of Gondor, risen like avenging ghosts from the graves of valour long  passed away. These were Men  of  other  race, out  of  the  wide  Eastlands,  gathering  to the summons of their Overlord; armies that had encamped before  his  Gate by  night  and  now marched in to swell  his mounting power. As if  suddenly made fully  aware of the  peril  of their  position, alone,  in the  growing light of day, so near  to this  vast menace, Frodo quickly drew  his  frail grey hood close upon his head, and stepped down into the dell. Then he  turned to Gollum.       `Smjagol,' he said, `I will trust you once more. lndeed it seems that I  must do so,  and that it is my fate to receive help from you. where  I least   looked  for  it, and  your  fate to help me whom you long  pursued with evil  purpose.  So far  you have deserved well  of me  and have kept your  promise  truly. Truly, I say and mean,' he added with a glance at Sam, 'for twice now  we have been in your  power, and  you have  done no harm to us. Nor have you   tried to take  from  me what you once sought.  May the third time  prove the  best! But I warn you, Smjagol, you are in danger.'       `Yes, yes,  master!  '  said Gollum. `Dreadful  danger! Smjagol's bones  shake to think of it. but he doesn't run away. He must help nice master.'       'I  did not mean  the danger that we all  share,' said Frodo. 'I mean a   danger to yourself alone. You swore a promise by what you call the Precious.   Remember tha t! It will hold you to it; but it will seek a way to twist it to  your own undoing. Already you are being twisted. You revealed yourself to me  just  now, foolishly.  Give it back  to  Smjagol you  said. Do  not say that  again! Do not let that thought grow in you! You will  never get it back. But  the desire of it may betray you to a bitter end. You will never get it back.  In  the last need, Smjagol, I should put  on the Precious; and the  Precious  mastered you  long ago. If  I,  wearing  it, were to  command you, you would  obey, even if it were to leap from a precipice  or to cast yourself into the  fire. And such would be my command. So have a care, Smjagol!'   ####-     Sam looked at his  master with approval, but also with surprise:  there  was a look in his face and a tone in his voice that he had not known before.  It had  always been a notion  of his that the kindness of dear Mr. Frodo was  of  such a high  degree that it  must imply a fair measure of  blindness. Of  course, he  also  firmly held the incompatible belief that Mr. Frodo was the  wisest person in the world (with the possible exception of Old Mr. Bilbo and  of Gandalf). Gollum in  his  own  way,  and with  much  more excuse  as  his  acquaintance was  much briefer, may have _made a  similar mistake, confusing  kindness and blindness.  At any rate  this speech abashed and terrified him.  He grovelled on the ground and could speak no clear words but nice master.       Frodo waited patiently for a while,  then he spoke again less  sternly.  `Come now, Gollum  or Smjagol if  you wish, tell  me of this other way,  and  show me,  if you can,  what hope  there is in  it,  enough to justify me  in  turning aside from my plain path. I am in haste.'       But  Gollum  was in  a  pitiable state, and  Frodo's  threat  had quite  unnerved  him. It was not easy to get any clear account out of him, amid his  mumblings and squeakings, and the frequent interruptions in which he crawled  on the floor and begged them both to be kind to `poor little Smjagol'. After   a  while he grew a  little calmer, and Frodo gathered bit by bit that, if  a   traveller followed the road  that turned west of Ephel D®ath,  he would come  in  time to a  crossing in a circle of  dark trees. On the right a road went  down to Osgiliath and the bridges of the Anduin; in the middle the road went  on southwards.        `On,  on,  on,'  said Gollum."
