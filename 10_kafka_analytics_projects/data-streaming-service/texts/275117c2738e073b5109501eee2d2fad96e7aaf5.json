I  was so startled that I hardly had the wits to hide myself in a more ordinary  fashion; but  I got through the hedge and walked along the  field inside.  I  was  peeping  through into the road,  after the S.-B.s  had  passed, and was  looking  straight at Bilbo  when he suddenly reappeared. I caught a glint of  gold as he put something back in his trouser -pocket.       'After that I kept my  eyes open.  In fact, I confess that I spied. But  you must  admit that it was very  intriguing, and I was only in my teens.  I  must be the only one in the Shire, besides you Frodo, that has ever seen the  old fellow's secret book.'       'You have read his book!' cried Frodo.  'Good heavens above! Is nothing  safe?'       'Not  too safe, I should say,' said  Merry.  'But  I have  only had one  rapid glance, and that was difficult to get. He never left the book about. I  wonder what became  of it. I should  like  another look.  Have you  got  it,  Frodo?'       'No. It was not at Bag End. He must have taken it away.'       'Well, as  I  was saying,' Merry  proceeded, 'I  kept my  knowledge  to  myself,  till  this Spring  when  things got  serious. Then  we  formed  our  conspiracy;  and  as we were serious, too,  and meant business,  we have not   been too scrupulous. You are  not a very easy  nut to crack,  and Gandalf is  worse. But if  you want to be  introduced  to our chief investigator, I  can  produce him.'       'Where is  he?' said  Frodo, looking round, as if he  expected a masked  and sinister figure to come out of a cupboard.   ####-     'Step forward, Sam!'  said Merry; and  Sam stood up with a face scarlet  up to  the ears.  'Here's our collector of  information! And he  collected a   lot, I  can tell you, before he was finally  caught. After which, I may say,  he seemed to regard himself as on parole, and dried up.'       'Sam!' cried  Frodo,  feeling that amazement could  go no  further, and  quite  unable  to decide whether he felt angry,  amused, relieved, or merely  foolish.       'Yes, sir!' said Sam.  'Begging your pardon, sir! But I meant  no wrong  to you, Mr.  Frodo, nor to Mr. Gandalf  for that matter. He  has some sense,  mind you; and when you  said  go alone, he  said no! lake someone as you can  trust.'       'But it does not seem that I can trust anyone,' said Frodo.  Sam looked  at him unhappily.  'It all depends on what you want,' put in Merry. 'You can  trust us to stick to you through thick and thin - to the bitter end. And you   can trust us to keep any secret of yours  - closer than you keep it yourself.   But you cannot trust us to let you face trouble alone, and go off  without a   word. We  are your friends, Frodo. Anyway: there it is. We know most of what  Gandalf has  told you. We know  a good deal about the Ring. We  are horribly  afraid - but we are coming with you; or following you like hounds.'       'And after all, sir,'  added Sam,  'you did  ought to  take the  Elves'  advice.  Gildor said you should take them as was willing, and you can't deny  it.'       'I don't deny it,' said Frodo, looking at Sam, who was now grinning. 'I  don't  deny it, but I'll never believe you  are  sleeping again, whether you   snore or not. I shall kick you hard to make sure.       'You are a set  of deceitful  scoundrels!'  he  said,  turning  to  the  others.  'But bless you!' he laughed, getting up and waving his arms, 'I give  in. I will take Gildor's  advice.  If the danger were not  so dark, I should  dance for joy. Even so,  I cannot  help feeling  happy; happier than I  have  felt for a long time. I had dreaded this evening.'       'Good!  That's  settled. Three cheers  for  Captain Frodo and company!'  they shouted;  and  they  danced round him. Merry and  Pippin  began a song,  which they had apparently got ready for the occasion.       It was made on  the model of the dwarf-song that started Bilbo  on  his  adventure long ago, and went to the same tune:       Farewell we call to hearth and hall!       Though wind may blow and rain may fall,   ####-     We must away ere break of day       Far over wood and mountain tall.         To Rivendell, where Elves yet dwell       In glades beneath the misty fell,       Through moor and waste we ride in haste,       And whither then we cannot tell.         With foes ahead, behind us dread,       Beneath the sky shall be our bed,       Until at last our toil be passed,       Our journey done, our errand sped.         We must away! We must away!       We ride before the break of day!       'Very good!' said Frodo. 'But in that case there are a lot of things to  do before we go to bed - under a roof, for  tonight at any rate.'       'Oh! That was poetry!' said Pippin. 'Do you really mean to start before  the break of day?'       'I don't know,' answered  Frodo. 'I fear those  Black Riders, and  I am  sure it is unsafe to stay in one place long, especially in  a place to which  it is known  I was going."
