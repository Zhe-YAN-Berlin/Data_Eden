O reed by the living pool! Fair River-daughter!       O spring-time and summer-time, and spring again after!       O wind on the waterfall, and the leaves' laughter!'        Suddenly he  stopped  and  stammered,  overcome  with surprise  to hear   himself saying such things. But Goldberry laughed.       'Welcome!'  she said.  'I had not heard that folk of the  Shire were so  sweet-tongued. But I see you are an elf-friend; the light  in your eyes  and  the ring in your voice tells it. This is  a merry meeting! Sit now, and wait  for the Master   of the house! He will not be long. He is tending  your tired  beasts.'       The hobbits sat down gladly in  low rush-seated chairs, while Goldberry  busied herself about the table; and their eyes followed her, for the slender   grace of her movement filled them with quiet delight. From somewhere  behind  the house came the sound of singing. Every now and again they caught,  among  many a derry dol and a merry dol and a ring a ding dillo  the repeated words:        Old Tom Bombadil is a merry fellow;        Bright blue his jacket is, and his boots are yellow.        'Fair  lady!'  said Frodo again after  a  while. 'Tell me, if my asking  does not seem foolish, who is Tom Bombadil?'       'He is,' said Goldberry, staying her swift movements and smiling.       Frodo looked a t her questioningly.  'He is, as you  have seen him,' she  said in answer to his look. 'He is the Master of wood, water, and hill.'       'Then all this strange land belongs to him?'       'No indeed!' she answered, and her smile faded. 'That would indeed be a  burden,'  she added  in  a low voice, as if to herself. 'The trees  and  the  grasses  and  all things growing  or  living  in  the  land belong  each  to  themselves.  Tom  Bombadil is the Master. No  one has ever  caught  old  Tom  walking in the forest,  wading in the  water, leaping on the hill-tops under   light and shadow. He has no fear. Tom Bombadil is master.'       A door opened and in came Tom Bombadil. He had now no hat and his  thick  brown  hair  was  crowned  with  autumn leaves.  He laughed,  and   going  to  Goldberry, took her hand.       'Here's my pretty  lady!'  he said,  bowing  to the hobbits. 'Here's my  Goldberry clothed all  in silver -green  with flowers in  her girdle! Is  the   ####-table  laden? I see yellow cream and honeycomb, and white bread, and butter;  milk, cheese,  and green herbs and ripe berries gathered. Is that enough for   us? Is the supper ready?'       'It is,' said Goldberry; 'but the guests perhaps are not?'       Tom clapped his hands and cried:  'Tom, Tom! your guests are tired, and  you had near forgotten! Come now,  my  merry  friends, and Tom  will refresh  you! You shall clean  grimy  hands, and wash your weary faces; cast off your  muddy cloaks and comb out your tangles!'       He  opened the door, and they followed  him  down  a short passage  and   round  a  sharp  turn. They  came  to  a low  room  with a  sloping  roof (a  penthouse, it  seemed, built on  to  the north end  of the house). Its walls  were  of clean stone, but they were  mostly covered  with green hanging mats  and  yellow curtains. The  floor  was flagged, and  strewn with  fresh green  rushes. There were four deep  mattresses, each  piled  with white  blankets,   laid on the floor along one side. Against the opposite wall was a long bench   laden with wide earthenware basins,  and beside it stood  brown ewers filled  with water, some cold, some steaming hot. There were soft green slippers set  ready beside each bed.       Before long, washed and  refreshed,  the  hobbits  were  seated  at the  table, two on  each side, while at e ither end sat Goldberry  and the Master.  It  was  a long and  merry  meal. Though  the hobbits ate, as only  famished  hobbits can eat, there was no lack. The drink in their drinking-bowls seemed  to be clear cold water, yet it went to  their hearts like  wi ne and set free  their  voices.  The guests  became  suddenly aware  that  they were  singing  merrily, as if it was easier and more natural than talking.       At  last Tom  and Goldberry rose and  cleared  the  table  swiftly. The  guests were  commanded to  sit  quiet,  and were set in chairs,  each with a   footstool to  his  tired  feet. There was a  fire  in the wide hearth before  them,  and  it  was  burning with  a  sweet smell, as  if it were  built  of  apple-wood. When  everything  was set in  order,  a ll the lights in the room  were put  out, except one  lamp  and  a pair of candles at each  end of  the  chimney-shelf. Then Goldberry came and  stood before them, holding a candle;  and she wished them each a good night and deep sleep.       'Have peace now,' she said, 'until the morning! Heed no nightly noises!  For nothing passes door and window here save moonlight and starlight and the  wind  off the hill-top."
