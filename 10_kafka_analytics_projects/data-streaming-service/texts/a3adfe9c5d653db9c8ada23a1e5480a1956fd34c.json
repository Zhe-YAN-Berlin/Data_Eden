  "text": "    Yes, but whom?    The realm,  Maester Luwin said,  and Winterfell. Theon, once I taught you sums and letters, history and warcraft. And might have taught you more, had you wished to learn. I will not claim to bear you any great love, no, but I cannot hate you either. Even if I did, so long as you hold Winterfell I am bound by oath to give you counsel. So now I counsel you to yield.   Theon stooped to scoop a puddled cloak off the floor, shook off the rushes, and draped it over his shoulders. A fire, I’ll have a fire, and clean garb. Where’s Wex? I’ll not go to my grave in dirty clothes.   You have no hope of holding here,  the maester went on.  If your lord father meant to send you aid, he would have done so by now. It is the Neck that concerns him. The battle for the north will be fought amidst the ruins of Moat Cailin.    That may be so,  said Theon.  And so long as I hold Winterfell, Ser Rodrik and Stark’s lords bannermen cannot march south to take my uncle in the rear.  I am not so innocent of warcraft as you think, old man.  I have food enough to stand a year’s siege, if need be.    There will be no siege. Perhaps they will spend a day or two fashioning ladders and tying grapnels to the ends of ropes. But soon enough they will come over your walls in a hundred places at once. You may be able to hold the keep for a time, but the castle will fall within the hour. You would do better to open your gates and ask for—    —mercy? I know what kind of mercy they have for me.    There is a way.    I am ironborn,  Theon reminded him.  I have my own way. What choice have they left me? No, don’t answer, I’ve heard enough of your counsel. Go and send those birds as I commanded, and tell Lorren I want to see him. And Wex as well. I’ll have my mail scoured clean, and my garrison assembled in the yard.   For a moment he thought the maester was going to defy him. But finally Luwin bowed stiffly.  As you command.   They made a pitifully small assembly; the ironmen were few, the yard large.  The northmen will be on us before nightfall,  he told them.  Ser Rodrik Cassel and all the lords who have come to his call. I will not run from them. I took this castle and I mean to hold it, to live or die as Prince of Winterfell. But I will not command any man to die with me. If you leave now, before Ser Rodrik’s main force is upon us, there’s still a chance you may win free.  He unsheathed his longsword and drew a line in the dirt.  Those who would stay and fight, step forward.   No one spoke. The men stood in their mail and fur and boiled leather, as still as if they were made of stone. A few exchanged looks. Urzen shuffled his feet. Dykk Harlaw hawked and spat. A finger of wind ruffled Endehar’s long fair hair.  Theon felt as though he were drowning. Why am I surprised? he thought bleakly. His father had forsaken him, his uncles, his sister, even that wretched creature Reek. Why should his men prove any more loyal? There was nothing to say, nothing to do. He could only stand there beneath the great grey walls and the hard white sky, sword in hand, waiting, waiting…  Wex was the first to cross the line. Three quick steps and he stood at Theon’s side, slouching. Shamed by the boy, Black Lorren followed, all scowls.  Who else?  he demanded. Red Rolfe came forward. Kromm. Werlag. Tymor and his brothers. Ulf the Ill. Harrag Sheepstealer. Four Harlaws and two Botleys. Kenned the Whale was the last. Seventeen in all.  Urzen was among those who did not move, and Stygg, and every man of the ten that Asha had brought from Deepwood Motte.  Go, then,  Theon told them.  Run to my sister. She’ll give you all a warm welcome, I have no doubt.   Stygg had the grace at least to look ashamed. The rest moved off without a word. Theon turned to the seventeen who remained.  Back to the walls. If the gods should spare us, I shall remember every man of you.   Black Lorren stayed when the others had gone.  The castle folk will turn on us soon as the fight begins.    I know that. What would you have me do?    Put them out,  said Lorren.  Every one.   Theon shook his head.  Is the noose ready?    It is. You mean to use it?    Do you know a better way?    Aye. I’ll take my axe and stand on that drawbridge, and let them come try me. One at a time, two, three, it makes no matter. None will pass the moat while I still draw breath.   He means to die, thought Theon. It’s not victory he wants, it’s an end worthy of a song.  We’ll use the noose.    As you say,  Lorren replied, contempt in his eyes.  Wex helped garb him for battle. Beneath his black surcoat and golden mantle was a shirt of well-oiled ringmail, and under that a layer of stiff boiled leather. Once armed and armored, Theon climbed the watchtower at the angle where the eastern and southern walls came together to have a look at his doom. The northmen were spreading out to encircle the castle. It was hard to judge their numbers. A thousand at least; perhaps twice that many. Against seventeen. They’d brought catapults and scorpions."
