'There's Ugl®k! I don't want to  meet him again.' The hobbits turned and  fled deep into the  shadows of  the  wood.       So it  was  that  they did not sec  the  last  stand,  when  Ugl®k  was  overtaken and brought to bay at the very edge of Fangorn. There he was slain  at last by Jomer,  the Third Marshal  of the Mark, who dismounted and fought  him  sword to sword.  And over  the  wide fields the keen-eyed Riders hunted  down the few Orcs that had escaped and still had strength to fly.       Then when they had  laid their fallen comrades in a  mound and had sung  their praises, the Riders made a great fire and scattered the ashes of their  enemies.  So ended  the raid, and no  news  of  it came ever back either  to  Mordor or to Isengard; but the smoke of  the burning rose high to heaven and  was seen by many watchful eyes.      ####-<h4>Chapter 4.</h4> <br> Treebeard            Meanwhile the hobbits went with  as much speed as  the dark and tangled   forest allowed, following  the line of the  running  stream, westward and up  towards the slopes of the mountains, deeper and deeper into  Fangorn. Slowly  their fear of the Orcs died away, and their pace slackened. A queer stifling  feeling came  over  them,  as  if the air were  too thin or too  scanty  for   breathing.       At last Merry halted.  'We can't go on like this,' he  panted.  'I want  some air.'       'Let's have  a  drink  at any rate,'  said  Pippin. 'I'm  parched.'  He  clambered on to a  great tree-root that  wound  down  into the  stream,  and  stooping drew up some water in his cupped hands. It was clear and  cold, and  he  took many draughts.  Merry followed  him.  The water refreshed them  and  seemed  to cheer their hearts; for a while they sat together on the brink of  the  stream,  dabbling  their  sore feet and legs, and peering round at  the  trees that  stood silently about them, rank upon rank, until they faded away  into grey twilight in every direction.       'I suppose you  haven't  lost us already?'  said  Pippin,  leaning back   against  a great tree-trunk.  'We  can  at  least follow the  course of this  stream, the Entwash or whatever you call  it, and get  out again  the way we  came.'       'We could, if  our legs  would  do it,' said  Merry;  'and if  we could  breathe properly.'       'Yes, it is  all  very  dim,  and stuffy,  in   here,' said Pippin.  'It  reminds me, somehow, of the  old room in the  Great Place of  the Tooks away  back in the  Smials at Tuckborough:  a huge place,  where  the furniture has  never been moved or changed for generations. They say  the Old Took lived in  it  year  after  year,  while  he  and  the  room  got  older  and  shabbier   together -and  it has  never changed since  he  died, a century ago.  And Old  Gerontius was my great-great-grandfather: that  puts it back a bit. But that  is  nothing  to the old feeling of  this  wood.  Look at  all those weeping,  trailing,  beards and whiskers of lichen! And  most of the trees seem  to be  half covered with ragged dry  leaves that have never fallen. Untidy. I can't   imagine what spring  would look  like here, if  i t ever comes; still  less a   spring-cleaning.'   ####-     'But the Sun at any  rate must peep in sometimes.' said Merry. 'It does  not look or feel at all like Bilbo's  description of Mirkwood.  That was all  dark and black,  and the home  of dark black  things. This is just dim,  and  frightfully  tree-ish.  You  can't imagine animals  living here  at all,  or  staying for long.'       'No, nor hobbits,' said Pippin. 'And I don't like the thought of trying  to get through  it  either.  Nothing to cat  for a  hundred  miles, I should  guess. How are our supplies?'       'Low,'  said Merry.  'We ran  off  with nothing but a  couple of  spare  packets  of  lembas, and  left everything else behind.' They  looked at what  remained of the  elven-cakes:  broken  fragments for abou t five meagre days,  that  was all. 'And not a wrap or a blanket,' said Merry.  'We shall be cold  tonight, whichever way we go.'       'Well, we'd  better decide on  the way now,' said  Pippin. 'The morning  must be getting on.'       Just then they became  aware of a yellow light that  had appeared, some  way further  on into the  wood: shafts  of sunlight seemed  suddenly to have   pierced the forest -roof.       'Hullo!' said Merry.  'The Sun must have run into a cloud  while  we've  been under these  trees, and now she  has  run  out  again; or  else she has  climbed high enough to look down through some opening. It isn't far let's go  and investigate!'       They  found  it was  further than  they thought. The  ground was rising  steeply  still,  and  it was becoming  increasingly stony.  The  light  grew  broader as they went on, and soon they saw that there was a rock -wall before  them: the side of a hill, or the abrupt end of  some long root thrust out by  the distant mountains."
