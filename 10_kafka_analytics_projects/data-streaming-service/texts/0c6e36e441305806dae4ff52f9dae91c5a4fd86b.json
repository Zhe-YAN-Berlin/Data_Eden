It  went up into the hills, not along the valley, I tell you.'       'Not  much use  are you,  you little snufflers?' said the  big  orc. 'I   reckon eyes are better than your snotty noses.'       'Then what  have  you  seen with them?' snarled the  other.  'Garn! You    ####-don't even know what you're looking for.'       'Whose  blame's that?'  said the  soldier. 'Not mine. That  comes  from  Higher Up.  First they  say  it's a great Elf in bright armour, then  it's a   sort of small dwarf-man, then it must be a pack of rebel Uruk -hai; or  maybe   it's all the lot together.'       'Ar!' said the tracker. 'They've lost their  heads, that's what it  is.   And some of the bosses are going to lose their skins too, I guess, if what I  hear is true: Tower raided and all, and hundreds of your  lads done in,  and  prisoner got  away.  If that's  the  way you fighters  go on,  small  wonder  there's bad news from the battles.'       'Who says there's bad news?' shouted the soldier.       'Ar! Who says there isn't?'       'That's cursed rebel-talk, and I'll  stick  you, if  you don't shut  it  down, see?'       'All right, all right!' said  the tracker. 'I'll say  no more and go on  thinking.  But what's  the black  sneak got to do with  it all? That gobbler   with the flapping hands?'       'I  don't know. Nothing, maybe.  But he's up to no good, nosing around,  I'll  wager. Curse him! No sooner had  he slipped us and run  off than  word  came he's wanted alive, wanted quick.'       'Well,  I hope they  get  him and  put him  through  it,'  growled  the  tracker.  'He  messed up  the  scent  back  there,  pinching  that  cast -off  mail-shirt  that he  found,  and paddling all round the place before I could  get there.'       'It  saved his  life anyhow,' said  the soldier. 'Why, before I knew he  was wanted I shot him, as neat as neat, at fifty  paces  right in the  back;  but he ran on.'       'Garn!  You missed him,' said the  tracker. 'First you shoot wild, then  you run too  slow, and then you  send for the poor trackers. I've had enough  of you.' He loped off.       'You come back,' shouted the soldier, 'or I'll report you!'       'Who to? Not to your precious Shagrat. He won't be captain any more.'       'I'll  give  your  name and  number  to the Nazgyl,'  said  the soldier   lowering his voice to a hiss. 'One of them's in charge at the Tower now.'       The other halted, and his voice was  full of fear and rage. 'You cursed  peaching sneakthief!' he yelled. 'You can't do  your job, and you can't even  stick by your own folk. Go to your filthy Shriekers, and may they freeze the   ####-flesh off you! If the enemy  doesn't get them  first. They've done in Number   One, I've heard, and I hope it's true!'       The big orc, spear in hand, leapt after him. But the tracker, springing  behind  a  stone,  put an arrow in  his eye as he ran up, and he fell with a   crash. The other ran off across the valley and disappeared.       For a while the hobbits sat in silence. At length  Sam stirred. 'Well I  call  that  neat as neat,'  he said. 'If this nice friendliness would spread  about in Mordor, half our trouble would be over.'       'Quietly,  Sam,' Frodo whispered. 'There  may be  others about. We have  evidently had  a very narrow escape,  and the  hunt was hotter on our tracks  than we guessed. But that is the spirit of Mordor, Sam; and it has spread to  every corner of it. Orcs have always behaved like that, or so all tales say,  when they are on their own. But you can't get much hope out of it. They hate  us far  more,  altogether  and all the time. If  those two had seen us, they  would have dropped all their quarrel until we were dead.'       There was another long silence. Sam broke it again,  but with a whisper   this time.  'Did you hear what they  said  about  that gobbler, Mr.  Frodo? I  told you Gollum wasn't dead yet, didn't I?'       'Yes, I remember. And I wondered  how you knew,' said Frodo. 'Well come  now!  I think we had better not move out from here again,  until it has gone  quite dark. So  you shall tell me how you know, a nd all about what happened.  If you can do it quietly.'       'I'll try,' said Sam, 'but when I think of  that Stinker I get so hot l  could shout.'       There the hobbits sat under the  cover  of  the  thorny bush, while the  drear light of  Mordor faded slowly into a deep and starless night; and  Sam  spoke into Frodo's  ear  all  that he  could  find  words  for  of  Gollum's  treacherous  attack, the  horror of Shelob, and his  own adventures with the  orcs. When  he  had finished,  Frodo said nothing  but  took  Sam's hand and   pressed it. At length he stirred.       'Well, I  suppose  we  must be going on  again,' he said. 'I wonder how  long it will be before  we really are  caught  and all the  toiling and  the  slinking will be over, and in vain."
