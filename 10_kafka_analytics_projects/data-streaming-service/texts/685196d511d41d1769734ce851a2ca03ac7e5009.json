We may ride  it swiftly and without great rumour.'       'Then  since we  must  look  for  fell deeds and  the  need  of all our   ####-strength,' said Jomer,  'I  counsel that we  rest now, and set out hence  by  night, and so  time our going that we come upon the fields  when tomorrow is  as light as it will be, or when our lord gives the signal.'       To this the king  assented, and the captains departed. But soon Elfhelm  returned.  'The scouts  have found naught  to  report beyond  the grey wood,  lord,' he said, 'save two men only: two dead men and two dead horses.'       'Well?' said Jomer. 'What of it?'       'This, lord: they were errand-riders  of  Gondor; Hirgon was one maybe.  At least his hand  still clasped  the Red Arrow, but his head was  hewn off.  And this  also:  it would  seem by the signs that they were fleeing westward  when they fell. As I read it, they found the enemy already on the  out-wall,  or assailing it, when they  returned - and that would  be two nights ago, if  they  used  fresh  horses  from the posts, as is their wont. They  could not  reach the City and turned back.'       'Alas!' said  Thjoden. 'T hen  Denethor has heard  no news of our riding  and will despair of our coming.'       'Need brooks no delay, yet late is better than never,' said Jomer. 'And  mayhap in this time shall the old saw be proved truer than ever before since   men spoke with mouth.'       It was night. On either side of the  road the  host of Rohan was moving  silently.  Now  the  road  passing  about the skirts  of  Mindolluin  turned  southward. Far away and almost straight ahead there was a red glow under the  black sky and  the sides of the great mountain  loomed dark against it. They   were drawing near the Rammas of the Pelennor; but the day was not yet come.       The  king rode in the  midst  of the leading company, his household-men  about him. Elfhelm's  jored came  next; and now Merry noticed  that  Dernhelm  had left his place and in the darkness was moving steadily forward, until at  last he was riding  just  in rear of the  king's guard. There came  a check.  Merry  heard voices  in front speaking softly.  Out-riders had come back who  had ventured forward almost to the wall. They came to the king.       'There are great  fires, lord,'  said one. 'The City is  all set  about  with flame, and the field  is full of foes.  But all seem drawn off  to  the  assault. As well as we could guess, there  are  few left  upon the out-wall,  and they are heedless, busy in destruction.'       'Do you remember the  Wild Man's words,  lord?' said another.  'I  live  upon the open Wold in days of peace;  Wndfara is my name, and to me also the  air brings messages. Already the  wind  is turning. There comes a breath out   ####-of the South;  there  is a sea -tang in it, faint  though it be.  The morning  will bring new things.  Above  the reek  it will  be dawn  when you pass the  wall.'       'If  you speak truly, Wndfara, then  may  you live beyond  this day  in  years of blessedness!' said Thjoden.  He turned to the  men of his household  who were  near, and he spoke now  in a clear voice  so that many also of the  riders of the first jored heard him:       'Now is the hour come, Riders of the Mark, sons  of Eorl! Foes and fire  are before you,  and your homes far  behind.  Yet, though you fight upon  an  alien field, the glory that you reap there shall be your own for ever. Oaths  ye  have  taken:  now fulfil them  all,  to  lord  and  land  and league  of  friendship!'       Men clashed spear upon shield.       'Jomer, my son! You  lead the first jored,' said Thjoden; 'and it shall  go behind the king's banner in the centre. Elfhelm, lead your company to the  right when we pass the wall.  And  Grimbold shall lead his towards the left.  Let  the other companies behind follow these three that lead,  as  they have  chance.  Strike wherever the  enemy gathers. Other plans we cannot make, for   we know  not  yet  how things  stand upon the field.  Forth now, and fear no   darkness!'       The leading company rode off as swiftly as they could, for it was still  deep dark,  whatever change Wndfara  might forebode. Merry was riding  behind  Dernhelm,  clutching  with the  left hand  while  with the other he tried to  loosen his sword in its sheath. He felt now  bitterly  the  truth of the old  king's  words: in such  a battle what would you do Meriadoc?  Just this,' he  thought: 'encumber a rider, and hope at best to stay in my  seat and  not be  pounded to death by galloping hoofs!'       It was no  more than a  league  to where the out-walls had stood.  They  soon reached them; too soon for  Merry. Wild cries broke out, and  there was  some clash of arms, but it was brief. The orcs busy about the walls were few   and amazed, and they were quickly  slain or driven off."
