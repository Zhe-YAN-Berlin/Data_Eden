Then  Pippin cried aloud, for the Tower  of  Ecthelion, standing high  within  the  topmost walls' shone  out against the  sky, glimmering like a spike of pearl  and silver, tall and fair and shapely, and its pinnacle  glittered as if  it  were wrought of crystals;  and white  banners  broke and  fluttered from the  battlements in the morning breeze' and high and far he heard a clear ringing  as of silver trumpets.       So Gandalf and Peregrin rode to the Great Gate  of the Men of Gondor at  the rising of the sun, and its iron doors rolled back before them.   ####-     'Mithrandir!  Mithrandir!' men  cried. 'Now we know that  the  storm is  indeed nigh!'       'It is upon you,' said  Gandalf. 'I  have  ridden  on its wings. Let me  pass!  I  must come  to  your  Lord Denethor, while his  stewardship  lasts.   Whatever betide, you have come to the end of the Gondor that you have  known.  Let me pass!'       Then men  fell back before the command of his voice  and questioned him  no further, though  they gazed in wonder  at the hobbit that sat before  him  and at the horse that bore him. For the people of  the City used horses very  little and they were seldom seen in their streets, save only those ridden by   the errand-riders of their  lord. And they said: 'Surely that is one  of the  great steeds of the  King  of  Rohan?  Maybe  the Rohirrim will come soon to  strengthen us.' But Shadowfax walked proudly up the long winding road.       For the  fashion  of  Minas Tirith was such that it was built on  seven  levels,  each  delved into the hill, and about each  was set a  wall, and in  each wall was a  gate. But the gates were not set in a line:  the Great Gate  in the City Wall was at  the  east  point of the circuit, but the next faced  half south, and the third half north, and so to and fro upwards; so that the  paved  way that climbed towards  the Citadel turned  first this way and then  that across the face of  the hill. And each  time that it passed the line of  the  Great Gate it went through an  arched  tunnel, piercing a  vast pier of  rock whose  huge out-thrust bulk  divided in two all the circles of the City  save the first. For partly in  the  primeval shaping  of the hill, partly by  the mighty craft and labour of old, there stood up from the rear of the wide  court behind the  Gate a  towering  bastion  of stone, its edge sharp  as  a   ship-keel facing east. Up it rose, even to the level of the  topmost circle,  and there was crowned  by  a battlement; so that those in the Citadel might,  like mariners in a mountainous ship, look  from  its peak sheer down upon the  Gate  seven  hundred  feet  below.  The entrance  to the Citadel also looked  eastward,  but  was delved in the  heart of the rock; thence a long lamp-lit  slope ran up to the seventh gate. Thus  men reached  at last the High Court,  and the Place of the  Fountain before the feet of the  White Tower: tall and  shapely,  fifty fathoms from its  base to the pinnacle, where the banner  of  the Stewards floated a thousand feet above the plain.       A  strong citadel  it was indeed,  and  not to be taken  by  a  host of  enemies, if  there were any within that could hold weapons;  unless some foe   ####-could come behind and scale the lower skirts of Mindolluin, and so come upon  the narrow shoulder that joined the Hill of Guard to the mountain  mass. But  that shoulder, which rose to  the height of the fifth wall, was hedged  with  great ramparts right up to the precipice that overhung its western end;  and  in that  space stood the houses and  domed tombs of bygone kings  and lords,  for ever silent between the mountain and the tower.       Pippin gazed in growing wonder at the great stone city, vaster and more  splendid  than  anything that he had dreamed of;  greater and  stronger than  Isengard, and far more beautiful.  Yet it was in truth falling year by  year  into decay; and already it lacked half the men that could have dwelt at ease  there. In  every street they passed  some  great house or  court  over whose  doors and arched gates were carved many fair letters  of strange and ancient   shapes: names Pippin  guessed of great men and kindreds that had once  dwelt  there;  and  yet now they were silent,  and no footsteps rang  on their wide  pavements, nor voice was heard in their halls, nor any face looked out  from  door or empty window.        At last they came out of  shadow to the seventh gate,  and the warm sun  that shone down beyond the river, as Frodo walked in the glades of Ithilien,  glowed here on the smooth walls and rooted pillars, and the great arch  with   keystone  carven  in  the  likeness of a crowned and  kingly  head.  Gandalf  dismounted, for no horse was allowed in the Citadel,  and Shadowfax suffered  himself to be led away at the soft word of his master."
