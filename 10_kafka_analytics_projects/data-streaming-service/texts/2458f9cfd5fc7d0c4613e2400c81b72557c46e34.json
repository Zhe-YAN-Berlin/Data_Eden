He drew  his sword and looked at it, and the intertwining shapes of red  and gold; and  the flowing characters of NÂ®menor glinted like fire upon  the  blade. 'This was made for just  such an hour,' he thought. 'If only  I could  smite that foul Messenger with  it, then almost I should draw level with old  Merry.  Well, I'll smite some of this beastly brood before the end. I wish I  could see cool sunlight and green grass again!'       Then  even  as he thought  these things the  first assault crashed into  them.  The orcs hindered by the  mires that  lay before the hills halted and  poured their arrows into the defending ranks.  But through them  there  came  striding  up,  roaring  like beasts, a  great company of  hill-trolls out of  Gorgoroth. Taller and broader than Men they were, and they were clad only in  close-fitting mesh of  horny  scales, or maybe  that was their hideous hide;  but they bore round  bucklers  huge and black and wielded heavy  hammers  in  their  knotted hands.  Reckless they sprang into the pools and waded across,   bellowing as they came. Like a  storm they broke upon the line of the men of  Gondor, and beat upon helm and head, and arm and shield as smiths hewing the  hot bending iron. At Pippin's  side Beregond was stunned  and overborne, and  he fell;  and the great  troll-chief that  smote  him  down  bent over  him,  reaching out  a  clutching  claw; for  these  fell creatures would bite  the  throats of those that they threw down.       Then  Pippin  stabbed  upwards, and  the  written blade of  Westernesse  pierced through the hide and went deep into the vitals of the troll, and his  black blood came gushing out. He toppled forward and came crashing down  like  a falling rock, burying those beneath him. Blackness and stench and crushing  pain came upon Pippin, and his mind fell away into a great darkness.       'So  it ends  as I  guessed  it  would,' his  thought said,  even as it  fluttered away; and  it laughed a little within him ere it fled, almost  gay  it seemed to  be  casting off at last all doubt and care and  fear. And then  even as  it  winged away into forgetfulness it heard voices, and they seemed  to be crying in some forgotten world far above:       'The Eagles are coming! The Eagles are coming!'       For one moment more Pippin's thought hovered.  'Bilbo!'  it  said. 'But   ####-no! That came in his tale, long long  ago. This is my  tale, and it is ended  now. Good-bye!' And his thought fled far away and his eyes saw no more.       ####-         * BOOK VI *    Chapter 1. The Tower of Cirith Ungol            Sam roused himself painfully from the ground. For a  moment he wondered  where he was, and then all the misery and despair returned to him. He was in  the deep dark outside the  under -gate of the orcs'  stronghold;  its  brazen  doors were shut. He must have fallen  stunned when he hurled himself against   them; but  how  long he had lain there he did not know. Then he  had been on  fire, desperate and furious;  now he was shivering and cold. He crept to the  doors and pressed his ears against them.       Far  within  he  could hear  faintly the voices of ores clamouring, but  soon they stopped or  passed out of hearing,  and  all was still.  His  head  ached and his eyes saw phantom lights in  the  darkness, but he struggled to  steady  himself and  think. It  was clear at any rate that he had no hope of  getting into the orc-hold by that gate; he might wait  there for days before  it was opened, and he could  not wait: time  was  desperately precious. He no  longer had any doubt about his duty: he must rescue  his master or perish in  the attempt.       'The  perishing is more  likely, and will be a lot  easier  anyway,' he  said grimly to  himself,  as  he sheathed Sting and turned  from  the brazen  doors. Slowly  he  groped his  way back in  the dark along  the  tunnel, not  daring to  use the elven -light; and as  he went he tried to fit together the  events since Frodo and he  had left  the  Cross-roads. He  wondered what the  time  was. Somewhere between one day and the next, he supposed;  but even of  the days he had  quite lost count. He  was in a  land  of darkness where the  days of the world seemed forgotten, and where all who entered were forgotten  too.       'I wonder if they  think of us at all,' he said, 'and what is happening  to them all away there.' He  waved his  hand vaguely  in the air before him;  but  he  was  in fact now facing southwards,  as  he  came back to  Shelob's  tunnel, not  west. Out westward in the world it was drawing to noon upon the  fourteenth day of  March in the  Shire-reckoning. And  even now  Aragorn was  leading  the  black  fleet  from  Pelargir,  and  Merry was riding with  the   ####-Rohirrim down the Stonewain Valley, while in Minas Tirith flames were rising  and Pippin watched the madness growing in the eyes of Denethor. Yet amid all  their cares and  fear  the thoughts of  their friends  turned  constantly to  Frodo and Sam."
