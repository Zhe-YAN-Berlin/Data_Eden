'Ill enough,' said Legolas,  'but not yet hopeless, while  we have  you   with us. Where is Gimli?'       'I do not  know.' said Aragorn. 'I last saw  him fighting on the ground  behind the wall, but the enemy swept us apart.'       'Alas! That is evil news,' said Legolas.       'He is  stout and strong,'  said Aragorn. 'Let  us  hope  that he  will  escape back to the caves. There he would be safe for a while. Safer than we.   ####-Such a refuge would be to the liking of a dwarf.'       'That must be my hope'' said Legolas. 'But I wish that he had come this  way. I desired to tell Master Gimli that my tale is now thirty-nine.'       'If he wins back to the caves, he will pass your  count again,' laughed  Aragorn. 'Never did I see an axe so wielded.'       'I must go  a nd seek some arrows,' said Legolas. 'Would that this night  would end, and I could have better light for shooting.'       Aragorn  now  passed into the  citadel. There to his  dismay he learned  that Jomer had not reached the Hornburg.       'Nay,  he did not come to the Rock,'  said one  of the Westfold-men,  'I  last saw him gathering men about him and fighting  in the mouth of the Deep.  Gamling was with him, and the dwarf; but I could not come to them.'       Aragorn strode  on  through  the  inner court,  and  mounted to a  high  chamber in  the tower. There stood  the king, dark  against a narrow window,  looking out upon the vale.       'What is the news, Aragorn?' he said.       'The Deeping Wall is taken, lord, and  all the  defence swept away; but  many have escaped hither to the Rock.'       'Is Jomer here?'       'No, lord. But many  of your men  retreated into the Deep; and some say  that Jomer was amongst them. In the narrows they may hold back the enemy  and  come within the caves. What hope they may have then I  do not know.'       'More than we.  Good  provision,  it is said. And  the air is wholesome  there because of  the outlets through fissures  in the rock  far above. None  can force an entrance against determined men. They may hold out long.'       'But the Orcs have brought a devilry from Orthanc,' said Aragorn. 'They  have a blasting fire, and with it they took the Wall. If they cannot come in  the caves, they may seal up those that are inside.  But now we must turn all  our thoughts to our own defence.'       'I fret in this prison,'  said Thjoden. 'If I could have set a spear in  rest, riding before my men upon the field, maybe I could have felt again the   joy of battle, and so ended. But I serve little purpose here.'       'Here at least you are guarded in the  strongest fastness of the Mark,'  said Aragorn.  'More  hope we  have to defend you  in  the Hornburg than  in  Edoras, or even at Dunharrow in the mountains.'       'It  is said  that the Hornburg  has  never  fallen  to  assault,' said   ####-Thjoden; 'but now my heart is doubtful. The world changes, and all that once  was strong now proves unsure. How shall any tower withstand such numbers  and  such reckless  hate? Had I known that the strength  of Isengard was grown so  great, maybe  l should  not so rashly have ridden forth to  meet it, for all  the arts of Gandalf. His counsel  seems  not now so good as it did under the  morning sun.'       'Do not judge  the counsel  of  Gandalf, until all is over, lord,' said  Aragorn.       'The  end will not be  long,'  said the king. 'But I will not end here,  taken like an old badger  in a trap. Snowmane and Hasufel  and the horses of  my guard are  in the inner court.  When  dawn comes, I  will bid  men  sound  Helm's horn,  and I  will ride forth.  Will  you ride  with me then, son  of  Arathorn? Maybe we shall cleave a road, or make such an end as will be worth  a song-if any be left to sing of us hereafter.'       'I will ride with you,' said Aragorn.       Taking  his leave, he returned to the walls, and passed round all their  circuit, enheartening the men, and lending aid wherever the assault was hot.   Legolas  went with  him.  Blasts of  fire leaped up from  below  shaking the  stones. Grappling-hooks were hurled, and ladders raised. Again and again the  Orcs gained the  summit of the outer wall, and again the defenders cast them  down.       At last Aragorn stood above the great gates, heedless  of the darts  of  the  enemy. As  he  looked forth he  saw the eastern sky grow  pale. Then he  raised his empty hand, palm outward in token of parley.       The Orcs yelled and jeered. 'Come down! Come down!' they cried. 'If you  wish  to speak  to us, come down! Bring out your  king!  We are the fighting  Uruk-hai.  We will fetch him from his hole,  if  he does not come. Bring out  your skulking king!'       'The king stays or comes at his own will,' said Aragorn.       'Then what are you doing here?' they answered. 'Why do you look out? Do  you wish to see the greatness of our army? We are the fighting Uruk-hai."
